<P>
Visualization of models in BRL-CAD need not
be restricted to viewing static images.
With the use of <A HREF="chapt9.html#tabinterp">tabinterp</A> and <A HREF="chapt9.html#tabsub">tabsub</A> the task of creating
motion picture sequences becomes quite manageable.
The result is that models can be viewed from a variety of positions as they
move, change, and evolve over time.
<P>
The tools discussed represent only one conceptual approach to
the problem of specifying frames to be generated for an animation sequence.
With the advent of ubiquitous desktop graphics displays, it should be
possible to create the sequences using a more visual and interactive approach.
Creating tools for this remains an area for further work.
<P>
The authors wish to thank Mike Muuss and Phil Dykstra for creating the
animation capabilities within rt and mged. The authors also thank Mike Muuss
for providing the documentation for
<A HREF="chapt9.html#tabinterp">tabinterp</A> and
<A HREF="chapt9.html#tabsub">tabsub</A> that appears in
<A HREF="chapt9.html#tabinterp">Appendix A</A>
and
<A HREF="chapt9.html#tabsub">Appendix B</A>
respectively.
