<DT><a NAME="ARB"><B>ARB</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>ARB</I> is a planar faced convex solid with a minumim of four unique vertices
and a maximum of eight unique vertices. The specific type of <I>ARB</I> is often referred
to by adding the number of unique vertices to the word <I>ARB</I>. For example, an <I>ARB8</I>
is the usual solid block, an <I>ARB4</I> is a triangular base pyramid, and an <I>ARB6</I>
may be a wedge shape.

<DT><a NAME="ARBN"><B>ARBN</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>ARBN</I> is a planar faced convex solid defined by any number of
bounding planes.

<DT><a NAME="ARS"><B>Arbitrary Facetted Solid</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Arbitrary Facetted Solid</I> (Also referred to as <I>ARS</I>)
is a planar faced solid defined by any number of curves. These curves are typically
planar <I>waterline</I> or <I>station</I> curves, but they are not restricted to
being planar. Each curve in a particular <I>ARS</I> must have the same number of points.
The first and last curves are normally degenerate curves consisting of repetitions of
one point to make up the correct number of points for a curve. Faces are built
by connecting corresponding points on adjacent curves. The curves are assumed to be closed,
so the last point on any curve is implicitly connected to the first point on the same curve

<DT><a NAME="EBM"><B>Extruded Bit Map</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Extruded Bit Map</I> (Also referred to as <I>EBM</I>)
is a solid based on a greyscale bitmap. The bitmap is an array of unsigned char values,
see bw(5), and is extruded by some distance. The <I>EBM</I> solid requires
the dimensions of the bitmap file (height and width in bytes), an extrusion length,
and a transformation matrix to position the <I>EBM</I>. Each byte in the
bitmap file is treated as the base of a cell that is extruded by the specified
extrusion length. If the value of the byte is non&#173zero, then that cell is considered solid.
<a href="http://web.arl.mil/software/brlcad/ebm/index.html">Using the EBM solid in BRL&#173CAD</a>
is a useful reference for the <I>EBM</I> solid.

<DT><a NAME="RHC"><B>Right Hyperbolic Cylinder</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Right Hyperbolic Cylinder</I> (Also referred to as <I>RHC</I>)
is a solid built by extruding a truncated hyperbola through a height vector.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="EHY"><B>Elliptical Hyperboloid</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Elliptical Hyperboloid</I> (Also referred to as <I>EHY</I>)
is a solid with an elliptical base and the remainder of the surface
defined by hyperbolas that run from any point on the ellipse, through
common vertex at some height above the ellipse, and back to the ellipse
at the point diametrically opposed to the starting point. The hyperbolas
may be further controlled by a distance from the hyperbolas to the vertex
of the asymptotes.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="EPA"><B>Elliptical Paraboloid</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Elliptical Paraboloid</I> (Also referred to as <I>EPA</I>)
is a solid with an elliptical base and the other surface defined by
parabolas starting from any point on the ellipse, passing through
a vertex at some height above the ellipse, and then back to the ellipse
at a point diametrically opposed to the starting point.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="RPC"><B>Right Parabolic Cylinder</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Right Parabolic Cylinder</I> (Also referred to as <I>RPC</I>)
is a solid built by extruding a truncated parabola through a height vector.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="ETO"><B>Elliptical Torus</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Elliptical Torus</I> (Also referred to as <I>ETO</I>)
is defined by sweeping an ellipse through a circular path. The plane of the ellipse
and the plane of the circular path are orthogonal.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="ELL"><B>Ellipsoid</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Ellipsoid</I> is a solid defined by three
mutually perpendicular semi&#173axes. When the axes are
of unequal length, an ellipsoid is generated. When the axes
are all the same lenth, a sphere is generated.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="HAF"><B>Half Space</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Half Space</I> is a solid used to cut the universe in half.
It is represented by a plane with an outward pointing normal. The half of the universe
that the normal points away from is the part that the <I>Half Space</I>
solid represents.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="HF"><B>Height Field</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Height Field</I> is a solid defined by a series of height measurments on
a regular grid. In addition to a file of height measurements, this solid also requires
a location vector, width and height direction vectors, and some scale factors.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="NMG"><B>N&#173Manifold Geometry</B></DT> (Also referred to as <I>NMG</I>)

<DD>The <I>Non&#173Manifold Geometry</I> solid is based on the description by
Kevin Weiler in ``The Radial Edge Structure: A Topological Representation
for Non&#173Manifold Geometric Modeling'' from <I>Geometric Modeling for CAD Applications</I>
(Springer Verlag, 1987). <a href="http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/papers/90nmg">Combinatorial
Solid Geometry, Boundary Representations, and Non_Manifold Geometry</a> contains
an detailed description of the <I>NMG</I> solid and its structures.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="PART"><B>Particle</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Particle</I> solid is a lozenge shaped object defined by
a vertex, a height vector and radii at both ends. The body of the <I>particle</I>
is either a cylinder or a truncted cone, depending on the values of the radii.
Each end of the <I>particle</I> is a hemisphere of the specified radius.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="PG"><B>Polysolid</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Polysolid</I> is defined by a set of planar polygons. Each polygon
may have up to 5 unique vertices. The vertices of each polygon must be in 
counter&#173clockwise order when viewed from outside the solid. The set of polygons
must completely enclose the interior of the <I>polysolid</I>.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="PIPE"><B>Pipe</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Pipe</I> solid is defined by a sequence of ``control'' points, each
with values for inner radius, outer radius, and bend radius. The actual <I>pipe</I>
starts at the first ``control'' point and ends at the last ``control'' point.
The intervening ``control'' points are replaced by circular bends with the
specified bend radius, so the <I>pipe</I> is not likely to actually pass through
these points. An inner radius of zero indicates a solid <I>pipe</I> or wire.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="SPLINE"><B>Spline</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Spline</I> solid is defined by a set of Non&#173Uniform Rational
B&#173Spline Surfaces (NURBS). There are no trimming curves in the <I>spline</I>
solid, so each NURB surface must exactly adjoin its neighbor so that the
interior of the spline solid is completely enclosed and no parts of any NURB
surface are dangling outside the solid.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="TGC"><B>Truncated General Cone</B></DT> (Also referred to as <I>TGC</I>)

<DD>The <I>TGC</I> solid is a truncated cone with possibly elliptical base and top.
The base and top must be parallel, but the height vector connecting the center of
the base with the center of the top does not need to be orthogonal to the base
or top.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="TOR"><B>Torus</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Torus</I> is defined by sweeping one circle through a larger circular path.
The planes of the circles are orthogonal.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="VOL"><B>VOL</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>VOL</I> solid is defined by a three dimenional array of unsigned char values.
The solid requires a file of these values, the dimensions of the file (in bytes), the
size of each cell, and high and low thresholds. Any value in the file that is between the
thresholds (inclusive) represents a solid cell.
