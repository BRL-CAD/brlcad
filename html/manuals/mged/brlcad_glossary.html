<DT><a NAME="AZIMUTH"><B>azimuth</B></DT>

<DD>Viewing aspects in <I>mged</I> may be specified in terms of <I>azimuth</I>,
<a href="#ELEVATION">elevation</a>, and <a href="#TWIST">twist</a>.
<center><a href="az_el.gif"><IMG SRC="az_el_sm.gif"></a></center>

<p>
<I>Azimuth</I>
is the angle (in degrees) around the <I>z</I>-axis
through which the viewing direction is rotated
from the positive <I>xz</I>-quarterplane
towards the positive <I>y</I>-axis.
When
<I>azimuth = <a href="#ELEVATION">elevation</a></I> = 0,
for instance,
viewing is parallel to the <I>x</I>-axis
in the direction of decreasing <I>x</I>.
When <I>azimuth</I> = 90 degrees,
viewing is parallel to the <I>yz</I>-plane
along some direction of decreasing <I>y</I>:
the precise direction within the <I>yz</I>-plane
being specified by the <a href="#ELEVATION">elevation</a>.
<I>Azimuth</I> can take on any real value.

<DT><a NAME="BOOLEAN"><B>Boolean</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>Boolean</I>
(i.e., set-theoretic)
operations of <I>union</I>, <I>intersection</I>, and <I>subtraction</I>
are used in <a href="#CSG">constructive solid geometry</a>
to build complex objects from simpler ones.

<HR>

<DT><a NAME="BREP"><B>Boundary Representation</B></DT>

<DD><I>Boundary Representation</I> (<I>BREP</I>) is  one of the two major types of
<a href="#MODEL">solid modelling</a>,
the other being <a href="#CSG">constructive solid geometry</a>.
<I>BREP</I> objects are built by describing the entire enclosing surface of an object.
This will typically involve a variety of surface types including, for example, planar, cylindrical,
NURB, and sperical surfaces. While objects in a BREP system may be built using <a href="#BOOLEAN">Boolean</a>
operations, the resulting object is typically stored a a set of enclosing surfaces.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="COMBINATION"><B>Combination</B></DT>

<DD>a <I>combination</I> is a formula for combining <a href="#SOLID">primitive solids</a> and/or
other combinations into a more complex shape. Each solid or other combination directly 
in this formula is referred to as a <a href="#MEMBER">member</a> of this combination. The formula
may invlove <I>intersection</I>, <I>subtraction</I>, and <I>union</I> operations,
and the <I>combination</I> may be assigned a <a href="#SHADER">shader</a> and a color. <I>Combinations</I>
are typically built in <I>mged</I> using the <a href="mged_cmds.html#c">c</a>,
<a href="mged_cmds.html#comb">comb</a>, <a href="mged_cmds.html#r">r</a>, or
<a href="mged_cmds.html#g">g</a> commands.<a href="#REGION">Regions</a> and <a href="#GROUP">
groups</a> are special types of <I>combinations</I>.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="CSG"><B>Constructive Solid Geometry</B></DT>

<DD>
<I>Constructive solid geometry</I> (<I>CSG</I>),
sometimes referred to as
<I>combinatorial solid geometry</I>,
is one of the two major types of <a href="#MODEL">Solid modelling</a> (The other being
<a href="#BREP">boundary representation</a>). In a <I>CSG</I> system, complex objects
are built by combining simpler objects, with <a href="#SOLID">primitive solids</a>
as the basic building blocks. The combinations make use of <a href="#BOOLEAN">Boolean</a>
operations,
and the resulting objects are stored as <a href="#TREE">trees</a>.
<I>BRL&#173CAD</I> is actually a hybrid of <I>CSG</I> and <I>BREP</I>,
but its main emphasis is on the <I>CSG</I> capabilities.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="DAG" NAME="DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH"><b>Directed Acyclic Graph</B></a></DT>
<DD>In a Directed Acyclic Graph, each node may refer to multiple objects, and
each object may be refered to multiple times.  However, no node is permitted
to refer to any of it's ancestors.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="ELEVATION"><B>elevation</B></DT>

<DD>Viewing aspects in <I>mged</I> may be specified in terms of
<a href="#AZIMUTH">azimuth</a>, <I>elevation</I>, and <a href="#TWIST">twist</a>.
<I>Elevation</I> is the angle (in degrees) through which
the viewing direction is rotated
out of the <I>xy</I>-plane
towards the positive <I>z</I>-axis
(see
<a href="#AZIMUTH">the illustration in the <I>azimuth</I> entry</a>).
When
<I>elevation</I> = 90 degrees,
for instance,
viewing is parallel to the <I>z</I>-axis
in the direction of decreasing <I>z</I>.
<I>Elevation</I> can take on any real value between -90 and +90 degrees.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="IDENT"><B>Ident</B></DT>

<DD>An <I>ident</I> (also referred to as <I>component ID</I>, <I>region ID</I>, <I>item</I>, or <I>ID code</I>)
 is a number assigned to a <a href="#REGION">region</a> to distiguish it
from all the other regions in the <I>BRL&#173CAD</I> model. This number is assigned by the user.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="INHERITANCE"><B>Inheritance</B></DT>

<DD><I>Inheritance</I> is an attribute of <a href="#COMBINATION">combinations</a> that
determines how shader attributes are handled when a <a href="#MEMBER">member</a> of a 
combination is itself a combination. If the <I>inheritance</I> flag is set to 1, then all
the shader attributes of combinations lower in
the <a href=#TREE>tree</a> are overidden by this
combination. If <I>inheritance</I> flag is set to 0, then the shader attributes
of this combination will be overidden by proprties from combinations higher in
the <a href=#TREE>tree</a>.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="LOS"><B>LOS</B></DT>

<DD>An <I>LOS</I> is a percentage (0 to 100) assigned to a <a href="#REGION">region</a>
 representing the percentage of
the <I>region</I> that consists of solid material. This information is assigned by the user
and is not directly used by <I>BRL&#173CAD</I>, but is reported to applications that need it.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="GIFTMAT"><B>Material code</B></DT>

<DD>A <a href="#REGION">region</a> may be assigned an integer material code by the user.
This is intended to identify the material used to build the part. The <I>material code</I>
is ignored by <I>BRL&#173CAD</I>, except to report it to application codes.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="GROUP"><B>group</B></DT>

<DD>A <I>group</I> is a <a href="#COMBINATION">combination</a> with all <I>union</I>
operators. Typically a <I>group</I> is used to combine components into a subsystem,
 subsystems into a system,
or systems into top level <I>group</I>.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="MEMBER"><B>Member</B></DT>

<DD> A <a href="#SOLID">primitive solid</a> or a <a href="#COMBINATION">combination</a> is referred
to as a member of a <I>combination</I> if it is directly referenced by the <I>combination</I>.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="MGED"><B>MGED</B></DT>

<DD><I>MGED</I> is the interactive graphical editor for <I>BRL&#173CAD</I>. It may be used
to view, modify, and create models. Normally, the user views the model in a wireframe
display in <I>MGED</I>.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="PATH"><B>Path</B></DT>

<DD>A <I>path</I> to an object in <I>BRL&#173CAD</I> is a list of <a href="#COMBINATION">combinations</a>
that ends at the desired object. The <I>path</I> is specified similar to a <I>path</I>
in the UNIX file system (with ``/'' characters as separators). Each element of the
<I>path</I> must be a <a href="#MEMBER">member</a> of the previous element. For example,
``left_arm/arm/hand/thumb'' might be a path from ``left_arm'' to ``thumb'' in some
<I>BRL&#173CAD</I> database indicating that ``arm'' is a <I>member</I> of
``left_arm'', ``hand'' is a member of ``arm'', and ``thumb'' is a member of ``hand''.
The <I>path</I> information implies a set of transformation matrices (each <I>member</I>
of a <I>combination</I> has a transformation matrix associated with it). As a <I>path</I>
is traversed, the effects of encountered transformation matrices are accumulated, and
typically applied to the object at the end of the <I>path</I>. This means that the
thumb referred to by the <I>path</I> ``left_arm/arm/hand/thumb'' is likely to be
in a different location and orientation (and possibly scaled) from the thumb
referred to by ``right_arm/arm/hand/thumb''.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="SOLID"><B>Primitive solid</B></DT>

<DD><I>Primitive solids</I> are the basic building blocks of <a href="#CSG">CSG</a>
<a href="#MODEL">solid modelling</a> systems. The <I>primitive solids</I>
available in <I>BRL&#173CAD</I>

<DT><a NAME="TREE"><B>tree</B></DT>

<DD>A tree is a <a href="#BOOLEAN">Boolean</a> expression
representing some combination of objects.
Strictly speaking,
this is an abuse of the term <I>tree</I>:
such <a href="#BOOLEAN">Boolean</a> expressions
are not trees
in either the computer-science or the graph-theoretic sense,
but are more correctly referred to
as acyclic directed graphs,
also known as <I><a href="#DAG">DAG</a></I>s.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a NAME="TWIST"><B>twist</B></DT>

<DD>Viewing aspects in <I>mged</I> may be specified in terms of
<a href="#AZIMUTH">azimuth</a>, <a href="#ELEVATION">elevation</a>, and <I>twist</I>.
<I>Twist</I> is the angle (in degrees)
around the screen-<I>z</I>-axis
through which the the (model-) <I>z</I>-axis
is rotated from the positive screen-<I>y</I>-axis
towards the positive screen-<I>x</I>-axis.
(see
<a href="#AZIMUTH">the illustration in the <I>azimuth</I> entry</a>).
When <I>twist</I> = 0,
for instance,
the positive <I>z</I>-axis
is some nonnegative multiple of the positive screen-<I>y</I>-axis.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="RAYTRACE"><B>Raytrace</B></DT>

<DD><I>Raytracing</I> is the main method of interrogation for <I>BRL&#173CAD</I> models.
It is performed by selecting a start point and a ray direction, then calculating the
intersections of this ray with all the <a href="#SOLID">primitive solids</a> it encounters.
The segements of the ray that intersect each primitive solid are then combined using the
<a href="#BOOLEAN">Boolean,</a> expressions for each <a href="#REGION">region</a> using those solids, to produce segments of the ray
that intersect each region along the ray. If the objective of the raytracing effort is
to produce an image, the calculations will typically be stopped after the first region
is encountered. The <I>BRL&#173CAD</I> <a href="#RT">RT</a> code performs such raytracing.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="REGION"><B>Region</B></DT>

<DD>A <I>region</I> is a <a href="#COMBINATION">combination</a> with a flag set to mark it
as a <I>region</I>. A region in <I>BRL&#173CAD</I> has special significance for analysis
codes. In addtion to all the attributes of any combination, a <I>region</I> also has an
<a href="#IDENT">ident</a> number, a <a href="#MATCODE">material code</a> number,
an <a href="#LOS">LOS</a> number,
and a <a href="#SPACE">space code</a> number. A <I>region</I> should not occupy the same
physical space as any other <I>region</I>. If two <I>regions</I> overlap, warning messages
will be printed during <a href="#RAYTRACE">raytracing</a>.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="RGB"><B>RGB</B></DT>

<DD><I>RGB</I> is an abbreviation for <I>Red</I>, <I>Green</I>, and <I>Blue</I>.
When a color is specified in <I>BRL&#173CAD</I>, it is in terms of its primary
color components. Each component may be from 0 to 255. An <I>RGB</I> of ``0 0 0''
is black, ``255 255 255'' is white, and ``0 255 0'' is green.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="RT"><B>RT</B></DT>

<DD><I>RT</I> is one of the codes in the <I>BRL&#173CAD</I> package. It is used to
<a href="#RAYTRACE">raytrace</a> a model and produce a color shaded image. <I>RT</I>
supports transparency, reflection, refraction, shadows, texture mapping, light sources,
and animation.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="SHADER"><B>Shader</B></DT>

<DD>A <I>shader</I> is a <I>BRL&#173CAD</I> module that performs calculations to
determine the actual pixel color to be displayed when a ray intersects an object
during rendering by <a href="#RT">RT</a>. <I>Shaders</I> are assigned to
<a href="#COMBINATION">combinations</a> by the user, and some allow additional
parameters to adjust their appearance. Some <I>shaders</I> available are <I>mirror</I>,
<I>glass</I>, <I>plastic</I>, <I>texture</I> (for texture mapping), and others.
Source code modules in the <I>RT</I> directory if the form <I>sh_*.c</I> correspond
to the available shaders.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="MODEL"><B>Solid Model</B></DT>

<DD>A <I>Solid Model</I> is a description of an object or objects
produced in such a way that any point can be classified as inside, outside, or
on the surface of a modelled object without ambiguity. This means that a true solid
model cannot have surfaces that do not completely enclose space, and solid objects
that are defined in the model must not be defined based on irrelevant variables
such as viewing direction.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="MODEL_COORDINATES"><B>Model Coordinates</B></DT>

<DD>In a <I>BRL&#173CAD</I> model, the <I>model coordinates</I> are the actual coordinates
of points on the model in <I>real</I> units. The origin of the <I>model coordinate</I>
system is selected by the user.
By convention,
a model in <I>BRL&#173CAD</I> is oriented so that
the positive <I>x</I>-axis points
from the model's back to its front,
the positive <I>y</I>-axis points
from the model's right to its left,
and,
since the coordinate system is right handed,
the positive <I>z</I>-axis points
from the model's bottom to its top.
All <I>BRL&#173CAD</I> models
are stored in millimeters, however the user may operate in nearly any units by using
the <I>mged</I> <a href="mged_cmds.html#units">units</a> command.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="QUATERNION"><B>Quaternion</B></DT>

<DD>Internal to <I>mged</I>, the viewing orientation is handled in terms of <I>quaternions</I>.
A <I>quaternion</I> is a method for representing an arbitrary rotation without the ambiguity
that accompanies some methods at the poles. A <I>quaternion</I> may be thought of as a vector
(defining an axis of rotation), and a rotation about that axis.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="SPACE"><B>Space Code</B></DT>

<DD>A <I>space code</I> (or <I>air code</I>) is assigned to <a href="#REGION">regions</a>
that are intended to represent air space rather solid parts of the model. The code number
distinguishes different air spaces from each other. Regions representing solid parts
must have a space code of 0. This information is assigned by the user,
but is ignored in <I>BRL&#173CAD</I> except to report it to application codes.
</DD>
<HR>

<DT><a name="VIEW_COORDINATES"><B>View Coordinates</B></DT>

<DD>When an object is displayed in the <I>mged</I> graphics window, it is converted from
<a href="#MODEL_COORDINATES">model</a> to <I>view</I> coordinates. The <I>view</I> coordinate
system has its origin at the center of the viewing cube (the center of the <I>mged</I>
display). The <I>view</I> X-axis always points to the right, the <I>view</I> Y-axis always
points toward the top of the display, and the <I>view</I> Z-axis always points out o fthe screen
towards the viewer. The visible portion of view space (known as the ``viewing cube'') extends
from -1.0 to +1.0 along each of the <I>view</I> axes.
