<title>XMGED - Modified Commands</title>
<h1>Modified Commands</h1>

<h2>MATER</h2>
        The mater command has been changed to handle the case where
	some or all parameters are entered on the command line. The parameters
	are positional, so they are expected to be in a certain order. If
	parameters are missing, the user will be prompted to enter them in.
	If entering rgb values via the  command line, they must all be
	entered or they will not be used. The ``del'' parameter may also be
	used on the command line.

<h2>PRESS</h2>
		The press command has been changed to include the following
	new options:

		These options appear somewhat cryptic, so a little explanation
	is in order. All non-arb options start with the solid type and are
	followed by some kind of edit description. For example, epa_sb represents
	a button in the epa solid edit menu that says ``scale B''. Another example,
	tgc_rh, represents a button in the tgc solid edit menu that says ``rotate H''.
	The first character after the underscore is either an m, s, or r that
	stands for move, scale or rotate respectively. The rest is used to describe
	the particular part of the solid to be edited.
<p>

		All arb options start with a description of the type of edit to be
	performed followed by the arb type and numbers representing the particular
	part of	the arb to be edited. For example, me8_12 represents a button in the
	arb8 solid edit menu that says ``move edge 12''. Further, rf4_124 represents a 
	button in the arb4 solid edit menu that says ``rotate face 124''. Here is a
	list of the prefixes and their respective meanings:

<pre>
	mp:	move point
	me:	move edge
	mf:	move face
	rf:	rotate face
</pre>

		For completeness, included below are the original options:
