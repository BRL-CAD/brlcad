<title>XMGED - New Buttons</title>
<h1>New Buttons</h1>

<h2>SAVE EDIT</h2>
		The ``save edit'' button allows the user, while in either the solid or
	object edit state, to save all edits and remain in the respective edit state.
	There is also a new command called savedit in mged proper.
	
<h2>ALT MOUSE MODE</h2>
		The alternative mouse mode can be toggled on/off by pressing the
	``alt mouse mode'' button. In this mode, the left button is used for
	translation, the middle button for rotation, and the right button for zoom.
	This mode is active only in the view state. So, if the state changes when
	in ``alt mouse mode'', the original mouse mode takes effect until	the view
	state is resumed.

<h2>MULTI VIEWS</h2>
		Pressing the ``multi views'' button toggles between displaying the
	main drawing window and the multi-views window. The multi-views window
	shows four different views at the same time. The default views shown are
	45,45, bottom, left and	top. All slider operations and view related commands
	affect only the lower right window which shares it's view with the main
	window. 

<h2>SWAP VIEWS</h2>
		The swap views mode can be toggled on/off by pressing the
	``swap views'' button. This mode can only take effect when in ``multi views''
	mode. This mode allows views to be swapped between the lower right window
	and any of the other three. For instance, a left button press in any window,
	except the lower right, puts that windows view into the lower right window.
	A middle button press swaps that window's view with the view in the lower
	right window. And a right button press puts the lower right window's view
	into the window where the button press occurred. However, mouse button
	presses in the lower right window continue to function normally. That is,
	they continue to function according to the current mouse mode.
	
<h2>INPUT WIN</h2>
		Display of the input window can be toggled by pressing the
	``input win'' button. However, this button becomes insensitive when in
	single display mode. The input window is used to capture events
	(buttonpress, motion, keypress, etc.) so that objects can be manipulated
	remotely while in multi-display mode.

<h2>RATE BASED</h2>
		The sliders can be used in either rate based or absolute mode.
	In rate based mode, the slider value represents a rate of motion. And in
	absolute mode the slider value represents a absolute translation or 
	rotation, thereby affording the user more control over object movement.
	When in absolute mode the labels for xslew, yslew and zslew change to
	xtran, ytran, and ztran respectively. In either mode, the mouse is still
	able to manipulate the object(s).

<h2>HELP</h2>
		Display of the help menu can be toggled on/off by pressing the
	``help'' button. A list of all mged commands appears in the menu. To see
	a short definition of a command, click on its' corresponding button.

<h2>FILE MENU</h2>
<h3>MGED DATABASE FILE</h3>
		Causes a copy of the current database to be made. The user
	is prompted for a file name. If no file name is given, no database
	file is created.

<h3>POSTSCRIPT FILE</h3>
		Copies the current display into a postscript file. The user
	is prompted for a file name. If no file name is given, no postscript
	file is created. For now, the postscript file also contains the old
	mged faceplate.

<h3>PIX FILE</h3>
		Raytraces the current display and puts the result into a file.
	The user is prompted for a file name. If no file name is given, it puts
	the result into a frame buffer. The user is also given the opportunity
	to change the default rt options.

<h3>OPEN</h3>
		Open another database. The user is prompted for a file name. If
	no file name is given, the user will be prompted to create a new database.
	At this time, if the user refuses to create a new database, the program
	is exited.

<h3>INSERT</h3>
		This causes another database to be inserted into the current
	database. The user is prompted for a file name.

<h3>SHOW INFO</h3>
		Toggles the display of the solid information window.

<h3>EXIT</h3>
		Quit mged.
