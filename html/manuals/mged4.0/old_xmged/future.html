noted that all of the XMGED features are still subject to change
based on user feedback and future design decisions.

<ul>
<li>Better help facility.  We are looking into a hypertext help facility.
<li>Provide a choice between using the Motif or Athena widget sets
<li>Read startup file that contains specifications for menus, key bindings,
  text colors, and the default views. These descriptions would be something
  like that found in a .mwmrc or .twmrc file.
