<title>XMGED - New Environment Variables</title>
<h1>New Environment Variables</h1>

<h2>MGED_SRC_DIR</h2>
	This defines the directory that is searched for command files to be
	used with the source command. If this is not defined or the command
	file is not found in this directory, the current directory is searched.
	If the command file is still not found, the user's home directory is
	searched.

<h2>MGED_HISTORY</h2>
	This defines the history file that is read in during the initialization
	process. If this is not defined, the current directory is searched for
	the file named .mged_histrc. Then, if the file is not found here, it
	is searched for in the user's home directory. The commands in this
	file are only loaded into the history list and not executed.

<h2>MGED_JOURNAL</h2>
	This defines the journal file that is written to when journalling is
	active. If this is not defined, the file named mged.journal is created
	and used in the current directory.
