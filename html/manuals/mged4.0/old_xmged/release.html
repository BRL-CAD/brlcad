<title>XMGED - About This Release</title>
<h1>About This Release</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
You will need to have acquired and installed BRL-CAD release 4.0 or
later in order to run this code.  You will need a machine with X11
and the Motif widget set.  All SGI machines come with Motif.  On
Suns and other machines this may be an extra cost option.

<h2>Getting the code</h2>
Source code for XMGED can be found via anonymous ftp from
<pre>
    ftp.arl.army.mil:brl-cad/xmged/xmged-src.tar.Z.
</pre>
<p>
Binaries for an SGI running IRIX 4.0.5 (and perhaps later)
are available:
<pre>
    ftp.arl.army.mil:brl-cad/xmged/xmged-sgi.tar.Z.
</pre>
<p>
Binaries for a Sun3 running SunOS 4.x are available:
<pre>
    ftp.arl.army.mil:brl-cad/xmged/xmged-sun3.tar.Z.
</pre>
<p>
Binaries for a Sun4 running SunOS 4.x or Solaris are not
yet available, since we don't have Motif on a Sun4.  For
such machines you will have to build from sources, which
is really recommended in any case.
<p>
Like the cad distribution, these source and binary files are
encrypted.  The encryption key is the same as that used for
the BRL-CAD distribution.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Change to the top level of your BRL-CAD source tree.
Decrypt, uncompress, and untar the xmged distribution.
<pre>
    crypt xxx < xmged-src.tar.Z | zcat | tar xvf -
</pre>
where xxx is the encryption key you were given for the
BRL-CAD distribution.  This will create a new directory
called xmged.  Look at the Cakefile.defs file in this
directory.  xmged has been setup to use its own Cakefile.defs
rather than the one in the BRL-CAD root directory.  This was so it
could include its own definitions and X libraries without
interfering with the regular BRL-CAD distribution.
Check the definition of NFS to see if if agrees with the
way you setup your distribution.  Check the defines in your
Cakefile.defs against those in xmged.
<p>
<hr>
<b>You need to move xmged/db_io.c into librt/db_io.c and
rebuild librt.  There was a bug in the distributed
librt that will lead to corrupted databases if xmged is
used and this fix is not applied!</b>
<hr>
<p>
If you are compiling with the NFS option in Cakefile.defs set to 0,
you should be able to run "cake" in the xmged directory.
<p>
If you are compiling with the NFS option in Cakefile.defs set to 1,
make a directory .xmged.xxx for your machine type and link the
xmged/Cakefile to a Cakefile in that directory.  E.g. on
an SGI running IRIX 4.x:
<pre>
    mkdir .xmged.5d
    cd .xmged.5d
    ln -s ../xmged/Cakefile Cakefile
</pre>
You would then compile xmged via "cake" within that directory.
<p>
You may wish to install the XMged resources file, or at least
examine it to see about modifying things to taste.
