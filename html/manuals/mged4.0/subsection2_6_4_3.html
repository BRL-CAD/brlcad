<P>
The left and right mouse buttons are used for binary (2x) zooming,
and the center mouse button is used for all other MGED mouse functions.
<P>
On the Silicon Graphics 3-D workstations, MGED can be run directly,
or it can be run under the window manager MEX.  In both cases,
MGED opens two windows, one outlined in white for all text interaction,
and one outlined in yellow for all graphics display.
When running MGED directly (without MEX), all mouse events are
sent the MGED, regardless of where the mouse is pointing.
In order to shift emphasis between the graphics and text windows,
the smaller one can be enlarged by pointing the cursor within the
boundaries of the smaller window, and pressing the center button.
This enlarges that window, and reduces the size of the other window.
<P>
When MEX is running, it is necessary to follow the MEX convention of
moving the cursor into the desired window, and clicking the right mouse
button, to ``attach'' all input to that window.
This has the unfortunate consequence of requiring a lot of extra
mouse clicking, because the graphics window needs to be attached
when using the buttons, knobs, and mouse, while the text window
needs to be attached in order to enter keyboard commands.
<P>
On the Silicon Graphics 4-D workstations running 4Sight,
mouse events are sent to MGED only when the cursor is within the
boundaries of the MGED graphics window.
