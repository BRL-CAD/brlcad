<P>
Once you have finished creating all your solids, positioned them in
their correct relationships to each other, formed all your regions (forming
your finished object), created groups (if required), you can now do a ray-
tracing of the view displayed on the screen.
<P>
Note!  If you want to display solids or objects (collection of solids
regioned together) of different colors, each of the solids or objects must be
separate regions so you can give them a specific color.
<P>
The raytracing command is
<em>rt [-s#]
</em>
<P>
This command produces a color shaded image of the solids or objects on
the display.  This color shaded image  will appear on a frame buffer display.
The resolution of the image (number of rays) is equal to &quot;#&quot; from the &quot;-s&quot;
option.  If the &quot;-s&quot; option is absent, 50x50 ray solution will be used (very
course raytrace).  The higher the &quot;-s&quot; option the better the raytracing, but
it takes longer to display.
Recommended optimun value of &quot;-s&quot; option for picture
quality and speed of display is 256!.  Some examples follow:
<P>
<em>rt -s128 <BR>rt <BR>rt -s256 <BR></em>
<P>
When the rt command is given the text and graphic window will appear,
then the frame buffer starts to appear (the picture window).  The first scaned
display will be what was previously stored in it, it will then over write it
with your picture; sometimes two buffer scans are displayed before yours.
<P>
The default background color is blue with steel grey colored solids and 
objects.  The terminal will beep when the scanned picture is finished; press
return to get back to the &quot;text and graphic&quot; window.
<P>
With the blue background it is sometimes hard to visualize the raytraced
picture; two things you can do to improve the situation is:
     (a)  Make separate regions for all solids and objects, so that you can
assign a specific color to each region; this can be a time consuming task if
you have a lot of solids and objects.
     (b)  Construct as a separate region, three thin flat plates to form two
walls with a bottom, as shown below; using &quot;make name arb8&quot;,
then solid editing this arb8, using move faces to the required thickness,
then use command &quot;cp&quot;
(copy command) to make two more copies which you can rotate to their
respective relationships, then translate all three into the correct positions
relative to each other and the solids and objects you are displaying.
<P>
The advantage of doing this is to give the light source something
to reflect off, giving back lighting; improving contrast considerably.
With the
three plates formed into their own region you can delete them from the screen
with the &quot;d&quot; command, rotate your creation then re-display your plates (walls)
with the &quot;e&quot; command to do another rt, the walls need to be deleted from the
display when you rotate your objects,
otherwise everything will rotate together.
<P>
A bonus of having constructed these three walls is that you can quickly
change the material type to &quot;mirror&quot; so that you can get reflections of the
three hidden faces.
