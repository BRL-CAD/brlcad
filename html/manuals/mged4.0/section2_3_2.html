It is important for a CAD system to have a certain degree of independence
from any single display device in order to provide longevity of the
software and freedom from a single equipment supplier.
The MGED editor supports serial use of multiple displays by way of
an object-oriented programmatic
interface between the editor proper and the display-specific code.
All display-specific code for each type of hardware is isolated
in a separate <em>display manager</em> module.
High performance of the display manager was an important design goal.
Existing graphics libraries
were considered, but no well established standard existed with the necessary
performance and 3-dimensional constructs.
By having the display manager modules incorporated as a direct part of
the MGED editor, the high rates of display update necessary to deliver
true interactive response are possible, even when using CPUs of modest power.
<P>
An arbitrary number of
display managers may be included in a copy of MGED, allowing the user
to rapidly and conveniently move his editing session from display to display.
This is useful for switching between several displays, each of
which may have unique benefits:  one might have color capability,
and another might have depth cueing.
The <b>release</b> command closes out MGED's use of the current
display, and does an implicit attach to the ``null'' display manager.
This can be useful to allow another user to briefly examine an image
on the same display hardware without having to lose the state of
the MGED editing session.  The <b>attach</b> command is used to
attach to a new display via it's appropriate display manager routines.
If another display is already attached, it is released first.
The null display manager also allows the MGED editor to be run from a normal
alphanumeric terminal with no graphic display at all.  This can be useful
when the only tasks at hand involve viewing or changing
database structures, or entering or adjusting geometry parameters
in numerical form.
<P>
Creation of a new display manager module in the ``<b>C</b>'' language
<A HREF=bibliography2_21.html#cproglang>[RJLK78]</A>
generally takes an experienced
programmer from one to three days.
The uniform interface to the display manager provides two levels
of interactive support.
The first level of display support includes
the Tektronix 4014, 4016, and compatible displays,
including the Teletype 5620 bit-mapped displays.
However, while storage-tube style display devices allow MGED to
deliver the correct functionality, they lack the
rate of screen refresh needed for productive interaction.
The second level of support, including real-time interaction,
is provided by
the Vector General 3300 displays,
the Megatek 7250 and 7255 displays,
the Raster Technologies Model One/180 display,
the Evans and Sutherland PS300 displays
with either serial, parallel, or Ethernet attachment,
the Sun workstations,
and the Silicon Graphics IRIS workstation family.
