<em>push obj1 obj2 ... objn

This command will &quot;push&quot; an object's path transformations to the solid's parameters
located at the bottom of each path.
If a conflict is encountered, then an error message is printed and NOTHING is done.
A conflict occurs when the same solid &quot;ends&quot; different paths but the transformations
are different.
Conflicts could occur when &quot;instanced&quot; or &quot;copied&quot; groups occur in an object's
paths or when a solid is a member of 2 regions which have been edited separately.
A complication of this command, which will not be listed as a conflict, is when a solid's parameters have been
changed by a push, yet this solid is referenced by another object which was NOT
included in the push.
The user should beware of this situation.
This command can be very useful when &quot;adding&quot; parts from another file.
Once the &quot;object editing&quot; of these new parts is completed, the push command
will put the editing done to the solid level.
Since the added parts should have no cross-references with the existing
objects, there should be no problems.
