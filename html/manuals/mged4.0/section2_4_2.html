<P>
One of the critical aspects of a graphics software package
is its internal data structure.
Since geometric models often result
in very large volumes of data being generated,
the importance of the data structure here is emphasized.
Thus it is felt that a brief introduction to the
organization of the MGED database is
important for all users.
<P>
The database is stored as a single,
binary, direct-access
UNIX file for efficiency and cohesion,
with fixed length records called database <em>granules</em>.
Each object occupies one or more granules of storage.
The user sees and manipulates the directed acyclic graphs
like UNIX paths (e.g., car/chassis/door),
but in a global namespace.
There can be many independent or semi-independent
directed acyclic graphs within the same database,
each defining different models.
The figure also makes heavy use of the <em>instancing</em> capability.
As mentioned earlier, the
<em>leaves</em> of the graph are the primitive solids.
<P>
Commands exist to import sub-trees from other databases and libraries,
and to export sub-trees to other databases.
Also, converters exist to dump databases in printable form for
non-binary interchange.
