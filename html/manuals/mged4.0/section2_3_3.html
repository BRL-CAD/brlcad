Today, the half-life of computer technology is
approximately two to three years.
To realize proper longevity of the modeling software, it needs to be written
in a portable language to allow the software to be moved readily from
processor to processor without requiring the modeling software or users
to change.
Then, when it is desirable to
take advantage of the constantly increasing 
processor capabilities and similarly increasing memory capacity by replacing
the installed hardware base, there are a minimum of ancillary costs.
Also, it may be desirable to connect together processors from a variety
of vendors, with the workload judiciously allocated to
the types of hardware that best support the requirements of each particular
application program.
This distribution of processing when coupled with the fact that
users are spread out over multiple locations makes networking a vital
ingredient as well.

BRL's strategy for achieving this high level of portability was to target
all the software for the UNIX operating system,
<A HREF=bibliography2_21.html#unixtssys>[RT78]</A>,
with all the software written in the ``<b>C</b>''
programming language <A HREF=bibliography2_21.html#cproglang>[RJLK78]</A>.
The entire BRL-CAD Package, including the MGED editor
is currently running on all UNIX machines at BRL,
under several versions of the UNIX operating system, including
Berkeley 4.3 BSD UNIX, Berkeley 4.2 BSD UNIX, and AT&TSystem V UNIX.
<P>
The list of manufacturers and models of CPUs that support the UNIX
operating system <A HREF=bibliography2_21.html#moderntoolshires>[Dei84]</A>
is much too lengthy to include here.  However, BRL
has experience using this software on
DEC VAX 11/750, 11/780, 11/785 processors,
Gould PN6000 and PN9000 processors,
Alliant FX/8 and FX/80 processors (including systems with eight CPUs),
Silicon Graphics IRIS 2400, 2400 Turbo, 3030, 4-D, and 4-D/GT workstations,
the Cray X-MP, the Cray-2,
and the ill-fated Denelcor HEP H-1000 parallel supercomputer.
