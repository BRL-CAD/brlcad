<P>
Modeling practices using MGED can be quite individual.  The following is a
suggested modeling method to start with; you may end up developing your own
style as you become more familiar with MGED.
<P>
First of all, decide how you want to represent your model, including the
amount of detail, types of solids and regions necessary.  Have an accurate
sketch or engineering drawing available, so that you can easily tranfer its
information into the types of primitive solids necessary to create your model.
Where possible it is recommended to start with a large block solid and
``subtract'' pieces from it.  In this way you avoid errors with abutting
faces of a collection of solids ``unioned'' together.
<P>
Next the solids are created using the
<em>make</em>, <em>cp</em>, <em>mirror</em> or <em>in</em> 
commands.  Depending on the complexity of the model, the solids may be
created in the desired location or created at the origin and later
translated to the desired location.  Creation at the origin provides
an opportunity to take advantage of possible symmetries in the geometry.
Once all the solids are finished it is time to create the region[s],
which will describe (to MGED) how to combine the solids to represent
the model.
<P>
The region[s] are then given the desired item/air code (if this is
necessary, otherwise leave it as the system default value), and material
codes.  The regions are then put onto a group, usually for functionality only.
A group has no operations as such (like union [u], intersection [+] or
difference [-]) and is just a collection of objects for convenient naming
of a whole screen or collection of objects.
