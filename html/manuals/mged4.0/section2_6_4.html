<P>
Moving the mouse or the data tablet ``pen'' causes a cursor
on the screen to move.
The screen X-Y coordinates of the cursor can be sensed by MGED
at any time.
Clicking one of the mouse buttons,
or depressing the tip of the pen, results in MGED receiving
a special event notification.
The meaning of this mouse event depends on the current editing mode
and which portion of the display faceplate that the cursor is located
in.
<P>
Below is a list of some of the functions the mouse is used for in MGED;
<UL><LI>
Selecting editing menus, edit functions (move faces, move edges
etc.) and viewing functions (selected from main edit menu); move
pointer to appropriate edit function and press center mouse button.
<LI>
Pointing functions; interactively positioning solid primitive 
relative to other solids with positioning or size update being 
displayed at the same time, position pointer where required and click
center mouse button.
<LI>
Scaling of view size; enlarge or reduce for a more detailed view of
object, left button shrinks view size, right button enlarges view
size.
<LI>
During the solid or object illuminate phase of editing,
the screen is divided into
invisible horizontal sections.
The available selections are scanned by moving the mouse up and down.
<LI>
When MGED is is the viewing state,
and a mouse event is received which is not in the menu area of the faceplate,
the point at which the cursor is pointing at will be translated to become
the center of the current view.
By pointing and clicking the center mouse button,
the center of the viewing cube
can be moved to allow close-up viewing of different areas in your
model.
