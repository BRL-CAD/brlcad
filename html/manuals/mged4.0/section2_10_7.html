There are two classes of editing operations that can be performed on
leaf nodes, the primitive solids.
The first class of operations are generic operations which can be applied to
any type of solid, and the second class of operations are those operations
which are specific to a particular type of solid.
Generic operations which can be applied to all primitive solids are
rotation, translation and scaling.
Recall that primitives can be treated as any other object and ``object
edited'' as detailed above.
Each primitive solid also has a variety of editing operations available that
are specific to the definition of that solid.  These operations are
detailed below.
<P>
The solid editing mode is necessary to
perform to basic shapes of solids.
Precise modifications
of the shape are possible (using the <em>p</em> keyboard command) in the solid
editing mode.
<P>
The solid editing feature allows the user to interactively translate,
rotate, scale, and modify individual parameters of a solid.  Whenever one is
in the solid edit mode, the parameters of the solid being edited are listed
and continually updated at the top of the screen.  Certain parameters are
also labeled on the solid being edited.  Solid editing  is generally used to
``build'' objects by producing solids of the desired shape and size in the
correct orientation and position.  Once the object is built, object editing
is used to scale, orient, and position the object in the description.  The
general philosophy of solid editing is to first create a solid with the
desired name and then to edit this solid.  As an example, suppose one were
to build an object called ``BRACKET''; to produce the base of the object the
primitive solid type ARB8 would be used along with either the
<em>in</em> command or <em>make</em> command, so one would type:
<P> 
in btm box 0 0 0  0 -90 0  40 0 0  0 0 6 <BR>make block arb8
  <P>A new solid called ``btm'' or ``block'' would be created and displayed on the
screen.  These solids would then be edited using solid editing to produce the
solid parameters for the shape desired.
