<title>XMGED - X11 Resources</title>
<h1>X11 Resources</h1>

You may wish to install the XMged resources file, or at least
examine it to see about modifying things to taste. You can
also set the environment variable XENVIRONMENT to the name
of the file where your preferred resources are stored.
<p>
The resource names for the buttons are identical to the button descriptions
as listed for the <a href="commands.html#button">button</a> command
except that the spaces are replaced by underscores. The resource names
for the sliders and the help list buttons are the same as their respective labels. The
remainder of the pertinent resource names are listed in a table below.
Also, listed below are the widget classes used in the implementation.
