<title>XMGED - Command Editing and History</title>
<h1>Command Editing and History</h1>

	The new text window has command line editing. The functionality
is similar to that of tcsh. Below is a list of the features that have
been implemented.
<p>

<pre>
    ^p    previous command
    ^n    next command
    ^b    backward one character
    ^f    forward one character
    ^a    beginning of line
    ^e    end of line
    ^d    delete next character
    ^h    delete previous character
    ^w    delete previous word
    ^k    delete to end of line
    ^u    delete to beginning of line
</pre>
<p>

If the GUI is combined with a drawing area, the drawing area and the text
area are placed in a pane widget. This provides the user a way to increase
or decrease the size of the text area.
