<h1>Command Window</h1>

There is a text window associated with the GUI for entering
commands. This window has command
line editing capabilities which includes a facility for accessing
previous commands. The functionality
is similar to that of tcsh.
See the table below for a list of the features that have
been implemented.
For more information on command history, see the
<a href="commands.html#history">history</a> command.

<h2>Control Sequence   Function</h2>
      ^p         previous command 
      ^n         next command 
      ^b         backword one character 
      ^f         forward one character 
      ^a         beginning of line 
      ^e         end of line 
      ^d         delete next character 
      ^h         delete previous character 
      ^w         delete previous word 
      ^k         delete to end of line 
      ^u         delete to beginning of line
</pre>

Also note that
if the GUI is combined with a drawing area, the drawing area and the text
area are placed in a pane widget. This provides a way to increase
or decrease the size of the text area by grabbing the pane control sash,
The control sash is the small square box which is
located above and to the right of the text window. See a picture of
the command window with the window pane partially raised in the
<a href="pictures.html#pane">Sample Displays</a> section.
