<title>XMGED - Getting Started</title>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h2>Single Display</h2>

Here is an example of starting xmged in its single window mode.  User
input is in boldface.

<p>
You should attach to the "X" interface.  Even if you are on an SGI,
"X" must be selected to get the new interface.  The code will
automatically sense that you are using an SGI and use the fast
GL graphics routines for the drawing area.
<p>
You are given the option of entering several X DISPLAY strings.
The first is where you would like the user interface to run, i.e. the
part with the buttons, menus, command window, etc.  The second prompt
(for Drawing Area 0) allows you to specify a different location for
the drawing area.  If the specified string is identical to that for
the user interface, you will get the
<a href="pictures.html#combined">combined form</a>, i.e. the drawing
area will be embedded into the user interface.  If these displays
differ, the drawing area will be placed into a
<a href="pictures.html#gui">separate</a> window (see
example below).
<p>
Finally it prompts you for an optional Drawing Area 1.  If a DISPLAY
specification is entered here xmged will open a second drawing area.
It will continue to prompt for additional drawing areas until an
empty line (return) is entered.  In this way you can open up any
number of drawing areas on any number of X servers.

<h2>Separate Drawing Area</h2>

Here is an example of starting xmged with the user interface on a
<a href="pictures.html#gui">separate</a>
machine from the drawing area.  The advantage of this
is that you can dedicate an entire display to the drawing area,
and get a large command window on the user interface machine.

When the user interface and drawing areas are to be displayed on
different X servers, it is recommended that the drawing area be made
local (i.e. on the machine running xmged) while the user interface is
made remote.  This is because bandwidth to the drawing area is much
more important than to the user interface.
<p>
In all cases of separate or multiple drawing areas, mouse input is
active in all of them, but mouse input normally required in the drawing
area, e.g. to center or resize the view, can be directed to an ``input
window'' on the user interface machine instead.  This
<a href="pictures.html#gui">input</a> window
is selected from the main menu.
