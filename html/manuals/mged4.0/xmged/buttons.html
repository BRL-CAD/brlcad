<title>XMGED - New Buttons</title>
<h1>New Buttons</h1>

<h2>SAVE EDIT</h2>
The <i>save edit</i> button allows the user, while in either the solid or
object edit state, to save all edits and remain in the respective edit state.
There is also a new command called 
<a href="commands.html#savedit">savedit</a>. Actually, the
<i>save edit</i> button is configured to call the
<i>savedit</i>
command when activated.
	
<h2><a name="alt mouse mode">ALT MOUSE MODE</a></h2>
The alternative mouse mode can be toggled on/off by pressing the
<i>alt mouse mode</i> button. This mode offers a virtual track ball style
rotation and a grab style translation. Assuming the default mouse
button bindings, while in the VIEW state,
the left button is used for a translation, the middle
button is used for rotation, and the right button is used for zoom/scale.
Zoom/scale is effected by moving the cursor vertically while pressing
the right mouse button. See the
<a href="sdef.html#def_buttons">Startup Defaults</a> section for a complete list
of the default mouse button bindings.

<h2><a name="multi views">MULTI VIEWS</a></h2>
Pressing the <a href="pictures.html#mv">multi views</a>
button toggles between displaying the
main drawing window and the multi-views window. The multi-views window
shows four different views at the same time. The default views shown are
45,45, front, left and top. All slider operations and view related commands
affect only the lower right window which shares it's view with the main
window. 

<h2><a name="swap views">SWAP VIEWS</a></h2>
The <i>swap views</i> mode can be toggled on/off by pressing the
<i>swap views</i> button. This mode is useful only when in <i>multi views</i>
mode. When in this mode, views can be swapped between the lower right window
and any of the other three. For instance, assuming the default mouse button
bindings, a left button press in any window,
except the lower right, puts that windows view into the lower right window.
A middle button press swaps that window's view with the view in the lower
right window. And a right button press puts the lower right window's view
into the window where the button press occurred. However, mouse button
presses in the lower right window continue to function unaffected by
<i>swap views</i> mode.
	
<h2>INPUT WIN</h2>
Display of the input window can be toggled by clicking the
<a href="pictures.html#gui">input win</a> button.
However, this button becomes insensitive when
the GUI is combined with a drawing area. The input window is used
to capture events (buttonpress, motion, keypress, etc.) so that
the view and objects can be manipulated remotely.

<h2>RATE BASED</h2>
The sliders, as well as the knobs, can be used in either <i>rate
based</i> or <i>positional</i> mode. In <i>rate based</i> mode, the slider/knob value
represents a rate of motion. And in <i>positional</i> mode, the slider/knob value
represents a non-rate based translation, rotation or zoom. This affords the
user another mode of control over view change and object movement.
Also, when in <i>positional</i> mode, the slider
labels for xslew, yslew and zslew change to xtran, ytran, and ztran
respectively. In either mode, the mouse is still able to manipulate the
view and object/s.

<h2>HELP</h2>
Display of the help menu can be toggled on/off by clicking the
<i>help</i> button. A list of all mged commands appears in the menu. To see
a description of a command, click on its' corresponding button.
