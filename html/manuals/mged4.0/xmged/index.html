<h1>XMGED - An X Interface to MGED</h1>
This document describes enhancements and changes made
to the
<a href="http://www.arl.army.mil/software/brlcad/">BRL-CAD</a>
MGED solid model editor.  While called
XMGED, it has been implemented primarily as a new display
manager in MGED, and as such all of the old interfaces
still operate.  Besides offering a more modern user
interface look and feel, there are also numerous new
features including command history and editing, journaling
and script files, multiple views, alternate mouse modes,
position (rather than rate) based knobs, etc.
