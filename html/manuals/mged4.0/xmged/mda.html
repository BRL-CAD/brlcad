<title>Multiple Drawing Areas</title>

<h1>Multiple Drawing Areas</h1>
Any number of drawing areas can be opened for drawing. This feature
was created in order to display copies of the drawing area on
different workstations for the purpose of training, or for collaboration
with colleagues. Input events such as buttonpress, keypress, and pointer
motion, can be captured as usual in the drawing window/s or remotely, on
the GUI display, using the
<a href="pictures.html#gui">input</a> window. The input window is active only
if the GUI is not combined with a drawing area. The GUI and drawing area
0 will be <a href="pictures.html#combined">combined</a>
if, during the initial prompting for display names, the
display name of drawing area 0 is the same as the display name of the GUI.
Otherwise, they will be <a href="pictures.html#draw">separate</a>.
If running mged on an sgi and displaying on an sgi, mged will open
a gl window for drawing, otherwise it will open an X window.
If the drawing area is an X window and the X display supports color, then
the solids will be drawn in a color that closely matches the assigned
color.
