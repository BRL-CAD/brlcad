<title>Multi-Views</title>
<h1>Multi-Views</h1>

A new mode called multi-views allows four different
views to be displayed at one time, as can be seen in the
<a href="pictures.html#mv">Sample Displays</a> section.
The default views shown are 45,45,
front, left and top. 
Multi-views mode is toggled on/off by clicking the button
labelled <i>multi views</i> in the main menu or, assuming the
default key bindings, by pressing the <i>m</i> key while in
the drawing area.

<p>
All slider operations and view related
commands entered from the command window or by making a menu selection affect
only the lower right window which shares it's view with the main window. 
The views in each of the windows, other than the lower right window, can
only be changed by using the mouse, keyboard, or dials and buttons.
If use of the command
window, menus, or sliders are desired to manipulate the view within either of
these three windows, the view can be swapped over to the lower right window.
This can be done while in
<a href="buttons.html#swap views">swap mode</a> or by using control-n or control-p to
cycle through the views.
When in the drawing window, control-n and control-p
cause the view to be changed to the next or previous view respectively, and
will work whether or not multi-views mode is active.
