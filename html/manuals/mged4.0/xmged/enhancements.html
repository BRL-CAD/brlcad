<title>XMGED - Introduction</title>
<h1>Introduction</h1>

The primary motivation to design a new graphical user interface (GUI)
for mged was to take advantage of the X toolkit (XT) and the look and
feel of the widget sets that are layered atop that. In particular, the
X display manager has been rewritten to make use of the Motif widget
set. The usual assortment of display managers are still available,
however, this document concerns itself primarily with the X display
manager. Any deviation from this will be noted. 

<p>
In addition to modernizing the GUI, many new features have also been added.
Among these are command history and editing, command aliasing, journaling
and script files, multiple views, multiple drawing windows, online documentation,
alternate mouse modes, position (in addition to rate) based knobs/sliders, viewing axes,
binding of keys and mouse buttons, support for dials and buttons, user defined
menus,  color support, etc.

<p>
Many new commands and buttons have been added. The buttons pertain only to the
X display manager, while the new commands have been designed to work with all
display managers. However, in the case where the command is inherently display
manager dependent, hooks have been provided to allow support for a particular
display manager. In commands of this type, no support has yet been added for the
other display managers, so the command simply returns. Too add support for a
particular display manager, one would need to write a new function within that
display manager, declare the appropriate hook, and initialize the hook to point
to the newly created function. One would also have to set these hooks to null
when releasing the display.

<p>
The new X display manager is more than just a replacement for the old X display
manager. It can also be considered as a replacement for the sgi display manager
because when running on an sgi, the drawing is done in gl. As with the sgi display
manager, access to the dials and buttons is also provided. Having said this, it
should be noted that the customary sgi display manager is still available.
