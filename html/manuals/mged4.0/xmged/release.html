<title>XMGED - About This Release</title>
<h1>About This Release</h1>

Source code for XMGED is included with BRL-CAD release 4.3
or later. You will need a machine with X11
and the Motif widget set.  All SGI machines come with Motif.  On
Suns and other machines this may be an extra cost option. If
there is enough interest, a version using a public domain widget
set will be developed.
