<h1>XMGED - An X Interface to MGED</h1>
This paper describes enhancements and changes made
to the
<a href="http://www.arl.army.mil/software/brlcad/">BRL-CAD</a>
MGED solid model editor.  While called
XMGED, it has been implemented primarily as a new display
manager in MGED, and as such all of the old interfaces
still operate.  Besides offering a more modern user
interface look and feel, there are also numerous new
features including command history and editing, journaling
and script files, multiple views, alternate mouse modes,
position (in addition to rate) based knobs/sliders, user definable
menus, etc.
<p>
The description contained here is for a beta release of the code.
The Motif widget set was used, so at present
you need a machine with Motif in order to compile this software
(included with all SGI's).  The software is also known to
work on Sun's under SunOS 4.x with Motif.
We encourage user feedback both for bug reports and criticism of
current features or suggestions of desired features.
