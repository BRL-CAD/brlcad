<P>
The procedure for solid editing is quite similar to that for object editing.
First, solid edit state must be entered, by pressing the
``solid illuminate'' button, or selecting the ``solid illum'' menu item.
Second,
A solid is selected for
editing using the illuminate mode, just as in object editing,
by moving the cursor up and down, and choosing the desired solid.
The solid data is listed at the top of the screen and a
header depending on the solid type is written above the solid editing data.
Third, select the appropriate function button or edit menu operations,
and perform the editing desired.  Finally, the solid
editing mode is exited
by either accepting or rejecting the editing performed.
<P>
A solid must be displayed before it can be picked for editing.
To pick a displayed solid for editing, press the ``solid illum'' button or
select ``Solid Illum'' from the ***BUTTON MENU***.
The data tablet and pen/mouse are then used to pick the solid.
The surface of the data tablet is divided into as many horizontal sections
as there are solids displayed.
The displayed solid corresponding to the horizontal section the pen/mouse
is located in will be ``illuminated'' (it will become brighter on black and
white devices and white on color devices).
The complete hierarchical path to reach the solid is also listed on the
display.  When the pen/mouse is pressed, MGED enters the solid edit state
with the illuminated solid as the solid to be edited.
If the solid is not multiply referenced, entering <em>sed solidname</em> on
the keyboard will immediately put MGED in the solid edit state with
<em>solidname</em> as the edited solid.
