<P>
The role of CAD models at BRL differs somewhat from
that of CAD models being built in the automobile and aerospace industries,
resulting in some different design choices
being made in the BRL CAD software.
Because BRL's main use for these models is to conduct detailed
performance and survivability analyses of large complex vehicles,
it is required that the model of an entire vehicle be completely contained
in a single database suitable for interrogation by the application codes.
This places especially heavy demands on the database software.
At the same time, these analysis codes require less detail
than would be required if NC machining were the primary goal.
<P>
At BRL, there are only a small number of primary designers responsible
for the design of a vehicle, and for the construction of the corresponding
solid model.  Together they decide upon and construct the
overall structure of the model,
then they perform the work of building substructures in parallel,
constantly combining intermediate results into the full model database.
Because of the need to produce rapid prototypes (often creating a full design
within a few weeks), there is no time for a separate integration stage;
subsystem integration must be an ongoing part of the design process.
<P>
Once an initial vehicle design is completed, there is usually the
need for exploring many alternatives.  Typically, between three and twelve
variations of each design need to be produced, analyzed, and optimized
before recommendations for the final design can be made.
Also, there is a constantly changing definition of performance;
new developments may necessitate rapidly re-evaluating
all the designs of the past several years for trouble spots.
<P>
The user interface is designed to be powerful and ``expert friendly'' rather
than foolproof for a novice to use.
However, it only takes about two days for new users to start doing useful
design work with MGED.
True proficiency comes with a few months practice.
<P>
Finally, it is vitally important that the software offer the same capabilities
and user interface across a wide variety of display and processor hardware.
Government procurement regulations make single-vendor solutions difficult.
The best way to combat this is with highly portable software.
