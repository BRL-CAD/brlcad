Since the MGED system is presently based on the COMGEOM solid modeling
technique, a brief overview of the COMGEOM technique is required
to effectively use MGED.
For more detailed information on the COMGEOM technique see

<P>
The COMGEOM technique utilizes two basic entities - a solid and a region.
A solid is defined as one of fifteen basic geometric shapes or
primitives.  Figure 2.1 lists the
basic solid types, and Figure 2.2 lists
special cases of the basic solid types for which support exists.
The individual parameters of each solid define the solid's
location, size, and orientation.  A region is a combination of  
one or more solids and is defined as the volume occupied 
by the resulting combination of solids.
Solids are combined into regions using any of three logic
operations: union (OR), intersection (+), or difference (-).
The union of two solids is defined as the volume in either
of the solids.
The difference of two solids is defined as the volume of the first
solid minus the volume of the second solid.
The intersection of two solids is defined as the volume 
common to both solids.
<P>
Any number of solids may be combined to produce a region.
As far as the COMGEOM technique is concerned, only a region can
represent an actual component of the model.
Regions are homogeneous;  they are composed of a single material.
Each region represents a single object in the model;
the solids are only building blocks which are combined to
define the <em>shape</em> of the regions.
Since regions represent the components of the model, they
are further identified by code numbers.
These code numbers either identify the region as
a model component (nonzero item code)
or as air (nonzero air code).
Any volume not defined as a region is assumed to be ``universal air'' and
is given an air code of ``01''.
If it is necessary to distinguish between universal ``01'' air and any
other kind of air, then that volume must be defined as a region
and given an air code other than ``01''.
Normally, regions cannot occupy the same volume (overlap),
but regions identified with
air codes can overlap with any region identified as a component
(i.e. one that has a nonzero item code).
Regions identified with different air codes, however, can not overlap.
