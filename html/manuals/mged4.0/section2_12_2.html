<P>
The first task is to invoke MGED.  This tutorial will assume the user
has a copy of the ``prim.g'' database in the current directory.
<P>
<tt>$</tt><em>mged prim.g</em><BR><tt>BRL-CAD Release 3.0 Graphics Editor (MGED) Compilation 82</tt><BR><tt>Thu Sep 22 08:08:39 EDT 1988</tt><BR><tt>mike@video.brl.mil:/cad/.mged.4d2</tt><BR><tt>attach (nu|tek|tek4109|ps|plot|sgi)[nu]? </tt><em>sgi</em><BR><tt>ATTACHING sgi (SGI 4d)</tt><BR><tt>Primitive Objects (units=mm)</tt><BR><tt>mged&gt; </tt><BR>The first three lines give information about which version of MGED is running,
when it was compiled, and who compiled it.  The next line is the display
manager attach prompt.  This prompt provides a list of available display
managers, then shows what the default will be (selected if the user answers
with a carriage return).  In this case, the Silicon Graphics 4d display
manager was selected, as is noted by the following line.
Next the title of the database and
the unit of measurement used in the database are printed, 
and finally, the first prompt is issued.
At this point MGED has loaded ``prim.g''; attached the SGI display;
and is awaiting commands.  Attaching a display also causes what
is known as the MGED <i>faceplate</i> to be drawn on the graphics display.
<P>
The faceplate has several features of interest.  In the upper left corner
of the display, is a box which always shows the current MGED <i>state</i>.
This can be one of six states:  <b>VIEWING</b>, <b>SOL PICK</b>,
<b>SOL EDIT</b>, <b>OBJ PICK</b>, <b>OBJ PATH</b>, or <b>OBJ EDIT</b>.
<P>
Immediately below, is the menu area.  The only menu item initially shown is
one labeled <b>BUTTON MENU</b>.  This menu item toggles the display of the
button menu entries when <i>selected</i> (more on selection later).
<P>
At the bottom of the display are two status lines.  The first line
contains information about the current view.
The entry labeled <b>cent=</b> gives the <i>model space</i> coordinates 
of the dot in the center of the display.
The entry labeled <b>sz=</b> reflects the current size in model units of
the <i>viewing cube</i>.  The viewing cube is a mathematical construct
centered on the the dot in the center of the display.  The <b>ang=</b>
display shows the current rate of rotation in each of the three axes.
The bottom line is used for several kinds of information.
In the <b>VIEWING</b> state, it displays the title of the database.
<P>
The MGED viewing features are designed to allow the user to examine
models at different angles.
Preset views can be invoked at 
anytime by using either the menu or the button box.
Selecting a preset view does
not change the coordinates of the primitives,
but instead changes the angle from which these primitives are
displayed.  Five standard views (top, right, front, 35/25, and 45/45) can 
be obtained by using either the bottom menu on the display screen or the 
control box.
Three additional views (button, left, and rear) can be obtained
by using the button box, but not by using the menu.
<P>
The normal or default viewing state is the ``top'' orientation,
with model +X pointing towards the right of the screen,
model +Y pointing towards the top of the screen,
and model +Z pointing out of the screen.
In the ``top'' view, the model and screen axes are the same.
The ``reset'' button and ``Reset Viewsize'' menu items also
result in a ``top'' view.
<P>
The following table shows the angles of rotation to obtain the other views.
<P>
View                Angle of Rotation (from top) <BR><BR>Top                           0, 0, 0 <BR>Bottom                      180, 0, 0 <BR>Right                       270, 0, 0 <BR>Left                       270, 0, 180 <BR>Front                      270, 0, 270 <BR>Rear                       270, 0, 90 <BR>35, 25                     295, 0, 235 <BR><tt>mged&gt; </tt><em>e arb8</em><BR><tt>vectorized in 0 sec</tt><BR><tt>mged&gt; </tt><em>size 12</em><BR><tt>mged&gt; </tt><BR><A NAME=t1-top-vw HREF="t1-top-vwbig.gif"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="t1-top-vw.gif"></A>

<P>
The <b>e</b> command causes the named object(s) - a solid named ``arb8'' 
in this case
- to be displayed, and the <b>size</b> command sets the size of the
viewing cube. 
	<A HREF="t1-top-vwbig.gif">Figure (t1-top-vw)</A>
 shows what the display currently
looks like.  In this view, the X-axis is to the right, the Y-axis points
up, and the Z-axis is perpendicular to (poking out of) the screen.
<P>
<em>Twist the <b>Y ROT</b> knob clockwise and back.</em><BR><em>Twist the <b>X ROT</b> knob counterclockwise and back.</em><BR>These knobs, along with the <b>Z ROT</b> knob, rotate the viewing cube.
Use of the rotation
knobs allows the user to view the model from any orientation.
Turning a knob clockwise causes a rotation in the positive direction,
while turning a knob counterclockwise causes a negative rotation
(right-hand rule).  The knobs are rate based, not position based;
once a rotation has been started, it will continue until the
knob is returned to zero (or the <b>zeroknobs</b> button is pressed).
Rotations are about the viewing cube (screen) axes, not the model axes.
Systems without knobs can use the <b>knob</b> command.
<P>
<em>Move the mouse (or pen) until the cursor is in the <b>BUTTON MENU</b>
block and then press the middle mouse button (depress the pen).</em><BR><A NAME=t1-rot-vw HREF="t1-rot-vwbig.gif"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="t1-rot-vw.gif"></A>
	<A HREF="t1-rot-vwbig.gif">Figure (t1-rot-vw): ``arb8'' Rotated View</A>
<P>
Pressing the middle mouse button (or the pen) <i>selects</i> something.
When the cursor is inside the menu area, a selection
causes the event described by the menu item to occur.
Selecting <b>BUTTON MENU</b> causes the button menu to appear on the left
side of the screen. The <b>BUTTON MENU</b> menu item is
a toggle; subsequent selection of this item will cause the button menu
to disappear. 
	<A HREF="t1-rot-vwbig.gif">Figure (t1-rot-vw)</A>
 shows the new display.
<P>
<em>Move the cursor from the menu area to a point near the
upper left corner of the solid and select it (press the center mouse
button).</em><BR>In the <b>VIEWING</b> state, making a selection while outside of the menu
area will move the selected point to the center of the display.  Look
carefully at the center of the display; the point just selected is now
located at the center dot. Use the <b>center</b> command to reset any
translations made with the mouse.
<P>
<tt>mged&gt; </tt><em>center 0 0 0</em><BR><tt>mged&gt; </tt><BR>From the <b>VIEWING</b> state, the user will normally transition to either the
<b>SOL PICK</b> or <b>OBJ PICK</b> state.
The <b>SOL PICK</b> state is selected by:
<UL><LI> Selecting the <b>Solid Illum</b> button menu entry, or,
<LI> Pressing the <b>sill</b> button (this button may be labeled
using some variation of ``Solid Illum''), or,
<LI> Typing <b>press sill</b>.
</UL>Similar entries (<b>Object Illum</b>) and (<b>oill</b>) exist for transitioning
into the <b>OBJ PICK</b> state.
In general, the <b>press</b> command is the basic mechanism (type
<b>press help</b> for a list of available commands).  Most of the press
commands have been mapped onto a button box if it is available,
 and some of the
most common are also mapped into the <b>BUTTON MENU</b> so they can
accessed without letting go of the mouse.
