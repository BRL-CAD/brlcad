	Megatek Buttons</TT></PRE>
<P>
The Megatek button box
is a general purpose input/output device that communicates with
MGED through an intelligent control unit.  The device has eight
rotatable knobs and 16 buttons with lights.
The ``buttons'' and ``knobs'' of the Megateks are located in the same box.
There are not enough buttons to have just one assigned meaning, hence
most buttons have dual functions.
To toggle the functions of the buttons,
use the upper right button (toggle button).
When the light on this button is ON, the functions listed on the RIGHT above
each button is the current function.
When the light on the ``toggle'' button is OFF, the functions labeled on the
LEFT are then in effect.
The left/right meaning of these buttons is grouped generally according to
viewing functions on the left and editing functions on the right.
<P>
The table above summarizes the uses of the buttons.
Depressing the button switches the light on and off.  Many of these serve a
dual role depending upon the selected mode - viewing or editing.  The mode is
selected by depressing button 4.  If light 4 is off, the system is performing
in the viewing mode, and the commands shown in the top half of the table are
executed.  If light 4 is on, the system is performing in the edit mode, and
the commands shown in the bottom half are executed.
