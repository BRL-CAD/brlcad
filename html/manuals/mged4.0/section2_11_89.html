The MGED editor includes a number of features which are useful
for developing animation tools and scripts.
The full description of the current viewing transformation and eye position
can be saved in a file,
and such a previously saved view can be read back at any time,
immediately changing the editor's view.
In addition, the current viewing transformation and eye position can be
appended to a file containing a collection of keyframes.
Most importantly, a file full of keyframe information, either raw keyframe
positions or smoothly interpolated keyframe sequences, can 
by ``played'' in real time using MGED,
providing a powerful and fast animation preview capability.
<P>
As a separate animation capability intended
for developing demonstrations and instructional material relating to the
use of the MGED editor,
all user interactions with the editor can be recorded in a file,
along with an indication of the time elapsed between user actions.
This file can be  adjusted using a normal text editor to remove any errors,
or to eliminate dead time where the user stopped to think.
Once created, this session script can be replayed through the editor
at any time, either to provide a smooth ``canned'' demonstration
before a live audience, or to create a film or videotape.
