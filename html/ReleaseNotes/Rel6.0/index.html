<dl>
<dt><b>New Database File Format</b>
<dd>This is probably the most significant change in this release.
It introduces a large number of new capabilities in BRLCAD.
The significant features this introduces include:
    <dl>
	<dt><b>Machine-independent data</b></dt>
	<dd>The geometry in the new file format is stored in an 
	architecture-independent fashion.  This removes the need to convert
	the geometry file to ASCII representation and back to binary when 
	moving between machines of different architectures (e.g. between 
	Big-Endian/Little-Endian machines).</dd>

	<dt><b>Unlimited Length Object Names</b></dt>
	<dd>Names of objects in the geometry database were previously limited
	to 16 characters.  This restriction was burdensome when constructing
	complex systems.  The new database format (and MGED/rt) allows for
	unlimited length names for objects.  The only limits remaining are 
	usability/human factors (you may wish to think twice before using 
	1024-character names for all your objects).</dd>

	<dt><b>Object Attributes</b></dt>
	<dd>All geometry file objects can now carry arbitrary text data.
	This is stored as a series of name/value pairs.  For example, it is
	possible to store an attribute called "modeler" which could indicate
	the name and organization of the person who created that portion of 
	the geometry.  Another attribute might be "density" whose value would
	be the density of the material from which the object was constructed.
	Analysis codes can store application specific data in these attributes
	and retrieve them at run-time.  MGED has a GUI control panel for 
	creating and editing object attributes.</dd>

	<dt><b>Opaque Binary Objects</b></dt>
	<dd>It is now possible to store arbitrary data in a BRLCAD geometry 
	database object.  For example, the entire description from an
	external CAD system could be stored for reference.  Several features
	of BRLCAD geometry which require ancillary data can now use these
	database objects as a data source in addition to being able to use
	external disk files.</dd>

	<dt><b>Reduced Disk space requirements</b></dt>
	<dd>The new file format is more aggressive about space utilization.
	Many primitives now occupy significantly less disk space.</dd>
	
	<dt><b>New <i>dbupgrade</i> utility for easy migration</b></dt>
	<dd>The dbupgrade command has been created to bring old 
	databases up to the most current version of the file format.</dd>

	<dt><b>Dual Format capability</b></dt>
	<dd>The BRLCAD utilities retain the ability to work with files
	in the previous format.  Users can upgrade geometry to the new format
	when they choose.  However, new features implemented in the geometry
	file may not be available under the old format.</dd>

	<dt><b>Hidden Objects</b></dt>
	<dd>It is now possible to mark objects in the database as "hidden".
	These will not be listed in ordinary displays of database content.
	This allows users to keep objects such as Opaque Binary Objects from
	cluttering listings.</dd>

	<dt><b>Deprecation of obsolete "hf" primitive</b></dt>
	<dd>The dsp primitive (Displacement Map) is functionally equivalent
	and offers substantial performance advantages.  The bot primitive 
	(Bag 'o Triangles) is a likewise a substantial improvement over the 
	existing "poly" primitive.  The dbupgrade utility converts existing 
	hf and poly primitives into dsp and bot primitives, respectively.  
	Both hf and poly primitives are deprecated.</dd>

	<dt><b>Introduction of 2D "sketch" primitive</b></dt>
	<dd>The sketch primitive consists of straight lines, circular arcs, 
	and bezier curves.  There is a drawing utility in MGED for creating
	them.</dd>

	<dt><b>Introduction of "extrude" primitive</b></dt>
	<dd>The extrude primitive supports linear extrusion of 
	closed-boundary sketch primitive drawings to create 3D objects.
	</dd>

	<dt><b>New ASCII file format for new binary file format</b></dt>
	<dd>This new ASCII format is based upon the Tcl scripting language.
	It allows more convenient processing and manipulation of the ASCII
	format.</dd>
    </dl>
</dd>
<dt><b>MGED Geometry Editor Improvements</b></dt>
<dd>In addition to supporting both the old and new geometry file formats, there
have been numerous improvements.  These include:
    <dl>
	<dt><b>New User's Manual</b></dt>
	<dd>A completely updated tutorial introduction to MGED and modeling
	with BRLCAD.  Delivered in PDF format, suitable for both online 
	browsing and printing.  Includes a complete command reference.  Look
	for it in the mged menus at:<br>"Help->Manual->PDF MGED Tutorial"<or>or<br>
	"/usr/brlcad/html/manuals/mged/VolumeII-Introduction_to_MGED.pdf"
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Accelerators for complex shape construction</b></dt>
	<dd>These allow user to automatically generate more complex 
	primitives from existing ones: rcc-blend, rcc-cap, rcc-tgc, 
	rpp-arch, rpp-cap, rpp-arch, tor-rcc, sph-part</dd>

	<dt><b>Improved menu and interface layout</b></dt>
	<dd></dd>

	<dt><b><i>Abort</i> on Raytrace Control Panel</b></dt>
	<dd>Users Now have the option to abort a running ray-trace process
	right from the control panel.</dd>

	<dt><b>Extended Primitive Type-in Support</b></dt>
	<dd>Several Primitive types can now be created from the command prompt.
	These include: <ul>
		<li>kinematics control (grip)</li>
		<li>and arbitrary regular</li>
		<li>polyhedron (arbn)</li>
		</ul>

	<dt><b>Extended Primitive Auto-Generation</b></dt>
	<dd>Several primitive types can now be auto-generated using the 
	<i>make</i> command from within MGED.  These include:<ul>
		<li>rectangular parallelepipeds (rpp)</li>
		<li>arbitrary faceted (ars)</li>
		<li>and arbitrary regular polyhedron (arbn)</li></ul>
	Primitives created with this command take their initial parameters
	from the view center and size.</dd>


	<dt><b>New or improved commands</b></dt>
	<dd>The following new commands have been implemented:
	<ul>
		<li><b>E</b> Extended options for creating evaluated wireframes</li>
		<li><b>adjust:</b> Alter attributes of an object.</li>
		<li><b>attr:</b> Assign or retrieve a named text attribute from an object</li>

		<li><b>bot_decimate:</b> Perform facet reduction on BOT by edge collapse</li>

		<li><b>nmg_collapse:</b> Perform facet reduction on NMG by edge collapse</li>
		<li><b>nmg_simplify:</b> Attempt to convert NMG to CSG primitive (ARB, TGC)</li>

		<li><b>summary</b> Provide database statistics</li>
		<li><b>xpush</b> An extended push that attempts to avoid degenerate conditions in matrix propagation.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Build Pattern Tool</b></dt>
	<dd>This tool facilitates the construction of replicated objects
	in various rectangular grid and circular patterns.  For example: 
	lines of rivet heads, bolt holes, railroad ties, tire tread patterns.
