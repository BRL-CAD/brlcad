 *  This header file is intended to be #include'ed in front of any
 *  loop which is known to never involve more than 32,
 *  to permit vectorizing compilers to omit extra overhead.
 *
 *  Vector register file lengths:
 *	Alliant		32
 *	Cray XMP	64
 *	Cray 2		64
 *	Convex		128
 *	ETA-10		Unlimited
 *
 *  This file contains various definitions which can be safely seen
 *  by both ANSI and non-ANSI compilers and preprocessors.
 *  Absolutely NO #pragma's can go in this file;  they spoil backwards
 *  compatability with non-ANSI compilers.
 *  If this file determines that it is being processed by an ANSI
 *  compiler, or one that is known to accept #pragma, then it will #include
 *  the file "noalias-prag.h", which will contain the various
 *  vendor-specific #pragma's.
