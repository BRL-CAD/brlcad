.TH TANKILL-G 1 BRL-CAD
.SH NAME
tankill-g \- TANKILL Translator (TANKILL to BRL-CAD)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tankill-g
[-p] [-t tolerance] [-i input_tankill_file] [-o database.g]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I tankill-g\^
converts the specified
.I input_tankill_file
to a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file. The
.I tolerance
provided is the maximum distance (in mm) between two
vertices at which they will be considered to be the same vertex. The
.I -p
option provides output in the form of polysolids rather than the
default which is NMG objects. The
.I input_tankill_file
is expected to be in the
.I TANKILL
format used by the British Defense Research Agency. This is
a simple triangular patch format where each object is described
by a series of vertices. Triangular facets are built from the first,
second, and third vertices; from the second, third, and fourth vertices;
from the third, fourth and fifth; and so on. Each object is converted
to a single NMG object which is then placed into its own region and
assigned the component code provided in the TANKILL file.
