.TH DXF-G 1 BRL-CAD
.SH NAME
dxf-g \- DXF Translator (DXF to BRL-CAD)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dxf-g
[-d] [-v] [-t tolerance] file.dxf database.g
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dxf-g\^
converts the specified
.I file.dxf
to a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file.
The
.I -d
option sets a debug flag. The only effect is to cause a core dump on failure.
This is probably not useful except for developers.
The
.I -v
option produces very verbose output on stderr.
The
.I -t
option specifies the maximum distance (in mm) between two vertices at which the two vertices
will be considered to be the same vertex.
The
.I file.dxf
file is expected to be in the Autodesk DXF format as defined in the
Autocad 2000 manuals. This converter handles entities of type POLYLINE, VERTEX, LINE, CIRCLE, ARC, and 3DFACE.
The POLYLINE entities in AUTOCAD are actually a container for numerous different entity types. The types
of POLYLINE entities converted include 3D polylines, 3D polygon meshes, and polyface meshes.
Each layer is converted to a seperate opbject. Colors are also converted.
