2002-09-09  Chad Smith  <csmith@adc.com>
    * Makefile.in: SF ticket 227921
	Updated man page installation such that "iwidgets_" is now
	prepended to the man page filename.  This is done to avoid
	naming conflicts with man pages in other extensions.

2002-09-08  Marty Backe <marty@lucidway.org>

2002-09-06  Chad Smith  <csmith@adc.com>
    * generic/hierarchy.itk: SF ticket 596111
	After reconfiguring -querycommand, the text component

	the hilite, lowlite, and info tags.

2002-09-05  Chad Smith  <csmith@adc.com>
    * generic/hierarchy.itk: SF ticket 600941

    * generic/tabnotebook.itk: SF ticket 514222
	Patch added for infinite loop problem introduced by
	new -padx and -pady Tk frame widget options in 8.4

2002-09-05  Chad Smith  <csmith@adc.com>
    * generic/tabnotebook.itk: SF ticket 603823
	Patch for bugs related to the -int option
    * generic/calendar.itk: SF ticket 603823
	Found bug while testing the dateentry patch.  Several
	methods expected -int to be set to "yes" or "no"

2002-03-24  Marty Backe <mgbacke@usa.net>
    * generic/disjointlistbox.itk
        Applied patch sumitted by Brett Schwarz to add two new sort
        options which determine how items are added to each
        scrolledlistbox. Did some various code formatting cleanup.
    * doc/disjointlistbox.n
        Updated the man page to reflect the addition of the two
        sort options.
    * demos/html/disjointlistbox.n.html
        Updated the html version of the man page
    * tests/disjointlistbox.test
        Added tests for the the two new options. 

2002-03-19  Marty Backe <mgbacke@usa.net>
    * generic/messagebox.itk
        Modified the save method to center the tk_getSaveFile dialog
        on the messagebox window.

2002-03-16  Marty Backe <mgbacke@usa.net>
    * generic/scrolledlistbox.itk: SF Patch 494696
        Applied patch submitted by Brett Schwarz to change the sort
        method to accept any sort arguments allowed by Tcl's lsort.
        Modified patch to generate an appropriate error message if an
        invalid sort argument is provided.
    * doc/scrolledlistbox.n
        Updated the man page to reflect the new sort arguments.
    * demos/html/scrolledlistbox.n.html
        Updated per change to doc/scrolledlistbox.n
    * tests/scrolledlistbox.test
        Updated the 'fail test' to reflect the new error message generated
        by an invalid sort argument.
    * tests/combobox.test
        Updated the sort 'failed test' to reflect the new error message
        generated by an invalid sort argument. Fallout from patch to
        scrolledlistbox.itk. See above.

2002-03-15  Marty Backe <mgbacke@usa.net>
    * generic/messagebox.itk
        Fixed a couple of bugs relating to the popup menu 'Save' function:
            1) The filename that was saved to was also echoed to the
               messagebox. Unfortunately the variable referenced was not
               valid, so a stack trace followed any Save operation.
            2) The message 'issued' to the messagebox from item 1) above
               used the tag INFO, which doesn't exist by default.

            I choose to remove the 'issue' after a file Save. The widget
            really shouldn't contribute anything to the messagebox output.
            The user of the messagebox iwidget should have control over
            what gets displayed.

        Changed the 'export' method to directly use the scrolledtext
        'export' method instead of re-implementing it within this widget.

        Rearranged the layout of the popup menu. Moved the 'Clear' menu
        to the end of the list. It was too easy to generate the popup and
        accidentally choose the 'Clear' function.
    
    * generic/hyperhelp.itk
        Removed the 'error' statement that would cause any application that
        used Hyperhelp to stacktrace if a file to be rendered couldn't be
        opened. It's now just a silent error. Perhaps a -errorcommand option
        could be added later.

2002-03-10  Marty Backe <mgbacke@usa.net>
    * generic/extfileselectionbox.itk: SF ticket 482080
        Fixed SF ticket 482080 - wrapped _pwd in quotes
        Fixed newly discovered bug:
            When the current directory contains a directory named after
            a punctuation mark (e.g., ! '). Method _setDirList was always
            setting the Dir listbox selection to index 0, which is normally
            ".", unless the directory contains a directory named
            after a punctuation mark. Now it gets set to "." regardless.

2002-02-26  Marty Backe <mgbacke@usa.net>
    * generic/radiobox.itk: SF ticket 521332
        Fixed various bugs:
            1) Traces weren't being released when the object was destroyed.
            2) Small memory leak - _modes($this) array element not deleted
               when the object was destroyed.
            3) If the -command option was defined, the command would be
               triggered when the first radiobutton was added via the add
               method.
        Added a destructor to fix bugs 1 & 2. Modified the constructor to
        fix bug 3.
    * generic/extfileselectiondialog.itk: SF ticket 521335
        Added the -sashcursor option (was already defined in the man page,
        but wasn't implemented).
    * tests/radiobox.test:
        Added test to check for bug number 3 above.
    * tests/extfileselectiondialog.test:
        Added 2 option tests for -sashcursor & -labelfont. Updated the
        option count test.

2002-02-24  Marty Backe <mgbacke@usa.net>
    * generic/datefield.itk
        Fixed bugs introduced in previous patch - unbraced 'if' conditionals
    * generic/tabset.itk
        Fixed bug introduced in previous patch - 'code' used instead
        of 'itcl::code'.
    * generic/shell.itk: SF ticket 521338
        The 'center' method now properly centers windows that have been
        resized between calls to center.
    * generic/scrolledlistbox.ikt: SF ticket 521326
        The <B1-Motion> binding was removed to eliminate multiple triggers
        of the command specified by the -selectioncommand option if the
        mouse is moved while the item is being selected. 
        
2002-02-16  Marty Backe <mgbacke@usa.net>
    * generic/scrolledhtml.itk: SF ticket 481956
        Fixed potential for lengthy page renderings to throw a bgerror.
        
2001-12-11  Chad Smith  <csmith@adc.com>

2001-11-29  Chad Smith  <csmith@adc.com>
	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in: SF tickets 462528 and 486735
		Removed a lot of unnecessary variables.  Updated configure.in
		so that autoconf-generated version matches the configure script
		that is included (thanks Andreas).  Removed --with-itk and
		changed --with-itcl to be required if Iwidgets is not
		installed direcly underneath toplevel Itcl directory.

2001-09-20  Chad Smith  <csmith@adc.com>
	* generic/shell.itk: SF ticket 227885
		Added an 'update idletasks' to flush the event loop after
		activating a shell iwidgets.

2001-09-18  Chad Smith  <csmith@adc.com>
	* generic/radiobox.itk: SF ticket 227923
		Added code to keep users from modifying -variable and -value
		radiobutton component options.

2001-09-17  Chad Smith  <csmith@adc.com>
	* generic/entryfield.itk: SF ticket 227912
		Corrected some pasting problems.

2001-09-14  Chad Smith  <csmith@adc.com>
	* generic/tabset.itk: SF ticket 460879
		Commented out a line of code to keep the tab from forcing
		focus on the hull frame on <Enter>.

2001-09-14  Chad Smith  <csmith@adc.com>
	* generic/tabnotebook.itk: SF tickets 452803 and 461471
		Had to do an "undo" of some previous code that was causing an
		infinite resizing on <Configure> events.

	* generic/menubar.itk:
		Fixed stack trace that would occur if the programmer attempted to create two menu items with the
		same command name.

2000-12-19  smithc
	* generic/combobox.itk:
		Fixed 3 bugs:
		
		1) bug with -state config option

		3) added code to restore grabs following dropdown listbox unmap

2000-12-06  smithc
	* generic/hierarchy.itk:
		Added patches submitted by Martin Backe on 12/5/00.  One was for a memory leak in
		the clear() method, and the other was to correct %n substitution in the _select()
		method.

	* doc/hierarchy.n:
		Added -selectcommand to the man page.

2000-08-25  csmith
	* generic/scrolledlistbox.itk:
		Patch submitted by Shaun Lowry - I don't know the ticket number, but here's
		part of the ticket description:
		
		Name:  Shaun Lowry
		email:  slowry@iss.net
		Support:  Gold
		Severity:  2
		OperatingSystem:  Windows NT
		OperatingSystemVersion:  NT4 SP6
		Machine:  Beige :-) (home built PC)
		Synopsis:  scrolledlistbox "pattern" based selection doesn't work properly
		
		ReproducibleScript:
		package require Iwidgets
		iwidgets::scrolledlistbox .f
		.f insert end "friendly"
		.f insert end "hostile"
		.f get host*
		.f get friend*

2000-08-22  welch
	* configure:
	* configure.in:
		Bumped version number to 3.0.1 (PARTS LIST NOTICE)

	* generic/scrolledlistbox.itk:
		Added catch around -listvariable option so this can be used
		with older versions of Tk that do not have this option on listboxes.

2000-08-17  csmith
	* generic/timeentry.itk:
		Same problem as dateentry.  See documentation for dateentry version 1.2 in
		CVS.  I don't have a ticket number.
		
		-chad smith

	* generic/dateentry.itk:
		While documenting the iwidgets last year in my book, I came across a bug where
		destroying a component didn't remove it from the composite options list.  I
		told Michael about it, and he's fixed it in 3.2.  This broke the dateentry
		because it was explicitly unsetting the component from the itk_component
		array.  I simply deleted that line of code.
		
		I need to make a pass at the rest of the iwidgets to see which other ones were
		also unsetting the component.
		
		-chad smith

2000-08-08  csmith
	* generic/hierarchy.itk:
		Several enhancements and bug fixes added by Doug Howard.  Doug added the
		following configuration options:
			-dblclickcommand
			-icondblcommand
			-imagecommand
			-imagedblcommand
			-imagemenuloadcommand
			-textmenuloadcommand
		
		He also added two public methods: expanded and expState.  Multiple non-public
		methods were added to support the new configuration options.  I have updated
		the man page for each new option and public method.

	* doc/hierarchy.n:
		Man page updated per the additional configuration options and public methods
		added by Doug Howard.

	* tests/hierarchy.test:
		Needed to change the number of configuration options per additions by
		Doug Howard so hierarchy would pass the 'make test'.

		6/26/00 (bug fix)
		  Fixed Itcl_ClassVarResolver so that the formal parameters in a
		  method/proc take precedence over class data members.
		
		6/30/00 (bug fix)
		  Fixed all itcl/itk/iwidgets3.0.0 tests to run cleanly with the new
		  tcltest package.
		
		7/1/00 (bug fix)
		  Fixed "itk_component delete" so that the composite option list is
		  cleaned up whenever a component is deleted.  For example, suppose
		  a component is the sole contributor of -font.  When that component
		  is removed via "itk_component delete", the -font option goes away
		  as well.  Also fixed the handling of the itk-delete-* binding for
		  the component.  When the component is removed, the binding tag
		  is also removed by itk::remove_destroy_hook.
		
		7/5/00 (bug fix)
		  Fixed the check done during object creation to avoid clobbering
		  existing commands.  Previously, itcl would look for any command--
		  in the local *and* global namespace--that might be clobbered.
		  Now, it looks for commands only in the local namespace, since
		  those are the only ones that could truly be clobbered.
		
		7/5/00 (cleanup)
		  Removed obsolete Makefile/configure files in the various "unix"
		  directories.  Makefiles and configure files now reside one level
		  above, in the standard TEA place.

		From a patch I received from Brett Schwarz:
		
		BUG
		---
		When the -fileson option is set to false, then only the directory
		listing is shown. It is implied that this becomes a directory selector.
		However, when single clicking on a directory, the selection entry widget
		only gets updated with the tail of the directory name (what is actually
		in the directory listbox), not the whole path.
		
		DESIRED BEHAVIOR

	* generic/checkbox.itk:
		Added a new config option to the checkbox: -oritent, which allows the user to
		specify the orientation of the checkbuttons, either horizontally or
		vertically (default).

	* doc/radiobox.n:
		Updated man page to reflect the new config option I added:

2000-03-09  csmith
	* doc/scrolledlistbox.n:
		Updated man page to include -listvariable associated option and itemconfigure
		associated method.

	* generic/spinint.itk:
		Added patch submitted by Brett Schwarz.  When a value outside the specified
		range is typed into the entryfield component, the spinint will beep if the up
		or down arrow is pressed.  We decided it was better to change the value back
		to within the valid range. For example, if the range is from 10 to 20:
			user types 50 in entryfield:
				up arrow results in 10
				down arrow results in 20
			user types 5 in entryfield:
				up arrow results in 10
				down arrow results in 20

	* generic/feedback.itk:
		This is to close ticket #2881.  While implementing the fix, I found another
		bug where resizing of the window did not update the trough.  So I did not add
		the patch from this ticket.  Rather, I added a new binding in the class
		constructor on the hull such that <Configure> events invoke the _display
		method to update the trough.  This binding fixes both cases and does not
		introduce any performance problems.

	* doc/scrolledtext.n:
		Updated man page to include image associated method.

		widget's new image function per request.

	* unix/Makefile.in:

		This mega-widget is setting tk_strictMotif to 1.  Several emails circulated
		around the itcl mailing list about problems that this caused.  disjointlistbox

		line of code that did this.  After a brief sanity check, things look fine
		without this line of code.

	* generic/timefield.itk:

		Modified the 'select' method to check for a bad index value - did not use
		the patch attached to the bug report.

	* generic/canvasprintbox.itk:

	* generic/calendar.itk:

		Schwarz.

	* generic/finddialog.itk:

	* generic/extfileselectionbox.itk:
		A few public methods should be private:
			_selectDir
			_dblSelectDir
			_selectFile

	* Makefile.in:
		Patch submitted by Andreas Gustafsson: 'make clean' removes files generated
		by the configure script and should only remove files generated by make.

1999-12-20  csmith
	* generic/labeledframe.itk:
		Fixed some access level inconsistencies with some class methods.  One public
		method (smt) should not be public.  Actually, I can't find anywhere in any
		code where this method is called.  Maybe it should be deleted?  I made it
		protected along with 3 private methods that were labeled as protected in the
		method comment block.

	* generic/checkbox.itk:
		1) I removed the following configuration option definitions from the
		   class definition: -command, -disabledforeground, and -selectcolor.
		   These options are now only applicable after checkbuttons have been
		   added to the checkbox.
		
			a) The -command option never worked anyway.  It was defined
			   via 'itk_option define' but was not implemented.  The easiest
			   solution was to keep this option when adding a new checkbutton.
			   This at least adds -command functionality but doesn't provide
			   for % variable substitutions, which would be a nice addition
			   for future revisions.
		
			b) The -disabledforeground and -selectcolor options were valid
			   options for initial checkbox creation but had no error checking.
			   You could therefore create a new checkbox with -selectcolor set
			   to "foo bar" and it would work OK.  When you tried to add a new
			   checkbutton via the add() method, however, it would fail until
			   the class level -selectcolor was modified.  This could lead to
			   confusion, so these two options are now only valid after (or
			   during) the addition of checkbuttons.  Tk then handles the error
			   checking.
		
		2) Added -state to the keep fragment during checkbutton addition.
		
		So in a nutshell, these 4 options are now valid checkbox options after
		at least one checkbutton has been added:
			-command
			-disabledforeground
			-selectcolor
			-state

	* generic/toolbar.itk:
		This fix is contributed by Raviv Gil.  Below is his description of the bug.
		
		"Working with iwidgets3.0.0 we've encountered the following problem :
		We created a toolbar containing several buttons, each button with a short
		help string. Passing above the toolbar and then closing the window sometimes
		opened a Tcl Error message indicating that the method 'showBalloon' was
		invoked for an invalid tk path."

	* generic/panedwindow.itk:
		There were several places in the code that looped from 1 to the number of
		actual panes in the panedwindow when the code should be looping over the
		number of active panes.  Each of these areas in the code could cause a stack
		dump, complaining about an invalid pathanme regarding a sash or a separator.
		I've changed each of these areas to use _activePanes instead of _panes.

	* unix/configure.in:
		Fix the makefile and configure files, etc., for Unix
		in order to compile with Tcl/Tk 8.1 with stubs.
		
		Builds itclsh and itkwish properly.

1999-03-30  csmith
	* generic/checkbox.itk:
		::Checkbox::select invokes the specified checkbutton regardless of whether
		it's selected or not.  It should only tell the checkbutton to invoke if
		the checkbutton is not already selected.

	* generic/menubar.itk:
		There was a typo in the redefinition of the tkMenuFind proc at the bottom
		of menubar.itk.  "winfo" was being used instead of "info" with the
		"command" argument.

1999-03-15  csmith
	* tests/entryfield.test:
		Added one line of code in the 'foreach test' loop for the new -
		pasting option.

	* doc/entryfield.n:
		Updated man page to document a new option, -pasting, which allows the
		developer to disable pasting into the entry component of the entryfield.
		This is useful when using -validate because validation does not catch
		pasting text.

	* generic/entryfield.itk:
		1) Added a new configuration option, -pasting, which allows the user to
		   disable pasting text into the entry component of the entryfield.
		   Previously, when using -validate, the user was allowed to paste text
		   which could cause stack dumps into the entryfield because pasting was
		   not caught.  The user, for instance, could paste a 40 digit number and
		   kill any expr's since the integer is too large for tcl to handle.
		2) The _keyPress method hardcoded state comparisons for <Ctrl>, <Alt>,
		   <NumLock><Ctrl>, and <NumLock><Alt>.  The problem was that these
		   hardcoded values were UNIX-specific.  I added platform-independant code.

	* CHANGES:
		Added to entries under the Entryfield section: 1) documented new configuration
		option, -pasting; and 2) documented change to _keyPress method to remove
		hardcoded state comparisons.

1999-03-08  csmith
	* generic/panedwindow.itk:
		Instantiating an extfileselectionbox iwidgets with a single configuration
		option, '-fileson 0', caused a stack dump as a result of accessing an
		invalid tk window pathname in iwidgets::Panedwindow::sashcursor.  The
		solution was to wrap a conditional around the path to see if it exists
		before trying to use it.

1999-03-04  csmith
	* generic/combobox.itk:
		The -command configuration option was being overwritten in the
		_createComponents method if it was specified during widget creation.

1999-02-21  rjohnson
	* generic/scrolledhtml.itk:
		
		Removed stack trace error in widget.  However, the widget still
		doesn't display correctly...

1999-01-25  stanton
	* unix/iwidgets.tcl.in:
	* win/iwidgets.tcl:
		Changed so iwidgets.tcl does a "namespace import -force itcl::*"
		This is a hack to get around the fact that iwidgets uses "class"
		instead of "itcl::class".  The correct long term solution is to change
		all of the iwidgets code to use qualified names.

		Fixed bug in watch demo.

	* demos/catalog:
		
		Removed the mainwindow demo from the catalog demo.  It was not a well
		behaved demo and running would break the catalog demo.  [Bug ID: 508]
