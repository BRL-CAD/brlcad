*
*  This is a program will register a Unix-Plot file with its companion
*  pix file.  It is assumed that both images were ray-traced at the same
*  rotation.  A homogeneous transformation matrix is constructed from the
*  RT log files of the two images.  This matrix will permit the translation
*  and scaling of the plot file so that it can be readily overlaid onto its
*  pixel image mate.
*  
*  It is expected that the first log file given corresponds to the image
*  file to be overlaid onto the image that corresponds to the second log
*  file.  Also for the moment it is expected that the first log will
*  correspond to a Unix-Plot file, whereas the second will correspond to a
*  pixel file.  If both images where Unix-Plot files, they can be overlaid
*  by simply concatentating them: "cat file.pl file.pl >> out.pl"
*
*  The program conisists of three parts:
*	1) take view, orientation, eye_position, and size from two rt log 
*          files, and use this information to build up the registration matrix;
*	2) puts out a registration matrix and a new space command to be
*	   used by plrot in lieu of -a#, -e#, -g to rotate/transform the 
*	   UNIX_Plot file
*			and
*	3) involve pix-fb -o to do the overlaying of the actual files.
*	4) Note: two pixel files (one lo-res, one hi-res) will be registered
*	   later in a slightly different way.
