.SH NAME
rtcheck \- Make UNIX-Plot of overlaps in an \fBmged\fP model, using raytracing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rtcheck
[ options ... ]
model.g
objects ...
> overlaps.pl
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rtcheck
operates on the indicated
.I objects
in the input
.I model.g
and produces a floating point 3-D BRL-style
.IR plot (5)
format file on standard output, in the same units (mm)
as the underlying model database.
.LP
The orientation of the rays to be fired may be specified by
the
.B \-a
and
.B \-e
options, in which case the model will be autosized, and the grid
will be centered on the centroid of the model, with ray spacing
chosen to span the entire set of
.I objects.
Alternatively,
with the
.B \-M
option, a transformation matrix may be provided on standard input
which maps model-space to view-space.
In this case, the grid ranges from -1.0 <= X,Y <= +1.0 in view space,
with the size of the grid (number of rays fired) specified with the
.B \-s
option.
The
.B \-M
option is most useful when
.B rtcheck
is being automaticly invoked from within
.IR mged (1)
using the
\fIrtcheck\fR command in
.IR mged .
.LP
The following options are recognized.
.TP
.B \-s#
Number of rays to fire in X and Y directions (square grid).
Default is 512 (512x512).
.TP
.B \-r
Report unique overlaps. At the end of a view, a list of unique pairs
of overlapping regions is printed, along with a count of the number
of detected overlaps for each pair. Not all detected 
overlap combinations are necessarily listed, as the overlap
partition may mask a second overlap that is a continuation of an
already detected overlap.
.TP
.B \-a#
Select azimuth in degrees.  Used with
.B \-e
and conflicts with
.B \-M
.TP
.B \-e#
Select elevation in degrees.  Used with
.B \-a
and conflicts with
.B \-M
.TP
.B \-M
Read model2view matrix from standard input.
Conflicts with
.B \-a
and
.B \-e
.TP
.B \-P#
Specify the maximum number of processors (in a multi-processor system) to be
used for this execution.  The default is 1.
.LP
.B rtcheck
also accepts all other options that the
.IR rt (1)
program implements, such as for non-square views, perspective, etc.
.LP
The
.B rtcheck
program is a simple front-end to
.IR librt (3)
which is most useful when used from
.IR mged (1).
The output can be independently viewed using the UNIX-plot
viewers like
.IR pl-fb (1),
.IR pl-sgi (1),
.IR tplot (1),
etc

libplot3(3), librt(3), plot(5).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Numerous error conditions are possible.
Descriptive messages are printed on standard error (file descriptor 2).

.SH BUGS
Most deficiencies observed while using the
.B rtcheck
program are usually with the
.IR librt (3)
package instead.
