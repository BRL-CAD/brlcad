 *
 *  Ray Tracing program RTCHECK bottom half.
 *
 *  This module outputs overlapping partitions, no other information.
 *  The partitions are written to the output file (typically stdout)
 *  as BRL-UNIX-plot 3-D floating point lines, so that they can be
 *  processed by any tool that reads UNIX-plot.  Because the BRL UNIX
 *  plot format is defined in a machine independent way, this program
 *  can be run anywhere, and the results piped back for local viewing,
 *  for example, on a workstation.
 *
 *  ToDo: It would be nice if we could pass in (1) an overlap depth
 *  tolerance, (2) choose either region pair or solid pair grouping
 *  and (3) set the verbosity, e.g. whether to print *every* overlap
 *  or not.
