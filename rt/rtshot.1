.TH RTSHOT 1 BRL-CAD
.SH NAME
rtshot \- fire one ray at an \fBmged\fP model, for debugging
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rtshot
[ options ... ]
model.g
objects ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rtshot
fires a single ray at the indicated
.I objects
in the input
.I model.g
and produces a printed summary of the geometry that the ray passes through.
The orientation of the ray to be fired is specified by
giving any two of the three options
.B \-a
.B \-d
and
.B \-p\.
.TP
The
.B \-d
option is followed by three numbers specifying the direction vector.
.TP
The
.B \-p
option is followed by three numbers specifying the start point.
.TP
The
.B \-a
option is followed by three numbers specifying a point to be fired ``at''.
.TP
.B \-t #
specifies the number of triangles per piece for facetted primitives (currently only the BOT).
The default value is 4.
.TP
.B \-b #
specifies the threshold for breaking facetted primitives into pieces.
The default is 32.
.TP
.B \-x #
Set debug flags to (hexadecimal) number.
.TP
.B \-U #
Set use_air flag.
.TP
.B \-v "attribute_name1 [attribute_name2 ...]"
This option specifies a list of attribute names to be listed (along with
the appropriate values) for each region hit.
.TP
.B \-O # or keyword
This option indicates how overlaps should be handled. The
.I resolve
or
.I 0
argument is the default (normal BRL-CAD mode, all overlaps are resolved
and no overlaps appear in the output). The
.I rebuild_fastgen
or
.I 1
argument mimics FASTGEN4 raytracing (plate-mode overlaps appear in the output). The
.I rebuild_all
or
.I 2
argument rebuilds all overlaps that occured along the ray (all overlaps appear in the output). The
.I retain
or
.I 3
argument does not resolve any overlaps (each unique combination of
intersection extent and list of claiming regions produces a single partition).
.LP
The
.B rtshot
program is a simple front-end to
.IR librt (3)
which can be invoked directly by the user.

program are usually with the
.IR librt (3)
package instead.
