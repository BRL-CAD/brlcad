.SH NAME
rtregis \(em register overlay of a UNIX-Plot onto a rendered image.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rtregis
plot.log pix.log
> regtistration.matrix
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I rtregis
makes it easy and fast to overlay a UNIX-Plot file produced with \fBrthide\fR
or \fBrtrange\fR onto its equivalent color shaded image produced with \fBrt\fR or \fBcell-fb\fR.
.LP
.I rtregis
produces a script containing a call to \fBplrot\fR with the \fB-m\fR and \fB-S\fR parameters to
supply it with a registration matrix and a space command.  The registration
matrix is produced by \fBrtregis\fR from the
.B RT
log files for a UNIX-Plot file and a rendered shaded image file.
Both the UNIX-Plot image and the rendered shaded image must have been
ray-traced from the same orientation.  The output from 
.B rtregis
is a matrix and a space command that are to be used as input parameters
to 
.B plrot.
They may not be used together with
.B \-a, \-e, \-s, \-g
options to 
.B plrot.
Output is written to standard out unless it is redirected.
The output can often be included directly in a shell script using
grave accents.
.SH EXAMPLE
This section shows the ordinary usage of \fIrtregis\fR.  For example,

.nf
	\fIrtregis plot.log pix.log  > registration.matrix.file\fR
.fi

results in a file containing the registration matrix and alternate
space command for \fBplrot\fR.  It also contains a call to \fBplrot\fR and
can be edited to send the \fBplrot\fR output a file.

.nf
	 \fIsh registration.matrix.file > file.pl\fR
.fi

This results in a registered plot file.
.LP
Now the registered plot file can be overlaid onto the rendered shaded image:

.nf
	\fIpix-fb file.pix\fR
	\fIpl-fb -o file.pl\fR
.fi

This command pair results in the plot file being overlaid on top of 
the rendered shaded image that was in the framebuffer.
The result can then be converted to Impress or PostScript and sent
to a printer:

.nf
	\fIfb-pix | pix-bw | bw-impress (or bw-ps) | qpr\fR
.fi
