.SH NAME
rtg3 \(em raytrace a model, writing a COVART (GIFT) 3-component format
shotline file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rtg3
[ options ... ]
model.g
objects ...
> model.cov
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rtg3
operates on the indicated
.I objects
in the input
.I model.g
and produces a GIFT/COVART
shotline file with three components per line, and both
entrance and exit obliquity angles
on standard output.
The region ID field of the output
file is set to the region id of each intersected region (partition).
If the ray partition is followed by air,
the aircode for the air region (and the line-of-sight thickness of the air)
is noted on the shotline header line.
.LP
The orientation of the rays to be fired may be specified by
the
.B \-a
and
.B \-e
options, in which case the model will be autosized, and the grid
will be centered on the centroid of the model, with ray spacing
chosen to span the entire set of
.I objects.
Alternatively,
with the
.B \-M
option, a transformation matrix may be provided on standard input
which maps model-space to view-space.
In this case, the grid ranges from -1.0 <= X,Y <= +1.0 in view space,
with the size of the grid (number of rays fired) specified with
.B \-s
This option is most useful when
.B rtg3
is being invoked from a shell script created by an
.IR mged (1)
\fIsaveview\fR command.
.LP
A color vector display of ray-model intersections can be written to
.I rtg3.pl
and displayed with \fIpl_fb\fR or \fIpl_sgi\fR.
.LP
The following options are recognized.
.TP
.B \-s#
Number of rays to fire in X and Y directions (square grid).
Default is 512 (512x512).
.TP
.B \-a#
Select azimuth in degrees.  Used with
.B \-e
and conflicts with
.B \-M
.TP
.B \-e#
Select elevation in degrees.  Used with
.B \-a
and conflicts with
.B \-M
.TP
.B \-M
Read model2view matrix from standard input.
Conflicts with
.B \-a
and
.B \-e
.TP
.B \-g#
Select grid cell width.
.TP
.B \-G#
Select grid cell height.  If \fInot\fR specified, cell height equals
cell width.
.TP
.B \-U #
sets the Boolean variable
.I use_air
to the given value.
The default for
.IR rtg3 (1)
is on, ie
.BR \-U1 ,
but the effect of air regions may be disabled with
.BR \-U0 .
.TP
.B \-o
.B output.cov
specifies a named file for COVART-format output.
By default, the shotlines are written to stdout.
.TP
.B \-x#
Set librt debug flags to (hexadecimal) number.
.LP
The
.B rtg3
program is a simple front-end to
.IR librt (3)
which is most useful when used with
.IR mged (1)
and
.IR covart (1V).
.SH "FORMAT"
The generaly layout of the output format is:
.LP
Overall header line (one per run)
.LP
View header line (one per view)
.LP
Ray (shotline) header line (one per ray)
.LP
Component line (one for each three components in this ray)
.SH "SEE ALSO"
covart(1V), gift(1V), mged(1),
rt(1), rtray(1),
librt(3), plot3(5), ray(5V).

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Numerous error conditions are possible, usually due to errors in
the geometry database.
Descriptive messages are printed on standard error (file descriptor 2).

.SH BUGS
The COVART file format permits multiple views to be stored in one file.
.I Rtg3
presently can only compute a single view.
.LP
Most deficiencies observed while using the
.B rtg3
program are usually with the
.IR librt (3)
package instead.
