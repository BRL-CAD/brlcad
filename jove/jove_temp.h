/*
 * The editor uses a temporary file for files being edited, in a structure
 * similar to that of ed.
 * Lines are represented in core by a pointer into the temporary file which
 * is packed into 16 bits.  15 of these bits index the temporary file,
 * the 16'th is used by by redisplay.  The parameters below control
 * how much the 15 bits are shifted left before they index the temp file.
 * Larger shifts give more slop in the temp file but allow larger files
 * to be edited.
