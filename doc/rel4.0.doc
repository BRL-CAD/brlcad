Date: 3 Nov 89 14:36:18 GMT


I'm trying to take a CAD application which is currently maintained by
the MEDUSSA CAD system and convert it into a format which the BRL-CAD
system understands.  I'm told that MEDUSSA knows how to translate from
its own internal representation format into IGES, but apparently the
BRL-CAD system does not know how to read in a file in IGES format. I'm
new to the BRL-CAD system and to CAD systems in general, so I'm hoping
that I'm just not looking in the right place. 
	I also know people who wish to take PATRAN output and be able
to take advantage of the rendering capabilities of the BRL-CAD system,
but here again, it would seem that some sort of conversion utility
either has to be written or acquired.  
	I can't believe I'm the first person to be in this situation,
so I thought posting to the net would be a good idea before I think in
terms of developing my own utilities.  Is there another newsgroup
specifically for CAD related issues ? I rarely if ever see CAD related
questions in comp.graphics.

Thanks,

There are several levels of answer to this question.  First, questions
about the BRL-CAD Package are generally best addressed to  < CAD @ BRL.MIL >,
which is the list were users and developers of this software interact.

There is a deeper issue here that I though would be worthwhile
addressing for the whole group:  the difference between systems designed
primarily for drafting (most IGES-compatible systems), and systems
designed for full 3-D analysis.

First disclaimer: I really don't know anything detailed about the
internals of the MEDUSA system;  it may or may not have full 3-D
connectivity to connect all the surfaces into consistent solid objects.
However, once the data has been converted to IGES format, the surface
and connectivity data that is necessary to fully describe 3-D solid
objects has been lost.  (That is, unless the not-yet-standard IGES
SOLIDS extensions are used.)

It is important to note here that the BRL-CAD Package is a 3-D solid modeling
system.  One significant aspect of this is that geometry is restricted to
objects that have both an "inside" and an "outside".  For example, a single
polygon is not a solid, although 5 polygons might be cleverly positioned
to form a solid pyramid, or 6 polygons could be arranged to form a cube.

The difference is somewhat akin to the difference between the movie lot at
Universal Studios, where largely only the outsides of buildings have been
built, and an actual city, where the complete buildings have been built.

If you don't need the power of a solid modeling system (for example, if
your only interest is in rendering some externally-generated polygons),
then you may be better off with a different software package.  The
message which I am responding to didn't really indicate the intended
application.

Having said this, I can offer some practical assistance:

1)  At BRL, there is an ongoing project to build a converter between the
experimental IGES SOLIDS specification and the BRL-CAD format.  If you
are certain that your modeler can output your model in the IGES SOLIDS
format, then this may be of help to you.  (This project is currently
hampered by not having any serious model in IGES SOLIDS format to test
with, since BRL does not use IGES).  Contact <sue@brl.mil> and <earl@brl.mil>
for more information.

2)  There is a powerful and easy to use interface for creating BRL-CAD
geometry from within a program;  we call it LIBWDB, the library for
writing databases.  It is this library that we use for all our current
converter programs.  Thus, if you wish to build a new converter (or to
generate procedural geometry), you have only to worry about the input
format (or generation algorithm), and then just call LIBWDB to output
your shapes for later review, editing, and/or analysis.

A more detailed discussion, if required, should probably move to
the <CAD@BRL.MIL> mailing list.

Title: BRL-CAD Symposium '89
.fi


The US Army Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) sponsored the BRL-CAD 
Symposium '89 at the Aberdeen Proving Ground on October 24-25.
This was the second of these annual events and was supported by the American
Defense Preparedness Association.
BRL-CAD is a software package consisting of a 3-D geometric modeling system,
a ray-tracing interrogation library, a generic framebuffer imaging library,
and numerous associated utility packages.
This BRL developed and maintained package has been distributed on a
conditional, non-redistribution basis, free-of-charge to over 500 sites
worldwide.
Such features as source code availability, modularity, adaptability, and
a broad base of applications make BRL-CAD a very attractive package.
This symposium was held to provide an opportunity for an exchange of
information, experiences and ideas associated with the BRL-CAD package.
A total of 23 papers were presented and approximately 100 people attended,
including representatives from academia, DoD agencies, industry, and foreign
governments.
Topics presented covered current applications and work as well as future
planned developments.
BG Malcom O'Neill, commander of LABCOM, presented the keynote address.
The symposium was closed with a panel question and answer session.

I made a variety of improvements to LIBPKG (replacing pkg_get with
a new pkg_process, plus calls to pkg_suckin).  This addresses some
of the performance buffering complications, which turned out to
be more involved than I had first thought (because of all kinds
of unexpected recursion).

pkg_get is only used by REMRT and RTSRV;  they have been changed to
also reflect the new usage.  (The ADDCOMPE folks might benefit from
this, too).

This letter should answer your questions.

The way things like this were handled when I was a student was that each
student who would be using the software was asked to sign a short
agreement with the University.  This creates a form of contract between
the student and University which is valid under local law.  Since all we
really ask is that redistribution be handled by us, and that each
commercialization effort be cleared with us, I suspect that such an
agreement would be simple and inoffensive.  If there was an infraction
that came to light, and for whatever reason your University was not able
to deal with it, then our legal and policy offices would have to
consider the details.

If you require a more detailed response than this, I will have to ask for
an official statement from the legal office, which might take quite some
time.

>  What about updates?

Each time we produce a new release, sites that wish to obtain it must
again send us a blank tape.  While we have a modest budget for postage,
we are not funded to provide magnetic tapes.   Until recently, foreign
sites were asked to re-send through the embassy for each update.
Recently our security office has indicated that updates can be handled
directly.  I don't know if we have processed any update tapes in this
new manner yet, but I assume that it will work fine.

> I fear that the size of the package will make it unacceptably slow in

The package is highly modular;  there are more than 100 different programs.
The 150,000 lines of code figure is for the aggregate.  The two largest
single programs are MGED, the multi-device graphics editor, which has
a base executable of about 1 Mbyte on most machines, and RT, the ray-traced
lighting model, which has a base executable of about 0.6 Mbytes on most
machines.  Of course, dynamic memory is used to contain the data for
the model being constructed.  Without knowing what complexity of modeling
you intend, I can't judge how much memory you might need.  However, I often
run MGED on a Sun-3/50 with 4 Mbytes to perform simple modeling operations
and to inspect existing models, although larger models I work on using a
Silicon Graphics workstation.

While we don't state it precisely in the letter, all we desire is a list
of machine TYPES (eg, Sun-3, Sun-4, Mac II, etc) that you intend to use
the software on.  This is largely so that if you state that you intend
to use the software on a machine that we don't presently support, we can
either (a) warn you of that, (b) try to persuade you to develop that new
support and share the modification necessary to support that new
machine, or (c) put other users who also have those machines in touch with
you.

Our distribution tape contains only source code, no compiled binary
code. Therefore, the one tape contains support for all systems. Thus,
you must have a C compiler for each kind of system that you wish to use.

You are free to use the software on any and all computers that are owned
or operated by your institution.

Of course, if our software proves helpful in your research, I always
enjoy receiving a copy of any papers that might be produced.  It is a
continuing pleasure to observe the many and varied uses that our
software has been put to.

Subject:  Re:  Some Thoughts....

In my mind there are two parts to the issue:

1)  Is it honestly the case that TACOM would consider BRL-CAD, or are the
technical issues just the first in a set of "excuses" to justify their doing
what they want to do?

2)  If it seems that TACOM will seriously consider BRL-CAD, if only certain
technical issues can be addressed, then we need to rapidly produce a written
list of what those issues are.  Within a day or two of having the list,
I should be able to predict roughly how much work it would entail.  Then
we can decide if there is any hope, or not.

As you hinted at in your message, I suspect that the issue of drawings
will head the list of technical issues.  What I still don't understand
well yet is the role that the drawings are expected to play in the
vehicle development process.  Allow me to elaborate:

Producing engineering drawings that are ANSI or ISO compliant, suitable
for use on the manufacturing floor, is not difficult, but entails
addressing literally thousands of little details, each of which will
require some special programming.  Thus, setting out to build software
that will product such a drawing would be a large undertaking.

On the other hand, drawings are entirely unsuitable for computer simulations.
The only audience of a drawing is a human being.

I believe that it is quite possible to produce a wide variety of drawings,
illustrations, and renderings of 3-D solid models, such that the drawing
would convey the full details of the model to a human being.  However,
these drawings, illustrations, and renderings would NOT be standards-
compliant drawings.  They might or might not contain enough information
to be useful on the manufacturing floor.

So, the question is, what happens in the prototype design stage?  For
models/drawings, what is the relative emphasis between these three
areas:

1)  computer simulation
2)  human understanding
3)  specifications for use in manufacturing

If #3 dominates, then BRL-CAD is not the answer.  If #1 and/or #2 dominates,
then BRL-CAD, perhaps with embellishments, should be a fine solution.

Can somebody who knows TACOM better than I do please comment?

Subject:  ARBN Progress

I am happy to report that this evening culminated a rather successful
few weeks of code housekeeping.

I now have a new version of the COMGEOM to BRL-CAD geometry database
converter.  Formerly known as CVT4 and CVT5, this program is now known
as COMGEOM-G, and can handle both versions of the input "deck".

Furthermore, this new program also properly converts the halfspace (HAF)
and ARBN solids as well.

Libwdb has been expanded with routines mk_arbn() and mk_ars().

And, LIBRT now knows how to ray-trace an ARBN.

MGED can draw an ARBN, but does not yet have any ARBN editing capability.

So far, for my ARBN test case, I have been using the AH64 Apache heliocopter.
In a few weeks, I will start soliciting for other folks to help test the ARBNs.

Hopefully, in my spare moments in the next few months, I hope to look at
implementing the few remaining "missing" solids (LOF, WIR, and the ERIM
solids).  Does anyone have a COMGEOM model containing such solids that
they would be willing to share with me for testing purposes?

In the meantime, *polygons*!

Subject:  Re:  BRL Program

Hi.  I got your phone message.  I'll be away on travel for the rest of the
week, so I'll try to give you some answers here.

1)  The space subdivision strategy is a non-uniform bin tree.  Space is
divided into a collection of "cells", each of which is a right
rectangular parallelpiped. All intersections are found with the objects
that occupy that cell, before moving on to the next cell.  A bitmap is
kept of which solids have already been intersected, so that solids which
occupy multiple cells are not intersected more than once.  Depending on
the setting of a_onehit, raytracing either stops on the first hit that
passes the boolean equations (gets a TRUE result), or continues until
the end of the ray.

The existing boolean operation tree (which is separate from the space
partitioning tree) is established in librt/tree.c, largely in the
routine rt_drawobj().  Look for the section with the comment
                /* Store operation on subtree */

The boolean tree is applied to the segment list in librt/bool.c,
in the routine rt_boolfinal(), using rt_booleval().

The space partitioning tree is established entirely in librt/cut.c;
the strategy is to establish a single leaf "node" which contains
everything in the entire model first, and then subdivide it until
certain criteria (not the best criteria, I might add) are met.
This subdivision is used in librt/shoot.c to quickly find the
proper leaf node to consider.  This is the only place the space
subdivision tree is used.  Look for this section of code:
                while( cutp->cut_type == CUT_CUTNODE )  {
                        if( newray.r_pt[cutp->cn.cn_axis] >=
                            cutp->cn.cn_point )  {
                                cutp=cutp->cn.cn_r;
                        }  else  {
                                cutp=cutp->cn.cn_l;
                        }
                }
                if(cutp==CUTTER_NULL || cutp->cut_type != CUT_BOXNODE)
                        rt_bomb("leaf not boxnode");



2)  Boolean tree is entered in MGED using "r" (region) command or
the "comb" (combine) command.  Example:

	r fender.r u tire1 - rod1 - rod2
	comb all u fender.r u hood.r u windshield.r - antenna.r

u=union, -=subtraction, +=intersection.

3)  I think you are referring to this block of code?

int
colorview( ap, PartHeadp )
register struct application *ap;
struct partition *PartHeadp;
{
        register struct partition *pp;
        register struct hit *hitp;
        register struct mfuncs *mfp;
        struct shadework sw;

        for( pp=PartHeadp->pt_forw; pp != PartHeadp; pp = pp->pt_forw )
                if( pp->pt_outhit->hit_dist >= 0.0 )  break;
        if( pp == PartHeadp )  {
                rt_log("colorview:  no hit out front?\n");
                return(0);
        }

The way the routine was set up, with a_hit = &colorview, the routine
colorview() should only be called if the ray hit some geometry.
When the ray is fired from the surface of an object (such as a light
visibility ray or reflection ray), there are occasions where floating
point error will place the exit point of they ray at a slightly
negative distance (typ. -1.0e-10);  in this case, that solid needs
to be ignored.  If no other solid is found, then that is a problem.
Thus the error message.

Does this help?

     I have a comment about the method you give on page 10 to obtain azimuth
and elevation from a direction vector.  Does LIBRT normalize the v?  If so,
you can save yourself the call to

			hypot(v[X], v[Y])

by computing elevation as

			elev = asin(v[Z]).

Certainly MGED uses unit vectors?  I should think that continual updating of
the faceplate in response to knob twists might call for the simpler form.

Subject:  Re:  RTG3 Paper

Paul -

There are good reasons for RT applications using atan2() over acos().

The problem is that asin() is undefined outside the range of -1.0 ..
+1.0, yet sometimes one of the elements of a vector that has "unit"
length may be a few bits larger in magnitude than 1.0 (for example,
1.0000000000001).  On machines like the Cray, the library routine asin()
will abort with a core dump;  in general, the desired behavior is not
well defined.

By using atan2(), there is no opportunity for floating point error to
cause trouble.  The routine atan2(x,y) takes the length of both the "x"
and "y" sides of the triangle for input.  The routine is well defined
for ALL values of "x" and "y". Small floating point errors in the input
(for example, the hypotenuse having length slightly longer than one)
will result in small changes in the output.

Thus, atan2() is robust in the face of numeric error, while acos() and asin()
are not.  It is to obtain this robust behavior that LIBRT and applications
built upon it use only atan2().

I am indebted to Doug Gwyn for first calling this issue to my attention.

On Spark, I have changed all the Cakefiles so that LIBFB no longer contains
"local vendor" type libraries.  Instead, Cakefile.defs defines a new symbol,
LIBFB_LIBES, that lists any and all loader options that have to be used
when linking against LIBFB.  Thus, all Cakefile rules should look like:

	LIB_PRE''LIBFB LIBFB_LIBES

to refer to the framebuffer library.

This has the benefit of greatly reducing the size of LIBFB, and
permits more flexibility in working around oddities (like BLD on the Crays).

I recall your mentioning that you were freeing partition lists

Another advantage of atan2() in many applications is that it gets the

Subject:  Interesting LIBRT details

Greetings -

Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  In your space subdivision algorithm, can boxes overlap each other?

No, at no point in the tree will there be an overlap. The leaves (space
partitioning "box nodes") will never overlap.  A given "cut node" only
""overlaps"" with the children nodes below it.

    Can solids be in more than one box?

Yes, absolutely.  Each solid is listed in every box in which it appears.

    Can a solid in one box overlap a solid
    in another box?

The relationship between two solids, inside a single box, can be determined
simply by considering the solids listed in that box.  For example, a 1-D
example:
		|------ Box 1 ------|------- Box 2 -----|
  Solid A:           AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  Solid B:                               BBBBBBBBBBB

While the ray is in Box 1, there is no overlap between A and B.
Within Box 2, there is an overlap.  What happens in Box 1 will
depend on the boolean formula that defines the region.
(See below for an example).

    Are the boxes handled in any order (like along the ray)
    or are they handled arbitrarily?

The boxes are guaranteed to be traversed IN ORDER along the ray, starting
from the ray origin to +infinity.

  I don't quite understand what the
    following segment of code is doing (it is from the rt_boolfinal() function,
    about 15 lines into the function):

		/* If partition begins beyond current box, stop */
		if( pp->pt_inhit->hit_dist > enddist )
			return;

In the current version of the code (I did some work on this stuff last
week), the whole block of code now reads like this:

		/*
		 *  If partition ends before current box starts,
		 *  discard it immediately.
		 *  If all the solids are properly located in the space
		 *  partitioning tree's cells, no intersection calculations
		 *  further forward on the ray should ever produce valid
		 *  segments or partitions earlier in the ray.
		 *
		 *  If partition is behind ray start point, also
		 *  discard it.
		 */
		if( pp->pt_outhit->hit_dist < startdist ||
		    pp->pt_outhit->hit_dist <= 0.001 /* milimeters */ )  {
			register struct partition *zap_pp;
			if(rt_g.debug&DEBUG_PARTITION)rt_log(
				"discarding early part x%x, out dist=%g\n",
				pp, pp->pt_outhit->hit_dist);
			zap_pp = pp;
			pp = pp->pt_forw;
			DEQUEUE_PT(zap_pp);
			FREE_PT(zap_pp, ap->a_resource);
			continue;
		}

		/*
		 *  If partition begins beyond current box end,
		 *  the state of the partition is not fully known yet,
		 *  so stop now.
		 */
		if( pp->pt_inhit->hit_dist > enddist )
			return(0);

		/*
		 *  If partition ends somewhere beyond the end of the current
		 *  box, the condition of the outhit information is not fully
		 *  known yet.
		 */
		if( pp->pt_outhit->hit_dist > enddist )  {
			if( ap->a_onehit <= 0 )
				return(0);
			if( HITS_TODO > 1 )
				return(0);
			/*  In this case, proceed as if pt_outhit was correct,
			 *  even though it probably is not.
			 *  Application asked for this behavior, and it
			 *  saves having to do more ray-tracing.
			 */
		}

    How do you find only the first hit when a_one_hit is true?  Is this done
    by sorting the boxes in order along the ray?

The "enddist" stuff only comes into play when a_onehit is on. The idea
is to trace through the minimum number of boxes, stopping as soon as
something is hit. Then the boolean formulas are evaluated, to see if
that produces a true result.  Note that in the case where a_onehit=1,
only the IN hit point is valid;  the OUT hit point may wind up being
incorrectly computed. Consider another 1-D example, with the formula
being "A - B":

		|----- Box 1 -----|----- Box 2 -----|
Solid A:	     AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Solid B:                            BBBBBBBBBBBBB

Output partitions:
a_onehit=0	     AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
a_onehit=1	     AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
				    ^^^wrong^^

In the a_onehit=1 case, ray/solid intersection halts in Box 1, and
the formula A-B is evaluated, giving a TRUE result.  However, the
out point of the partition seems to be at the out point of A,
since solid B has no presence in Box 1.  In reality, the out point
of the partition is coincident with the IN point of B.
However, the definition of a_onehit=1 is that only the FIRST hit
(the IN hit) is valid in the partition returned, so this error in
the OUT hit is acceptable, and saves having to intersect the ray with B.
Since the application set a_onehit=1, it "promised" never to use the
out hit, and so this efficiency measure can be employed.

The assumption is that a_onehit=1 mode is used primarily for lighting models,
where ordinarily the surface is opaque.  For those rare surfaces where
there is transmission or reflection, another ray needs to be fired anyways,
to take into account bending due to changes in the refractive index
(for the transmission case) or the Snell's law reflection.

Also note that in the new version of the code, a_onehit is now a COUNT
of the number of accurate hits to be provided by the library in the
result partition.  This has an upwards compatible interpretation with
the previous meaning, and allows certain calculations (pertaining to
internal reflection inside glass, and refractive index tracking) to be
computed much more efficiently, using a_onehit=3 (IN, OUT, IN hits).

2.  What are the inflip and outflip variables in the partition structure used 
    for?

Let me refer to my 1-D subtraction example again, "A - B":

		|----- Box 1 -----|----- Box 2 -----|
Solid A:	     AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Solid B:                            BBBBBBBBBBBBB

result		     AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Understand that the surface normals of each solid always point OUT.
So, you could think of these ray segments having normals like this:

		|----- Box 1 -----|----- Box 2 -----|
Solid A:	  <--AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-->
Solid B:                         <--BBBBBBBBBBBBB-->

result		  <--AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-->
				    ^_____ note direction here!

The normal on the IN hit is just the surface normal of the entry into A.
However, the normal on the OUT hit occurs at the point of entry into B,
and has a normal which is the reverse of B's entry normal.  This is a
natural consequence of subtraction.  Rather than reversing the normal
values in the partition structure, potentially several times, the
pt_inflip and pt_outflip bits are inverted as necessary.  (This saved
some storage in the partition structure, because pt_inhit and pt_outhit
are actually pointers into to the ray segment structure;  the normal
itself is thus shared, and not amenable to modification, without smashing
the interpretation for other partitions).

As a consequence, application program a_hit() routines all need to have
a scrap of code to take this into account, before using a partition's
normal vector, like this:

	if( pp->pt_inflip )  {
		VREVERSE( hitp->hit_normal, hitp->hit_normal );
	}

(Note that the extra {} brackets are needed because VREVERSE is a
multi-line C macro.)

    Also, is the solhit array in that structure used to indicate which
    solids are intersected by that partition?

The pt_solhit[] array is a bit vector, indexed by solid number (st_bit).
If a partition is interior to a solid, then that is indicated by
setting the bit, eg, BITSET( pp->pt_solhit, stp->st_bit ).
After the partition "weaving" is finished (by rt_boolweave(), called
before rt_boolfinal()), every partition is either entirely inside
a solid, or entirely outside;  all partition/solid crossings have
been resolved by splitting the partition into two at the crossing point.

3.  I don't quite understand your overlap handler.  Does this refer to a 
    partition that lies in two or more regions?  Why would you want to
    eliminate such a partition?

The definition of a region is that it is a solid object which occupies
physical space.  It is not possible for two solid objects to occupy the
same space;  when this condition is detected in the model, it represents
a modeling error.  The details of the code are somewhat complicated by
the fact that it can automaticly resolve overlaps between an (optional)
explicitly modeled "air" solid and a non-air solid, in favor of the
non-air solid.

Given than an overlap has been detected, this presents a problem for the
analysis code.  Which region gets to claim the ray (partition)?  The
overlap handler can make two choices:  (a) randomly select one of the
regions, or (b) act as if the partition was not present at all.  Which
one makes more sense depends on the particular application;  the default
overlap handler uses (a).

	Hope this helps,

Subject:  UnixPlot utilities in BRL-CAD

This note is to address a couple of the questions/problems posted
recently about UnixPlot (plot(5)) utilities.

pl-X, pl-X10:

  The reason that these were not included in the standard set of
  compiled software is because they are so minimally useful as they
  now stand.  pl-X has a long way to go before it has any of the
  power of pl-sgi (the SGI IRIS specific plot display program).
  Someday there will be a much better version of pl-X.

pl-ps:

  Many UnixPlot files (e.g. ones generated from Tek'ish programs)
  begin with an extra "erase" command.  pl-ps in release 3.7 would
  (incorrectly) output an extra scale command (NEWPG macro) if it
  sees one of these.  I have a much improved pl-ps that fixes this,
  along with output sizing/centering options similar to bw-ps, if
  anyone is desperate to print PostScript plot files.

Also, note that you can view plot files in MGED with the "overlay"
command.  This provides an alternative way to view them under X
for the time being.

Paul,

If you are using some of our old "pre release" software (e.g. 3.5)
you will see the:

	rt_shootray:  defaulting a_resource to &rt_uniresource

message all of the time.  As of release 3.7 however it should only
come out if you have a librt debugging bit set.  So your best bet
is probably to get some up to date software (and ignore the message
until then).  But FYI...

The resource structure is used to handle parallel processing.  If
you are running on N CPU's, you need N resource structs.  Thus a
single CPU librt process may optionally allocate a resource struct,
while a muti CPU job is required to.

To use rt_uniresource yourself you unfortunately need to:

	extern struct resource rt_uniresource;

	ap.a_resource = &rt_uniresource;
	rt_uniresource.re_magic = RESOURCE_MAGIC;

At that point it would be best to make your own resource struct.
[The RESOURCE_MAGIC deal is an unfortunate technical detail.]

The key is to set your environment variable FB_FILE to something like

"-F /dev/sgil".  This tells rt that you want a LINGERING framebuffer.  You

In brief, here is why the window goes away:

An application (e.g. rt) creates a frame buffer window.  When an
application goes away, so do all of its windows (this is simply part
of the SGI window system, indeed almost all window systems).  The
"l" or linger option causes the application to "fork", i.e. make a
copy of itself to hold the window open, while the parent exits.

An alternate solution is to have some process *other* than the
application actually own the window, and allow an application to
use that window via this other process.  Code to support this will
be in our next release, where that other process is called "fbserv"
(a "frame buffer server", which is a generalization of the "remote
frame buffer daemon" currently called "rfbd").

ps: If you use the "l" option I would also suggest the "p" or private

a Sun 3/[56]0, you understand the situation.   The Mac, running a 68020 just
doesn't have the horsepower of the Iris running a MIPS R3000 and a hardware
graphics pipeline.  The display on the Mac supports only 8-bit "color-mapped"
mode (to my knowledge) so you begin to see the limitations.  In all, I would
recommend the Iris over the Mac for any serious modelling, unless you have no

Subject:  Re:  BRL-CAD on a Mac II

Luke,
I expect that future versions of BRLCAD will have better support
for A/UX.  At this time there are a few problems with a BRLCAD on a Mac.
1) Mac II is about 1.05 vgr's (see bench marking comments)
   With the newer versions of MacIIs I believe that this might be
   much improved.  I also hope to have gcc running for the next test
   run.  (gcc failed bencmarks the last time I tried.  Port problem not
   gcc).
2) Most of the current Macs are using 8bit boards.  This gives only 256
   colors.  Under A/UX, X windoes only allows 254 colors (two reserved
   for the cursor.)  When X supports 24 bits, the color support will be
   available. (X for A/UX 2.0).  At this time I am working on dithers
   for color under X and in Color Cut algorthems to get the best color
   possable with only n colors.
3) Mac Color cards are small.  640-480.  The newest cards released by
   Apple support 24bit color in 640-480 but only 8 bits of color in the
   "Two Page Display"  1024-1024 plus.
4) Mged on a small display is painfull.  It is also the case that each
   change of the model (or view point) requires that the display be repaointed
   This can take a LONG time with a large data base.  This should be improved
   after I finish color support as I hope to add some clipping to reduce
   the number of lines drawn.
5) the rt and rrt commands under mged depend on IPC as due a number of
   utilites (pipes).  MacOS programs under A/UX has some interprocess
   communication problems.  (You can end up blocking on a pipe full because
   the MacOS program is not checking input as it is waiting on a child).

Subject:  Tolerance-based drawing

Over the past two days, I have added support to MGED to permit
the resolution of the display wireframes and NMG tessellated solids
to be variable, controlled by specifying a tolerance.

In MGED, the command "tol abs 3.5" specifies an absolute tolerance
of 3.5 current units.  This means that objects will be drawn and
tessellated so that no line segment or polygonal facet will be
more than 3.5 units distant from the correct location of the surface,
at the worst case part of the surface.  (Which unit is the current
unit is controlled by the "units" command).

The command "tol rel 0.01" specifies that a relative tolerance of 0.01
ie, 1%, is to be used.  This means that objects will be drawn and
tessellated so that no line segment or polygonal facet will be
in error by more than 1% of the size of that particular solid.

The command "tol" will show the current setting.  MGED presently
defaults to no absolute tolerance, and a 1% relative tolerance.

Either or both relative and absolute tolerances may be specified.
If both are given, the tighter tolerance on a solid by solid basis
will be used.  (The relative tolerance is always relative to the
size of each solid).

Note that this tolerance only affects the quality of the MGED display;
it has no effect on the geometry that is stored in the database.
Also note that this feature only exists on the development copy of
the software, expect it in "The Next Release".

Subject:  New Tree Walker

On and off for the past two weeks, one of my projects has been the
implementation of a new, general purpose "tree walker" for BRL-CAD model
databases. The motivation for writing a new tree walker was to support
the NMG work (Non-Manifold Geometry, more on this in some other note),
which needed a tree walker a little different from the existing ones.
Since yet another tree walker was required, I decided to invest a bit of
extra effort and make the new one a fully general tree walker, capable
of replacing all of the half-dozen existing ones. And, at the same time,
I had a "laundry list" of projects waiting to be done, all of which in
some way affected parts of the tree walker.

Fortunately, I was able to clean all the laundry :-) .  Here is the list:

1)  Make this new tree walker be one general routine, suitable for
replacing the existing half-dozen. As a result of this, all the other
features described below should apply uniformly to RT, LGT, etc, as well
as in the viewing commands in MGED ("e", "E", etc).

2)  Support of non-union operations in combination nodes above
regions.  For example, you can create a group which is "vehicle minus cutout"
for a cutaway view, and you get desired effect.  No longer is it necessary
to remove the cutout from each and every region.  This has been a personal
desire of mine for years.

3)  Allow using partial (or full) path specifications, accumulating
transformations along the way.  For example, it is now possible to
do
	e vehicle.g/suspension/l-track/idler vehicle.g/engine/drive-train

and see the "idler" and "drive-train" assemblies drawn in their final
locations, relative to the common combination "vehicle.g".  This satisfies
the suggestion made by Paul Tanenbaum some time ago.

4)  Allow the model tree to be walked and "prepped" in parallel. For
large models, this can take a significant amount of time;  why not use
multiple processors when they are available?  This feature applies to
MGED viewing commands (like "e", "E", etc), as well as to callers of the
LIBRT routine rt_gettrees().  This suggestion was first put forth by
Doug Gwyn at the last CAD Symposium.

Note that rt_gettrees() is a new interface, mandated by the need to
(a) aggregate as many tree tops as possible, and (b) provide controls
for the amount of parallelism (ncpus) to actually be employed.
rt_gettrees() replaces rt_gettree() as the preferred way of loading
trees into LIBRT;  of course, rt_gettree() still exists for code
compatibility.

5)  Better bounding RPP support.  When a region contains non-union
operations between solids, sometimes better model (and region) bounds
could be found than the previous algorithm.  I am grateful to Ed
Davisson for suggesting the improved algorithm which is now used.
Most noticably, this should give much better "view auto-sizing" in RT.

6)  Uniform support of articulation style animation.  Animation
directives are now handled automaticly by the tree walker, so any
programs that use the new tree walker and desire animation capability
can now easily obtain it.  In particular, this will make it easy
for MGED to preview the articulation scripts that RT has been able to
render for some time now.

All of these features seem to be working, and MGED has been largely
converted to use the new tree walker.  Parallel tree walking works
and provides a significant speedup on parallel systems, as outlined
below for a (large) sample database (the Mountain Fortress) on an
SGI-4D/240:

# CPU	speedup	Elapsed Time (sec)
-----	-------	------------
1	1	392
3	2.15	182
4	2.45	156, 159, 161, 163 (avg=159.75)

Notes on parallel tree walking:

1)  Only a portion of rt_gettrees() runs in parallel, so 100% speedup can
*not* be expected.

2) I/O is involved, giving about 20% system time overhead (red bar in
GR_OSVIEW) pre processor.

3)  Quite a bit more optimization is possible, facilitated by the new
framework.

SUMMARY

I believe that the new tree walker addresses all the outstanding issues
in the tree walking area.  It provides new features, improved performance,
and is generally useful, eliminating many different versions of essentially
the same algorithm.

The new software is now part of the current "development" sources on SPARK.
It will be part of "The Next Release".

Subject:  potential portability problem in librt

I notice you're using rt_calloc() to obtain a vector of elements of
various types, initialized to "zero".  Unfortunately, bzero() does not
always work for non-integral types.  For example, some Data General C
implementations do not use an all-zeros bit pattern to represent a null
pointer, so when you use rt_calloc() to set up a pointer array it is
not necessarily full of values that compare equal to null pointer
constants.

There is no simple solution to this (assuming that it is undesirable
to restrict portability to implementations for which this bzero()
trick works).  The obvious two are to just malloc() the array then use
an explicit element initialization loop, or to use memcpy() to blit a
statically initialized object onto the freshly malloc()ed one.  (It is
guaranteed that an object of static storage duration that has no
explicit initializer is preinitizalized to zero values of the
appropriate types, which takes into account architectures that have
unusual null pointer, floating-point zero, etc. representations.)

I notice also that you're relying on C compiler supporting "flexnames"
(long identifiers).  Since the ANSI C standard guarantees at least 31
characters of significance (except for external linkage), this should
not cause long-term problems, although I bet there are still some C
compilers on commercial systems that don't support flexnames.

Subject:  New Tree Walker

On and off for the past two weeks, one of my projects has been the
implementation of a new, general purpose "tree walker" for BRL-CAD model
databases. The motivation for writing a new tree walker was to support
the NMG work (Non-Manifold Geometry, more on this in some other note),
which needed a tree walker a little different from the existing ones.
Since yet another tree walker was required, I decided to invest a bit of
extra effort and make the new one a fully general tree walker, capable
of replacing all of the half-dozen existing ones. And, at the same time,
I had a "laundry list" of projects waiting to be done, all of which in
some way affected parts of the tree walker.

Fortunately, I was able to clean all the laundry :-) .  Here is the list:

1)  Make this new tree walker be one general routine, suitable for
replacing the existing half-dozen. As a result of this, all the other
features described below should apply uniformly to RT, LGT, etc, as well
as in the viewing commands in MGED ("e", "E", etc).

2)  Support of non-union operations in combination nodes above
regions.  For example, you can create a group which is "vehicle minus cutout"
for a cutaway view, and you get desired effect.  No longer is it necessary
to remove the cutout from each and every region.  This has been a personal
desire of mine for years.

3)  Allow using partial (or full) path specifications, accumulating
transformations along the way.  For example, it is now possible to
do
	e vehicle.g/suspension/l-track/idler vehicle.g/engine/drive-train

Subject:  PolySolid Tessellator

This evening, with a little help from Lee, I wrote the first draft
of the PolySolid "tessellator".  The challenge for this one was not
producing the geometry, but instead, re-derriving the topology of
a set of randomly presented facets.  With the creation of two new
NMG library subroutines, I was able to implement a workable first
version.  Performance is O(n**2) or worse, but at least it works.
I'll see about speeding it up in a few days -- I have some ideas on
how to tackle it.

The fun part of this is that I was able to convert an 8396 polygon
fractal mountain that Chris had created into an NMG on the first try.
The viewing of it ran in real time on the SGI at about 5fps.

	Neat stuff!

Subject:  Tolerance on Normals

A few days ago, I reported that MGED had gained a "tol" command to
specify relative and/or absolute tolerances for use when plotting
and tessellating the primitives. Paul Deitz suggested that for some of
the signature work, it could also be useful to specify *surface normal*
tolerances when facetizing, so that an application program could
specify an upper bound on the angular error in surface normals.

I have added "normal" tolerances to MGED's "tol" command, and
implemented it in the torus tessellator. The other tessellators will
pick it up next time they are worked on.

Just for amusement, to satisfy a normal tolerance of 1 degree on the
torus, the tessellator has to generate a 180 * 180 (32,400) polygon
surface! In a large model, this could get to be a lot of polygons.

Subject:  Re:  BRLCAD available on Power Series?

Let me add to Phils remarks.  First, BRL-CAD works fine on the SGI Power
Series.  The machine on my desk is a Power Series 4D/240.

You may have heard of several current issues between BRL-CAD Release 3.7
and SGI's IRIX Release 3.2 (and 3.2.1 and 3.2.2):

*)  It is necessary to modify a few files in the BRL-CAD Release 3.7
software before beginning compilation.  These changes are listed on the
erratta sheet that is shipped with every tape.  These changes are
necessitated by the fact that SGI IRIX Release 3.2 was not made
available until after BRL-CAD Release 3.7, so there was no way the
BRL-CAD software could have been tested in advance.

*)  When running a parallel application that produces images on the
framebuffer, it is necessary to bounce the image through RFBD, because
SGI has a bug in their graphics library that makes it impossible for a
parallel-processing application to produce graphics output (ugh!).
This is easily accomplished by adding the flag -F127.0.0.1: to such
applications, or setting FB_FILE=127.0.0.1: in advance. I knew of this
problem before the BRL-CAD Release was finalized, and spent several days
trying to develop an internal "fix", but nothing worked. When SGI
promised me that this difficulty would be fixed in IRIX Release 3.2,
I gave up.  However, it was *not* fixed in 3.2, so the problem lingers
on. SGI now claims that IRIX Release 3.3 will have this fixed.  Note
again that this is an SGI libgl bug, not a BRL-CAD bug, not that you
as the user care about the distinction.

Other than these two issues, I believe that BRL-CAD Release 3.7 is a good,
solid release, and should give you no trouble.

Please pass this information on to your "sources".  If you have any questions,
please feel free to drop me a line.

For those wondering what BRL-CAD is, here is a quick summary.

The BRL-CAD Package includes a powerful solid modeling capability and
a network-distributed image-processing capability. This software is now
running at over 600 sites. BRL-CAD started in 1979 as a task to provide
an interactive graphics editor for the BRL vehicle-description data
base. Today the package totals more than 150,00 lines of "C" source
code. It runs under UNIX and is supported over more than a dozen product
lines from Sun Workstations to the Cray 2. The package includes:

	A Solid geometric editor
	The Ray tracing library
	Two Lighting models
	Many image-handling, data-comparison, and other supporting utilities

In terms of geometrical representation of data, BRL-CAD supports:

	The original Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) BRL database.

	Extensions to include solids made from collections of 
	Uniform B-Spline Surfaces as well as
	Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline [NURB] Surfaces.

	A facetted data representation.

It supports association of material (and other attribute properties)
with geometry which is critical to subsequent applications codes.
It supports a set of extensible interfaces by means of which geometry
(and attribute data) are passed to applications.

Applications linked to BRL-CAD:

o Weights and Moments-of-Inertia
o Optical Image Generation (including specular/diffuse reflection,
	refraction, and multiple light sources, animation, interference)
o Bistatic laser analysis
o A number of Synthetic Aperture Radar Codes (including codes due to ERIM)
o Acoustic model predictions
o High-Energy Laser Damage
o High-Power Microwave Damage
o An array of V/L Codes
o Neutron Transport Code
o Link to PATRAN [TM] and hence to ADINA, EPIC-2, NASTRAN, etc.
	for structural/stress analysis
o X-Ray calculation

Subject:  Re:  Bug in MGED

The big-E command is notorious for having difficulties.  It is often handy
for a "quick look", but does not handle quite a few cases.  The big-E
command operates by approximating everything as an ARBN, and then ray-tracing
the edges to see what is left.

This does not work for concave objects, like the torus.

There is also difficulty with the big-E implementation of UNION -- it does
not eliminate common area.  Recall that (A union B) is done by joining
all the parts of (A - B) with all the parts of (B - A).  The big-E command
simply joins all the parts of A with all the parts of B.  Greatly
simplifies the code, but produces displays with extra lines.

For the future, the big-E command will be entirely replaced with the NMG
support (non-manifold geometry), which is capable of providing the correct
boolean operations on any combination of primitives.  The NMG support isn't
done yet.  Look for it in the next release.

The big-E command has been a handy visualization tool.  But, please don't
use it's output as a definitive representation of the shape.

Thanks for the bug report!

No.  From the source code (note numbers 1 & 4):

 *  These routines generate "UNIX plot" output (with the addition
 *  of 3-D commands).  They behave almost exactly like the regular
 *  libplot routines, except:
 *
 *  (1) These all take a stdio file pointer, and can thus be used to
 *      create multiple plot files simultaneously.
 *  (2) There are 3-D versions of most commands.
 *  (3) There are IEEE floating point versions of the commands.
 *  (4) The names have been changed.

To support the traditional unix plot commands what you could use is
a simple set of #define's to map xxx(...) into pl_xxx(stdout,...).
[I used to have one of these but a quick search didn't turn it up.]

Subject:  Demoing BRLCAD images on a IRIS 4D.

Hi,
	John Anderson just asked me a question that probably has been
asked many times before: "How do you display your RLE or PIX files in
a loop under the IRIS window manager without the window going away
*and* not end up with a million lingering windows on the screen that
you have to kill manually?".  Well I thought of something that works
real well, I wouldn't be surprised if many of you already discovered
this, but just in case, here goes...

1) Open a lingering, shared high resolution (1024x1024) window as
follows (the '$' is the shell prompt [;-b yuh-hilk]):

$ FB_FILE=/dev/sgil fbclear -h.

2) Send the images with FB_FILE set to the default (/dev/sgi):

$ FB_FILE=/dev/sgi rle-fb foo.rle

This will put up foo.rle, then when that window vanishes, the lingering
window underneath it will get an expose event and redisplay foo.rle
because it is a window into shared memory.  This typically happens so
fast that it doesn't look like second the window vanished at all.

Note: If more than 1 image is to be displayed, substitute step 2)
with a shell loop which prompts you for a Return between images.

Note: If you are mixing high and low res. images, portions of previous
high res. images will still be visable behind low res. ones.  If
all images are low res, change step 1) to use low res.

Note also: this works well remotely.

3) Click the mouse on the window to kill it when you are done.

    Why don't you check with the BRL-CAD folks instead of guessing.
    They finally were convinced that putting local headers in /usr/include
    was poor practice and have changed BRL-CAD to have them where I said.
    To support (for a transition period) existing applications that were
    looking in /usr/include/brlcad, a symbolic link is appropriate, with
    the expectation that it will be removed eventually.

Ok, from a BRL-CAD folk:

No I am not conviced that putting things in /usr/include is a bad
practice.  That is part of a programmers interface to UNIX.  You
should not have to go hunting everywhere for include files and
libraries.

We have decided to start putting all binaries/libraries/include files
etc. for a package xxx (such as brlcad) under /usr/xxx/* for ease
of system maintenance, and "linking it into the system" via a
symlink in /usr/include/xxx to /usr/xxx/include, and by teaching ld
(where possible) about /usr/xxx/lib, and man about /usr/xxx/man.

The last release of BRL-CAD was not configured this way.  The next
one will be.  But the symlink will stay.

Subject: Rookie Questions

I haven't seen any "READ THIS BEFORE POSTING" mail in this group, so
I'll go ahead and ask about some of the things I've run into after
spending an hour or two with the package:

  1) Has anyone done the Cakefile.defs and other changes necessary
     to install brl on a DECstation rather than a VAX?  If so, I'd
     appreciate mail on the subject.

  2) What macro packages do I use to format the docs?  -ms does most
     of it, but I'm left with all the tables unformatted and this
     makes install.doc pretty hard to read.

  3) Has anyone compiled this stuff on a VAX lately?  I tried to build
     it on our 60xx file server running Ultrix 3.1 and I came-up with
     some illegal typedef errors that caused the mged build to abort.
     I haven't tracked them down yet, but it looks like u_char might
     have conflicting definitions between some header file and the
     typedef declarations in dm-xxx.c programs.

     Also, I scanned the Cakefile and it looks like (although I'm brand
     new to all of this) it doesn't even build the X11 interface.  This
     seemed a little strange since that's pretty standard on Ultrix
     (or even vanilla BSD) these days.

Sorry if these are too naive, but I'm taking advantage of the "I'm
just a rookie" excuse while I still can...

Sorry.  I don't have any.

    2) What macro packages do I use to format the docs?  -ms does most

Use "tbl" first.  Most of the documents will have a comment string at
the top with a sample formatting line.  E.g. from install.doc:
.\" tbl install.doc | troff -t -ms | ...
For the papers, there is a Makefile you can look at.

    3) Has anyone compiled this stuff on a VAX lately?  I tried to build
       it on our 60xx file server running Ultrix 3.1 ...

Sorry, "VAX" to me still means a 7xx running BSD.  We have some 60xx's
here running Ultrix.  I will try to make a note to test the next release
on them.  The only Ultrix caveat that I remember is that the C compiler
needed "#define CC_DEFS -Dvoid=int".  That was quite some time ago
though.

     I scanned the Cakefile and it looks like it doesn't even build the
     X11 interface.  This seemed a little strange since that's pretty
     standard on Ultrix (or even vanilla BSD) these days.

Since BRL-CAD is not using "Imakefiles" like X, linking to X can be
a very machine type specific, and even site specific thing.  As it
becomes standard on more and more machines, it will probably get
used by default in Cakefile.defs.  For now, look at the couple of
places it is used in Cakefile.defs for an example of how to add it
to your configuration.

See "fbhelp" to find out what frame buffers are supported on your system.
If X is compiled in it will be "/dev/X".

I wrote a partial NFF -> g translator a year or two ago.  Exporting
g to NFF would be very hard (missing primitives, no booleans, etc.).

You could either (1) "xwd" dump the X window and print it, (2) "release"
the MGED window and "attach" to the "ps" device (which will write a
postscript file for you), or (3) unix plot it with the "plot" command
and convert that to postscript with "pl-ps".

Libfb(3) has some, and brlcad(1) has some, but "fbhelp" is the best

Subject: Choosing Workstations for Use with BRL-CAD


We are considering the purchase of several workstations for use by
individual engineers.  One of the uses of these workstations will be 
modeling with the BRL-CAD package.  Since we want to keep costs low 
(under $25K each) and performance good, the workstations which we are 
currently considering are

            Personal Iris
            Sparcstation
            Decstation
            
We would be interested in hearing any comments about the above machines
as they relate to the BRL-CAD package (or general performance) and any
other machines which the BRL-CAD community deems worthy of examination.
  
Also, since X is available on all of these machines, we are interested in
whether or not color for X-windows will be available in the next release of
the CAD Package and when that release might be expected.  Thanks.

Subject:  Re:  Choosing Workstations for Use with BRL-CAD

I think it will be a long time (if ever) until an X interface to
BRL-CAD will have as high of performance as a platform specific one
(e.g. GL, SunView, StarBase).  On wire-frame displays (MGED), the
Sparcstation under SunView didn't do as bad as I would have thought
compared to a Personal Iris (PI).  Models would "vectorize" at approx
the same speed.  The PI did the resulting wire frame ~4x faster.
I have not benchmarked the Decstation under X.

Other non-X factors are that the next release will include support
(in the SGI GL interface) to do hardware lighting of polygonal
surfaces (and some code to generate those surfaces!, but I'm letting
the cat out of the bag).  24-bit color is also worth considering.

    we are interested in whether or not color for X-windows will be
    available in the next release of the CAD Package and when that
    release might be expected.

Color X support, yes.  Also "frame buffer servers" which will help
all window system machines.  When?  My unofficial answer is that
I can't see it comming out sooner than September, which may mean
Thanksgiving, but I hope it's before then.

Subject:  Re:  Various (repost, with additions)

Greetings!

Sorry about the long delay in responding, I have been swampped with
my preparations for two big conferences (just back from Scotland,
leave in 2 weeks to teach a tutorial, give a paper, and teach a
class at Ausgraph in Australia).  These trips have overwhelmed me
with work!

I forwarded your message to Bill Mermagen.  He returned just in time
to dart off to SIGGRAPH.  His E-mail address is <wm @ brl.mil>.

To answer your questions:

a) I am unaware of anyone having modified the Cakefiles to create
shared libraries on the Sun.  We now have SunOS 4.0.3, so this is
a good thing to put on the "to do" list.

b) We have plans to use the GNU command-line editor library for MGED.
We miss this too, using TCSH as our Shell all the time.

c) Since we write the documentation ourselves (no paid technical writers
here), there isn't as much as I might like.  On the other hand, I think
that we have done astonishingly well.  Terseness is still our biggest
problem, yet more and more users fail to read the manuals due to their
rather large size.  I don't know how to win on this one.  The next set
of manuals will be much thicker;  I don't know if that will help.

For your specific question, it is true that the LGT man page was omitted
from the manual.  However, there is a full paper on it, so that should
help.  It can also be found on the "Road Map" diagram, which shows that
RT and LGT are the two programs to make color shaded images from a .g
geometry database.  RT is a traditional UNIX-tool, which uses command
line options and/or a command script on stdin to tell it how to
render things.  RT can also be invoked from within MGED, to render
the current view.  LGT is a "user friendly" program to allow a user
without a workstation to change viewpoints, change material properties,
lights, etc.  I prefer to use MGED to do that sort of thing, getting
instant feedback via the wireframe display, but then I wrote RT, so
you might expect that...  Unfortunately, both RT and LGT have one or two
capabilities that the other does not.  Competition keeps things interesting.

d)  The next version of the manual will almost certainly require three
volumes.  Man pages for all the URT stuff that we install by default
is included in the printed manual, including the libraries.
(At least, that is my impression).  If you go after parts of URT
that came from the "contributed" directory, then you need to print the
extra man pages there, yourself.  (Mostly device specific stuff there).

The style of the footers was agrivating, but so minor that we didn't
have any interest in re-printing just for that.  Sorry if it bothers
you.  Perhaps you don't understand just how small my group is:
right now, we are three fulltime, with a few occasional helpers
(like Gary Moss, the author of LGT).

e)  We have quite a variety of database IMPORTERs already.  Not all of
them made it into the 3.7 release.  More is planned in this area.
We have almost no interest in more EXPORTERs, except for PDES.
However, we are just finishing a substantial project to permit
approximate polygonal tessellations of the final "developed" shapes
to be exported.  Useful for hardware rendering, thermal analysis,
radar codes, and the like.  This will be the MAJOR new feature in
Release 4.0, and is also the pacing item for the release date
(currently projected for November, sigh).

There is also a big push in Trimmed NURBS and a new Graphical User
Interface Management System (G-UIMS), for Release 4.n where n>0.

Subject:  Re:  [Keith Goldfarb: Re: GIFs]

Hello Keith,

I'm the person at BRL that is (currently) working with reducing the
amount of information in a picture and still having good resulation.

The problem of reducing 24 bits of data to 8 bits of bw or 8 bits with
CLUT (gif format) is not at all simple.  Paul Heckbert (sp) wrote the
definitive paper on 24 to 8CLUT.  His method produces some very nice
output.
	1) Cut from 24 to 15bits by chopping the low 3 bits of each color.
	2) With the reduced color space, count the number of hits for 
	   each color.  (Generate a histogram)
	3) In color space,
		a) cut at median point along the longest axis of largest box.
		b) repeat until you have 256 boxes.
	4) For each of the 256 boxes, pick the center as a color to put
	   in your CLUT.  (Color Look Up Table)

Once you have a CLUT the next step would be to translate your original 24
bit image into an 8bit image of CLUT look ups.

I have not (yet) implimented a color dither program but the theary is the
same as for doing black and white dithering.  I will try and describe 
a Floyd-Steinburg color dither.

	1) zero error line (RGB * length of scanline)
	2) read line from file
	3) going from left to right do:
        Pix += thisline[X];
        thisline[X] = 0;

        value = closest(Pix);
        diff = Pix - value;

        if (X+Dir < width && X+Dir >= 0) {
                thisline[X+Dir] += diff*7/16;
                error[X+Dir] += diff*1/16;
        }
        error[X] += diff*5/16;
        if (X-Dir < width && X-Dir >= 0) {
                error[X-Dir] += diff*3/16;
        }
	return(value)
	4) swap thisline and error;
	5) repeat step 3 going from right to left
	6) repeat until end of file.

The code chunk comes from my black and white version with a few simple
modifications to handle color.  I hope this helps to some extent and
I aplogize for getting long winded.  One of the reasons for babeling
on is that I hope to write a color dither program RSN.

This is the method that I have been told will generate the best
looking color pictures with a reduced color set.  Things to be
careful of are:
	Finding the closest color.
	Lossing an important color.
	Computing the diffrence between the Pixel read and the Pixel used.
	Adding the Error to the Pixel read.

The other method that I have used with fair results to view 24bit pictures
with 8 bits or less is to split the 24 bit image into three 8bit images
of the red, green and blue channels.

Dither each channel as a simple gray scale image down to 6 levels.
Set your CLUT so that CLUT[r*6*6+g*6+b].red=r*255/6;
				       .green=g*255/6;
				       .blue=b*255/6;

Your final CLUT indexs would be red channel *36 + green channel*6 + blue
channel.

This uses only 216 colors but should give you a "reasonable" picture.

Good luck and if you have any questions feel free to e-mail them
to me and or mike.

Subject:  re:Spline Solids


The teapot program is good example for creating a b-spline solid
using the libspl library, the fact that its from IEEE CG&A, is
just a side light. Other splines solids and surfaces should be created 
in a similar manner. But to answer your questions.

1. What determines the # granules of knots?
2. What determines the # granules of ctls?

A granule is the size of a database record as defined in 
h/db.h and usually is a solid description. In a few instances
such as ARS solids and Spline solids a granule can contain 
floating point values of either knots or control points.

Let say you have a spline surface which has 30 knots.
then the number of granules is

	gran = (number of floats) + (sizeof( union record)-1) / sizeof(float));
	gran = (gran * sizeof(float)) / sizeof(union record);


Thus a spline solid database record consists
	B-spline solid header record
		b-spline surface record
			n granules (records) of floats (knots values)
			n granules (records) of floats (control point values)

3. What is the difference between geom type 3 and 4.

	The geom type is whether the b-spline surface control points
	consist of Rational 3 space points (X,Y,Z,W) or 
	Non Rational 3 Space points (X,y,Z).

Subject:  Minor additions

This afternoon, pix-fb, bw-fb, and pixhalve all got a "-a" flag,
which invokes an AUTOSIZE option.  A table of common image sizes
is consulted, and if the input file size matches the size found
in the table, then those values for width & height are used.
This goes a long way to keeping the "headerless" image file formats
convenient to use (given that we often work with images other than
the default 512x512 now).

I imagine that many of the other programs that deal with images
will also acquire this flag.

pixhalve is a program to downsample an image to one-half it's original
size.  It does so using a 5x5 filter kernel to obtain each pixel in
the output file.  The intent was that a single-pixel wide feature in
an input image will be guaranteed to influence at least two pixels in
the output file.  This becomes quite significant when producing images
for NTSC video.  When pixhalve takes a 1280x960 image and makes a
640x480 result which is displayed on a composite NTSC monitor,
the results are really terrific looking images.
It may be possible to do better, but this defines a new high point in
our ability to prepare images for NTSC video display.

Along the way, I added a few lines to libfb/if_disk.c, so that
the framebuffer named "-" is now a synonym for standard output.
If a program that writes to a framebuffer is "well-behaved" and
writes scanlines in ascending order, then that program can be used
in a pipeline for further processing.  As a silly but potent example,

	fbclear -F- 100 200 100 | pixmatte ....

is a way of creating a file of a given color of exactly the right size.
(The other, better, way of actually doing this is with GENCOLOR).

For program that are not well-behaved in writing to the framebuffer,
this can be stacked with the /dev/mem interface, so that things like

	fbgrid -F "/dev/mem -" | pixmatte ....

can be done.

(I wrote this rather lengthy response, to INFO-IRIS.  It seemed worthwhile
to share it with this somewhat larger community as well.  Please note that
many of my assessments are subjective;  if you have achieved different
results, by all means report them.  Mileage varries.  -Mike)

In a recent note to INFO-IRIS, Stuart Levy wrote:

>> From what I hear, super-VHS is supplanting 3/4" tape.  (In fact, JVC and

This is somewhat misleading.  3/4" U-matic tape is also recorded
as separate luminance (Y) and chroma (C), as is regular VHS, Super-VHS,
and many other formats.  The differences between these formats are
in terms of bandwidth available for each signal, and signal/noise ratio.

While some very low-budget operations have begun mastering on S-VHS,
there is no question that S-VHS is a lower quality format than 3/4".
A 5th or 6th generation dub on 3/4" is still of acceptable quality
(although not prizewinning), while the same can not be said of even
a 3rd generation S-VHS dub.  Certainly not with any S-VHS equipment that
I have worked with.

It is important to note that the Y/C bandwidths on 3/4" come in two
flavors as well.  Regular 3/4" has about 260 lines of resolution
(e.g. about 520 pixels/scanline), while SP-format 3/4" has about
360 lines, or about 720 pixels/scanline.  The NTSC format is
bandwidth limited by law to have no more than 720 pixels/scanline,
so this is as good as it gets in real NTSC.  Wider bandwidth signals
can be easily created in your studio (the "multiburst" signal from
most test sets is an example), but it isn't real NTSC.
Thus, the SP version of 3/4" fills roughly the same need for 3/4"
users that S-VHS serves for VHS users, but with the 50 dB video S/N
and tape speed stability of the 3/4" format.

A QUALITY COMPARISON:  Subjective, and Measured.

Just last week, I had the opportunity to make several dubs of my recent
video, and used this chance to compare S-VHS to regular (not SP) 3/4".
I tried to give the S-VHS dub every advantage. I used my NEC 1000 S-VHS
machine ($1000), which I have measured as having about 375 lines of
resolution in S-VHS mode (i.e., full NTSC bandwidth) on the composite
NTSC input. Note that the manufacturer claims this machine to have "425
lines of resolution" when fed a non-band-limited S-Video (Y/C) input
signal (which is hard to come by).

I connected the output of the 1" mastering machine directly to the
composite NTSC input of my S-VHS deck, and used TDK's best S-VHS tape.
Hi-Fi sound was also taken straight from the 1" machine. (BTW, 1"
machines have rather mediocre sound, ~45 dB S/N, compared to better than
80 dB S/N on a Hi-Fi VHS or S-VHS deck). Next, I also made a copy on
3/4", through the regular distribution amps, i.e. I had additional gunky
circuitry in the signal path over the S-VHS dub.

Comparing my S-VHS dub to the 3/4" dub requires no special talent.  The
S-VHS copy is *much* noisier than the 3/4" copy.  And recall, this
is conventional 3/4", *not* the wider bandwidth SP format. The S-VHS is
still quite good to look at, but not nearly as nice as the 3/4". If you
are accustomed to viewing NTSC only on VHS tape, you would not be upset,
but if you are accustomed to viewing NTSC as it exists in the mastering
process, you would mourn the loss.

However, it is true that 3/4" is no longer the best way to capture video.
In order of increasing quality, the competition comes from Hi-8,
Betacam SP, D-2 digital, and D-1 digital.  Betacam SP is a "component"
video system, recording Y, R-Y, and B-Y signals, rather than Y and C.
D-2 is a "composite" (Y/C) digital format, and D-1 is the "component"
(Y, R-Y, B-Y) digital format.  D-2 decks are now available for less than
$50k, and the prices are comming down.  Since a good 3/4" machine costs
from $10k to $30k, this isn't such a large price difference (reference:
the Sony BVU-850 and BVU-870).  Note, however, that while the digital
formats offer zero generation loss, the digital format has inherrent
quantization, which can be quite noticable in the D-2 format.
8 bit samples are just not wide enough;  we need 10 or 12 bits
to satisfy the discerning eye, even with dither used to prepare
the original signal.

Mind you, I'm no big fan of NTSC -- it is a very limiting, low quality
video format.  But, it has supplanted 16mm film (a superior quality
format) as the standard way of communicating scientific results,
so one might as well understand it, and master it.  NTSC, when done
well, can be a very striking and effective way of communicating.

AN EXAMPLE OF MAKING A VIDEO

Just to give you a quick idea of how I created my recent video:

Images were created in RGB at 1280x960, and decimated using a 5x5 filter
kernel down to 640x480.  These RGB images were converted to Y/U/V format,
the U and V data was low-pass filtered to meet NTSC bandwidth limitations,
and the YUV data was transmitted over Ethernet to an Abekas A60 digital
video disk ($60k), where they were stored in D-1 digital video format.

When an entire segment of video had been loaded onto the Abekas, it
was played back in real time, under control of an FCC-approved broadcast
quality sync generator.  The RGB outputs of the Abekas were sent to a
Faroudja CTE-1 RGB->NTSC encoder ($7k), and the composite NTSC was
recorded on a Sony BVU-870 3/4" VTR ($30k) with SMPTE time code generator.

Real-time sequences were captured from an SGI-4D/240 GTX ($100k) with
CG3 board ($7k?). The sync pulses were fed into the CG3.  With the SGI
in NTSC mode, genlocked to "house sync", it provided RS-170 RGB, which
was fed into the Faroudja encoder, and the composite NTSC was recorded
on the BVU-870. I note in passing that the CG3 still does not succeed in
producing broadcast quality video, although it is far better than
earlier attempts.  Unlike earlier SGI CG boards, the output of the CG3
is sufficiently good that it can actually be used, if you don't mind
"tweeking" the Faroudja into forgiving SGI's sins.

Each segment went onto a separate 3/4" cartridge, and all were indexed
event-by-event according to the time codes.  This allowed the script to
call for segments to be assembled with individual frame accuracy.
(Allow me to make a BIG PLUG for the use of SMPTE time code on your
video tapes.  It makes the editing process vastly easier, and more
accurate).

All the 3/4" original tapes went into a big box, and I took it all to
our 1" edit suite.  The original tapes were read on a pair of Sony 3/4"
machines (VO series), stablized by a time base corrector (TBC), routed
through an edit controller with Ampex effects box (for fades and wipes)
and Ampex ADO (for inset screens, flip-away effects, and "MTV" style
rotating and tumbling images), after which each finished sequence was
recorded on an Ampex 1" machine ($50k).

After the video was complete, I added the music to Channel 1, going from
Compact Disc to the 1" machine via a sound board, where the mix to mono
was accomplished. Then, I recorded the narration in a sound booth, onto
a 3/4" tape. Using the same edit system, the narration track was copied
onto the 1" machine (although I'm proud to say that in 8.5 minutes of
narration, I only made one "flub" that we had to splice in a replacement
for.  This was done using the edit system, just like editing video).  At
this point, the master tape was finished.

Dubs for the final distribution were made from the 1" master onto 3/4"
and VHS, through a 1->12 video and audio distribution amplifiers. Thus,
the distribution copies delivered to the clients are only 3rd
generation. Since the trip from 3/4" to 1" is "nearly lossless", the
distribution copies have excellent quality. Given that, in my instance,
distribution is done on 3/4" and VHS, increasing the quality of the
intermediate steps is not likely to make a noticable improvement in the
quality of the product.  The 1" master would be completely suitable for
broadcast.

Even if you don't have the financial resources to engage the services of
a 1" edit suite for your video productions (not that it is very
expensive), and you do all your production and editing in 3/4", you will
get a high quality result.  Certainly better than anything you could produce
on Super-VHS.

FRAME AT A TIME

In the past, I have also done quite a bit of frame-at-a-time recording
of video, using the Sony 3/4" machines and a Lyon-Lamb VAS-4 VTR controller.
This produces results of equal quality (all other elements being equal),
but takes longer.  It is also more of a bother to find and fix botched
frames when recording this way.  It also requires a much smaller
investment in equipment!  ($5k for Lyon-Lamb Mini-VAS, plus a VTR).

LASER DISCS

On a related topic that I won't bore you with this evening, I recently
investigated the quality of LaserDisc players.  They are much better
than consumer videotape (even Beta), but 3/4" tape does even better.
The machines evaluated were the Pioneer CLD-91 ($2000) and Pioneer
CLS-S2 ($3500) [the worlds finest Laser Disc player at the moment].

SUMMARY

*)  3/4" videotape is no longer the best thing around.
*)  3/4" can be used to produce excellent results.
*)  3/4" beats S-VHS every time (video, not audio).
*)  3/4" is mature, and not too expensive.

Many alternatives exist, and lots of good stuff is happening.  Keep your
eyes on Betacam SP and D-2.  If you have (or are) a good video engineer,
there are lots of alternatives.  If you don't have access to a good
video engineer, the business of video recording still has a lot of
pitfalls, and it will pay to be very conservative.  Be suspicious.

Also, most large universities and companies have a TV studio, and there
are many commercial firms in the business.  Strongly consider using them
to assist with your post-production needs.  The aid of a professional
video editor (person) can greatly increase the quality of your result;
knowing when and how to use fades, wipes, etc, is more of an art than a
science. Rates are generally in the $100/hour to $200/hour range, and
often less.

Video resolution is given in lines, not line pairs.  2 lines == 1 line pair
== 2 pixels.  So a vertical resolution of 485 lines is really just
485 pixels.  Horizontal resolution is a bit odd, since it is usually
specified as "lines per picture height" rather than "lines per picture
width".  Because of the 4:3 aspect ratio, a horizontal resolution figure
of "330 lines per picture height" is really "440 lines per picture width",
or 440 pixels, or 220 line pairs.

Even when you see resolution quoted as "330 lines" with no other qualifiers,
they really mean 440 pixels H resolution.  This is because vertical resolution
should always be the same with a properly-interlaced TV, so nobody
quotes it, while horizontal resolution depends on bandwidth which does vary.
And because H resolution is quoted in terms of picture height, not picture
width, even when only H resolution is being given.

This is all a bit weird for those of us used to thinking in pixels.

An NTSC signal is limited to 4.2 MHz bandwidth when broadcast.  This is
equivalent to just about "330 lines" or 440 pixels (horizontal).
More pixels than that doesn't gain you any resolution if it's going to
be broadcast.  Some frame buffers have 512 because it's a convenient
number (power of 2), some use 640-650 because it's a convenient number
(square pixels), but they won't give any more resolution when broadcast.

720 pixels is what is used by D-1 digital recorders; that's just what
the width comes out to with a 13.5 MHz sampling rate.  This probably
allows them to have about a 6 MHz bandwidth, but anything beyond 4.2 will
be lost on broadcast (but is useful for multi-generation processing).

All of the above figures are for luminance bandwidth only.  Colour
bandwidth is always less.  D-1 digital recorders give half as much
bandwidth for the two colour components as the luminance gets,
and everything else is worse.  The NTSC standard itself specifies
about 500 kHz bandwidth for the Q colour channel, which is equivalent
to about 53 pixels horizontally.  Yes, yechh.  That's why colours
smear well beyond the boundaries of the pixels that are supposed to
be coloured.  The I channel gets somewhat more than twice that, but
most (or all) consumer TV sets discard it, limiting both I and Q
to 500 kHz.

I use a package called "psfig" under Latex (or TeX) for including

If you are running under X, the program xdvi can be used to preview

Subject:  new g2asc, asc2g

This evening, I spent several hours testing new versions of g2asc and
asc2g that were provided by Sue.  These new versions have two
major areas of enhancement:

1)  They support particle and pipe solids (similar to GIFT WIR solids).
    (Some of the code was temporarily grafted out of LIBRT until the
    import/export interface exists).

2)  The new asc2g uses LIBWDB for most of it's output operations,
    making it easier to understand and maintain.  This is also an
    important precursor to the (post-Release-4.0) database format change.

This is a nice piece of work.

Because these converters are central to database integrity, and are
critical in the moving of databases from one architecture to another,
they got rather extensive testing.  I solicit other BRL-CAD developers
to experiment with them for a few minutes, when convenient, as an extra
double-check of my testing.

The new software correctly converts all the databases in wolf:/m/cad/db
back and forth, with these caveats:

1)  LIBWDB has the axis of the torus rotated 45 degrees from the way
    that ASC2G did it.  This results in the same torus, but
    the numbers in the file are different.  This kicks out a handful
    of non-harmful differences when comparing solid type 16 records (TOR).

2)  Unused entries for the sphere, polygon, etc, are zeroed now;  they
    used to have garbage in them, which was carried around in the .asc file.

3)  The c_num and m_num fields are forced to zero, and do not propagate.
    (These were GIFT solid numbers once upon a time, and are no longer
    relevant.)

4)  The current working units from the last MGED session (kept in the ID
    record) are not brought along, because the mk_id() routine does not
    allow this field to be set.

With these caveats, the new converters produce the "same" results as
the old converters.  Please speak up if you can break them.

Subject:  Re:  MGED not giving some READ-ONLY messages?

Carl -

This week I have been working on patching up bugs and deficiencies in
MGED and related geometry database tools.  In reference to the note you
sent this summer (see below) I can report the following progress:

*)  The MGED command EDCODES has been fixed to give error messages on
read-only databases. The problem was that EDCODES didn't use the library
routine db_put(), but instead had a (void)write() call.

*)  The UNITS command was not checking an error return.  It now prints
a warning message if appropriate.

*) The TITLE command message "error" has been made more descriptive.

*)  The KILL and KILLALL commands have been changed to check error returns,
and make appropriate remarks.  In general, all uses of the db_*() I/O
routines have had their error return codes checked.  Here is a sampling
of the error messages that might result:

/* For errors from db_get() or db_getmrec() */

Database read error, aborting

/* For errors from db_put() */

Database write error, aborting.
The in-memory table of contents may not match the status of the on-disk
database.  The on-disk database should still be intact.  For safety,
you should exit MGED now, and resolve the I/O problem, before continuing.

/* For errors from db_diradd() or db_alloc() */

An error has occured while adding a new object to the database.
The in-memory table of contents may not match the status of the on-disk
database.  The on-disk database should still be intact.  For safety,
you should exit MGED now, and resolve the I/O problem, before continuing.


/* For errors from db_delete() or db_dirdelete() */

An error has occured while deleting '%s' from the database.\n", _name); \
The in-memory table of contents may not match the status of the on-disk
database.  The on-disk database should still be intact.  For safety,
you should exit MGED now, and resolve the I/O problem, before continuing.

Overall, this should make MGED more informative about errors.
Hopefully, the only common error encountered will be users trying
to modify READ-ONLY databases.  :-)

(Of course, these modifications are only in the experimental versions of
the software.  At BRL, the latest versions should be available for
internal testing in a few weeks.  Just in time for Christmas!)

	Best,
	 -Mike

This message addresses the issues raised by Carl and Dan, below.

A new version of db_addrec() exists, which will try hard to create
temporary names for duplicates.  As an example:

foo.g:  READ ONLY

ATTACHING nu (Null Display)
db_diradd: Duplicate of 'tor', given temporary name 'A_tor'
db_diradd: Duplicate of 'platform.s', given temporary name 'A_platform.s'

Thus, the second instance of the duplicated object can be referred to
by it's temporary name, and perhaps given a better name.  E.g.:

mv A_tor torus3

Carl,

This message is a diagnostic printed at the beginning of an mged session
when mged is building up an internal directory of all the object names
defined in the database. It means that the name mentioned has already been
defined once in the database, and that this second definition for the name
is being ignored as if it did not exist *during this mged session*.

Try this procedure to see what you actually have.
1) Run the conversion from .vg to .g again (might as well start with a clean
   slate).
2) Keep the group "hepro" into a separate file, and kill it in this database.
3) Exit mged, and then start it up again. This allows mged to build its
   directory anew and thus pick up the directory entry it ignored previously.
4) You should see a group called "hepro" still in your database. If so, then 
   somehow there were two objects in the old .vg database called "hepro".
   I don't really know how that would have happened, but there was a lot
   less error checking back then.
5) Assuming you find that you still have an object "hepro", compare it
   to the one in the separate file. (You can bring the other file into 
   the database with some prefix just for comparison.)
6) If, by chance, you still receive the same error message, then you will
   have to repeat this procedure until everthing in your database is
   singly defined. 

One duplicate entry message is printed for each object name found
duplicated. If you see the same object name appearing multiple times
then you have some serious work cut out for you. 

You get rid of the extra definitions by 'keep'ing the duplicated object
into a separate file. Then you kill the object in your database, and exit 
mged. Now start mged up again, kill the object again (to get rid of the
entry that was being ignored), and 'concat' the object back in from your
separate file.

Good luck.

Subject:  mged big-E working (again)

I'm pleased to be able to report that MGED's big-E command
in the current development MGED is working again.

You may recall that when I added the NMG support ("ev" command)
to MGED, using the new tree-walker, I broke the big-E command.

What I have done is to place a private copy of the old tree walker into
the big-E module (proc_reg.c), and given it some private new subroutine
names, so that the big-E command can continue to operate exactly as it
had done in the past, while the remainder of the software can
remain switched over to the new tree walker.
Not the prettiest solution, but pragmatic.

Now I don't have to worry about whether the NMG support will provide
the big-E capability immediately, or not. This also means that when the
handful of known MGED bugs have all been addressed, this new MGED can be
put in the hands of the user community for testing (breaking), well
before the release cycle gets really underway.

	Onwards!

There is only a little bit extra that you will have to add to your
main program, in order to cooperate with the multi-processor support
already provided in LIBRT.  The global RT resource structures will
need initialized, as seen in this excerpt from rt/rt.c:

	/*
	 *  Handle parallel initialization, if applicable.
	 */
	if( npsw > 1 )  {
		rt_g.rtg_parallel = 1;
		fprintf(stderr,"rt:  running with %d processors\n", npsw );
	} else
		rt_g.rtg_parallel = 0;
	RES_INIT( &rt_g.res_syscall );
	RES_INIT( &rt_g.res_worker );
	RES_INIT( &rt_g.res_stats );
	RES_INIT( &rt_g.res_results );
	RES_INIT( &rt_g.res_model );
	/*
	 *  Do not use rt_log() or rt_malloc() before this point!
	 */

However, there remains the issue of handling the dispatching of
work, and the accumulation of results, within your program.
The program RT uses a "self-dispatcher" algorithm, centered on
the semaphored variable "cur_pixel", to manage sharing the work
between the processors.  Here, whenever a processor is ready for
more work, it takes the next pixel in the sceen.  Thus, the
granularity of the parallelism is at the pixel leve.
This can be seen in this excerpt from rt/worker.c:

/*
 *			D O _ R U N
 *
 *  Compute a run of pixels, in parallel if the hardware permits it.
 *
 */
void
do_run( a, b )
{
	cur_pixel = a;
	last_pixel = b;

	if( !rt_g.rtg_parallel )  {
		/*
		 * SERIAL case -- one CPU does all the work.
		 */
		worker();

	nworkers--;
	RES_RELEASE( &rt_g.res_worker );
}

The code above handles the dispatching of the work. This leaves the
issue of disposing of the results. When RT sends it's results
(unbuffered) to a framebuffer, this fragment of code from rt/view.c is
used:

/*
 *  			V I E W _ P I X E L
 *  
 *  Arrange to have the pixel output.
 */
void
view_pixel(ap)
register struct application *ap;
{
	....
	if( fbp != FBIO_NULL )  {
		/* Framebuffer output */
		RES_ACQUIRE( &rt_g.res_syscall );
		fb_write( fbp, ap->a_x, ap->a_y, (char *)p, 1 );
		RES_RELEASE( &rt_g.res_syscall );
	}

If the results are buffered (either for framebuffer or file output)
the results are accumulated in a pixel array called "scanbuf".
The access to scanbuf needs to be single-threaded, because most
RISC machines do not have hardware byte-splice capability:

	/*
	 *  Store results into pixel buffer.
	 *  Don't depend on interlocked hardware byte-splice.
	 *  Need to protect scanline[].sl_left when in parallel mode.
	 */

	case BUFMODE_DYNAMIC:
		slp = &scanline[ap->a_y];
		RES_ACQUIRE( &rt_g.res_results );
		if( slp->sl_buf == (char *)0 )  {
			slp->sl_buf = rt_calloc( width, 3, "sl_buf" );
		}
		pixelp = slp->sl_buf+(ap->a_x*3);
		*pixelp++ = r ;
		*pixelp++ = g ;
		*pixelp++ = b ;
		if( --(slp->sl_left) <= 0 )
			do_eol = 1;
		RES_RELEASE( &rt_g.res_results );
		break;

followed a little later by the actual output section:

	case BUFMODE_DYNAMIC:
		if( fbp != FBIO_NULL )  {
			RES_ACQUIRE( &rt_g.res_syscall );
			fb_write( fbp, 0, ap->a_y,
			    scanline[ap->a_y].sl_buf, width );
			RES_RELEASE( &rt_g.res_syscall );
		}
		if( outfp != NULL )  {
			int	count;

			RES_ACQUIRE( &rt_g.res_syscall );
			fseek( outfp, ap->a_y*width*3L, 0 );
			count = fwrite( scanline[ap->a_y].sl_buf,
				sizeof(char), width*3, outfp );
			RES_RELEASE( &rt_g.res_syscall );
			if( count != width*3 )
				rt_bomb("view_pixel:  fwrite failure\n");
		}

Thus, you can see that the RT application makes use of these semaphore
variables:

res_worker		to protect work-dispatcher variables
res_results		to protect scanline[] and scanbuf[]
res_syscall		to protect system calls (mainly I/O)

(The LIBRT library internally makes use of res_syscall and res_model).

The RES_ASCUIRE() macro begins a critical section, and the RES_RELEASE()
macro ends the critical section.

If you are generally familiar with parallel programming, this should be
enough information to get you going.  If you would like some additional
background on parallel programming, Cray has a small, excellent
publication (number SR-222) that I highly recommend as introductory
reading.  To relate the terminology used, this chart should help:

	BRL-CAD Routine		Cray Routine
	===============		============
	RES_INIT		LOCKASGN
	RES_ACQUIRE		LOCKON
	RES_RELEASE		LOCKOFF
	rt_parallel		TSKSTART plus TSKWAIT

I feel compelled to caution at this point that some algorithms lend
themselves to parallelism much more readily than others do, so the
amount of effort required to parallelize your application may vary.
If, after reading the Cray manual, you feel that you need some additional
guidance, I'd be willing to get together with you and go over your
application.

Subject:  cad/Cakefile.lib fix

Dear John -

Thanks for your bug report about installing BRL-CAD Release 3.7 on your
SGI 4D/210VGX.

In SGI's IRIX 3.3.1, the object-file archiver was modified, necessitating
this matching change to the file cad/Cakefile.lib.  This information
should be added to the errata sheet for Release 3.7;  it has already been
incorporated in the sources for Release 4.0.

My notes regarding this change were:
  "According to the documentation, the "u" option to AR is a modifier
  to be applied to the "r" command, rather than a real command in
  it's own right.  While this has worked fine for a decade or more,
  it broke with SGI Release 3.3.1, sigh.
  Might as well be standard."

The fix is to change line 41, e.g.:

41c41
<       AR u PRODUCTS OBJ EXTRA_OBJ
---
>       AR r PRODUCTS OBJ EXTRA_OBJ

Here is the context diff:

Subject:  New SGI 4D libfb: parallel!

This evening I removed the bug-check code in libfb/if_4d.c which
checked to make sure that only single-thread (uniprocessor) programs
would write graphics directly to the SGI screen.  This had been
necessary because of a long-standing problem in libgl.

In IRIX 3.3.1, the libgl bug no longer exists, and now parallel
libfb programs are free to write to the framebuffer in parallel,
provided of course that framebuffer operations are performed in
a critical section (i.e. bracked by RES_ACQUIRE(syscall)
and RES_RELEASE(syscall) operations).

I have also modified the defaults so that the RT program on the SGI
now defaults to using all the CPUs, rather than just one, since it
will now work.

Considering that SGI makes multi-processor graphics systems, I shudder to
think how many years it has taken to get multi-processor graphics
capability working!  But, at least it is here now.

...Working hard on BRL-CAD Release 4.0...

I have thought about this a lot, (and I've been burned by it a lot
lately), so I have reversed the sense of the -c flag on fbclear.
By default, only the color is sent.  If -c is given, then
cmap and zoom/pan are reset as well.

To prevent novices from getting surprised by this change in behavior,
in default mode, if the colormap or zoom are not normal, a message
is printed.

Not clearing the cmap (especially) is much more consistent with the
growing trend to use gamma correction in the colormaps.
My SGI monitor certainly needs it, and it is tiresome to have to keep
putting the gamma ramp back in.

I tested by editing the same mged file in

1. Two windows on a Silicon Graphics terminal (file was on a server)
2. Two MPX windows on vmb.brl.mil .  Here, I then tried editing a file
   consisting only of 2 solids (call them "original" and "original2").
   In the first window, I said "mv original first", and in the second
   window I said "mv original2 second".  When I have done this, I have
   solids called "first" and "original2" in the first window, and solids
   called "original" and "second" in the bottom window.  Then when I
   exited both MGED runs, and then came back into MGED, I found that the
   solids were called "first" and "second"!  In other words, when I run
   MGED, I seem to have a working version of the file AND a saved version

[ and then details his experiment. ]

Carl and Patrick,

Unfortuneately, it is possible to have two people work on an MGED file
at the same time. The reason it is unfortunate is that the two sessions
both write into the same database, unaware of the changes made by the
other. There is no file locking done by MGED to ensure that only one
person works on a database at one time, and all changes are made
directly in the binary database according to what each MGED session
thinks the database looks like. So Carl is right, some of the changes
made by each can be reflected in the new database, but not all and not
in any reliable fashion.

The important point is that the two sessions are unaware of the state
of the database after changes made by the other. Carl's example is
misleading in that it seems that both sets of changes are retained.
This is due to the simple nature of his experiment, in that the quantity
changed was simply the name field in two objects that already existed
in both databases. If instead the example had looked at the two sessions
each adding new objects to the database then the same results would
not have been seen. Only one set of changes, or one set plus the
fragmented end of the second set (which would probably show up as an
error), would be seen then.

So the rule (at least for now) is don't let it happen!

Subject:  Re:  MGED Question

Yes, I see the item about my experiment changing only the name fields
of existing solids.  But, to respond to Dan Dender, I did not intend
to point out that both sets of changes are retained.  It so happened
that no change I made in my test cancelled another change, but the
saved file still was not the same as either working file at the end
of the respective, simultaneous MGED sessions.

Therefore, I tried an even simpler experiment.  I made a file with just
one solid, called "original", then I ran MGED in 2 windows.  In the first
window, I said "mv original first", and in the second window, I then said
"mv original second".  At this point "tab *" showed the solid to be called
"second" because that was the last name change for that solid in the saved
file (database), but the working files still had "first" and "second" as
the respective names for that solid.  When I left these MGED sessions and
then re-entered MGED, the solid was called "second".

So as you have already heard:  Know what you are doing if you want to
run more than one MGED at the same time on the same file, or don't do it!

From:     Phil Dykstra <phil@BRL.MIL>
Subject:  Re:  MGED Question

Knowing what MGED is doing inside, the answer is pretty clearly no,
i.e. only one MGED can edit a single database at a time.

While you can get away with some things using multiple MGEDs, the
problems will only get worse in the next release where more info is
cached in memory.  Dan brings up an important point though, perhaps
file locking should be used so that any additional MGEDs come up in
Read-Only mode.

Alternately, if people thought that multiple simultaneous edits was a
really important thing, we might be able to construct a scheme with
locking and file stat'ing that would allow this.  However, there would
still be cases which would be hard, if not impossible, to handle (e.g.
in the middle of a solid or object edit, someone else modifies that same
object).

In general, I would suggest that you copy some or all of the database,
work seperately on those copies, and then merge the results back together.

Hello,

This weekend the development version of dm-4d (device manager for
sgi 4ds) was modified so that the perspective mode key (F3) toggled
through verious prospectives.

Originally the perspective key toggled between 90% perspective and
orthagonal.  This would simulate the -p90 and -p0 (or nothing) option 
to rt.

I've changed the perspective key to toggle through 90,60,45,30 and
orthagonal projections.  On keyboards that have led indicators the
perspective light is lit in 90,60,45 and 30 degree modes.

This was done to allow for the previewing of rt anim scripts at
different prospectives.

Mike, Paul,

After getting Paul's e-mail yesterday explaining how he had changed my
id on wizard and killed off the rtsrv to allow him to get work done on
wizard I started thinking about ways to allow users to keep remrt from
using a machine.

To this end I added to new commands to remrt
	hold host	Drop a host and hold from adding.
	resume host	Add a host and release any holds.

To stop an obnoxious rtsrv, do a ps -ef |grep rtsrv.  This will tell
where the remrt is coming from.

	rtsrv whale 4446 'hold wizard.brl.mil'

This command will cause the remrt on whale to drop wizard and to
ignore wizard until further notice.

	rtsrv whale 4446 'resume wizard.brl.mil'

This command will cause the remrt on whale to clear the hold on using
wizard and will start processing on wizard.  If the time is not
correct remrt will drop wizard at the next time check.

Thanks,

Subject:  remrt: /tmp/public_cpus

REMRT's distributed raytracing server, named RTSRV, has gained a new
feature.  When starting up, it reads the file /tmp/public_cpus
to find out how many cpus on that system it may use.
The file contains a single number, in ASCII, on a line by itself.

If the number of public cpus is zero, RTSRV will not continue to run on that
machine.  If the number of public cpus is positive, RTSRV will use that many
cpus (not to exceed the number of physical cpus actually operating at
that time).  If the number of public cpus is negative, RTSRV will use
"all but" that many cpus.  For example, if public_cpus = -2 and
the system has 8 cpus, RTSRV will use 6 ("all but 2").
These semantics follow RT's -P (number of processors) option.

This makes it possible to use some, but not all, the resources of
a given machine for RTSRV.

   It strikes me that this is something of a system configuration file
and should therefore live in {/, /usr/local/, ...}etc, especially if
this is something you envision having long term life (i.e. there for
months at a time).  If you don't want to clutter the main file systems
with this file, I hesitantly suggest /usr/brlcad/lib, though I have
never completely forgiven the folks who brought us /usr/lib/crontab....
This also protects it from those nice little housecleaning scripts.

   If you feel there must be a "public" version of this file, then
I still argue for the above, with rtserv using the more restrictive of
the two.

There really isn't any parallel for this kind of "configuration" file
in UNIX, and we needed something right away, so I just SWAGed it
and threw the file in /usr/tmp.

So far, we have managed to avoid having any system-specific configuration

I'm not sure what the "right" long term implementation should be.

#       define  MGED_CONFIG     GFLAG -DIR_KNOBS=8 -DIR_BUTTONS=32 -DDM_4D

to

#       define  MGED_CONFIG     GFLAG -DDM_4D

e.g., remove the definitions of IR_KNOBS and IR_BUTTONS.
Then:
	cd mged
	cake clobber
	cake

and you should have a working MGED that won't complain about ERROR #104.

I am not certain why FBED might dump core.  Several suggestions:

First, set your environment variable FB_FILE=/dev/debug and try again.
If that seems OK, then try FB_FILE=/dev/sgi and try again.
If you get a core dump again, please run SCRIPT, then inside the
script session, run "dbx fbed" (if FBED comes from another directory,
please use the full path to get to FBED, e.g., "dbx /usr/brlcad/bin/fbed").
Then, inside DBX, give the "where", "dump", and "quit" commands,
exit the script, and E-mail it to me.  That way I'll have some idea
how to advise you.

Do other framebuffer programs operate correctly, like "fbclear 200 0 200" ?

Subject:  Re:  BRL-CAD

OK, I've been prodded.   Here are the answers to your questions.

1)  There is some work in progress to read the solid modeling part
of IGES v.4 files.  In general, IGES files contain *drawings*, not
solid models.  BRL-CAD is a solid modeling system, and not a drafting
system.  We do read quite a number of other solid modeling formats.
(Air Force "PATCH" format, Navy "BSSD" format, etc), and a number
of commercial system interfaces are underway.

2)  What is included?  17 Mbytes of source code and reference material.
See below for a hint.

3)  We only send source, and that one set of source runs on all the supported
platforms.  Suns and SGIs are supported.  One tape is all you have to send.

4)  Basicly, we want you to say "we agree to the terms", and give us
a hint of (a..d).  One sentence each.  For our "brag sheet" to HQ,
never sent to non-Gov't people.

5)  There are copies at Langley, but we'd like to put you on our mailing
list anyway.

6)  We are getting ready to have another BRL-CAD Symposium.
Contact <keith@brl.mil> for info.

-------------- Attachment 2, "the blurb":

The BRL-CAD Package includes a powerful solid modeling capability and
a network-distributed image-processing capability. This software is now
running at over 400 sites.  It has been distributed to 42 acedemic
institutions in twenty states and four contries. 75 different businesses
have requested and received the software including 23 Fortune 500
companies. 16 government organizations representing all three services,
NSA, NASA, NBS and the Veterns Administration are running the code.
Three of the four national laboratories have copies of the BRL CAD
package.

BRL-CAD started in 1979 as a task to provide an interactive graphics
editor for the BRL vehicle-description data base. Today the package
totals more than 150,00 lines of "C" source code. It runs under UNIX and
is supported over more than a dozen product lines from Sun Workstations
to the Cray 2. The package includes:

	A Solid geometric editor
	The Ray tracing library
	Two Lighting models
	Many image-handling, data-comparison, and other supporting utilities

In terms of geometrical representation of data, BRL-CAD supports:

	The original Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) BRL database.

	Extensions to include solids made from collections of 
	Uniform B-Spline Surfaces as well as
	Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline [NURB] Surfaces.

	A facetted data representation.

It supports association of material (and other attribute properties)
with geometry which is critical to subsequent applications codes.
It supports a set of extensible interfaces by means of which geometry
(and attribute data) are passed to applications.

Applications linked to BRL-CAD:

o Weights and Moments-of-Inertia
o Optical Image Generation (including specular/diffuse reflection,
	refraction, and multiple light sources, animation, interference)
o Bistatic laser analysis
o A number of Synthetic Aperture Radar Codes (including codes due to ERIM)
o Acoustic model predictions
o High-Energy Laser Damage
o High-Power Microwave Damage
o An array of V/L Codes
o Neutron Transport Code
o Link to PATRAN [TM] and hence to ADINA, EPIC-2, NASTRAN, etc.
	for structural/stress analysis
o X-Ray calculation

For more details about what geometric models are useful for, see M.
Muuss, ``Understanding the Preparation and Analysis of Solid Models'',
in ``Techniques for Computer Graphics'', ed: Rogers & Earnshaw, Springer
Verlag, 1987.

To obtain a copy of the BRL CAD Package distribution, you must send
enough magnetic tape for 20 Mbytes of data. Standard nine-track
half-inch magtape is the strongly preferred format, and can be written
at either 1600 or 6250 bpi, in TAR format with 10k byte records. For
sites with no half-inch tape drives, Silicon Graphics and SUN tape
cartridges can also be accommodated. With your tape, you must also
enclose a letter indicating

(a) who you are,
(b) what the BRL CAD package is to be used for,
(c) the equipment and operating system(s) you plan on using,
(d) that you agree to the conditions listed below.

This software is an unpublished work that is not generally available to
the public, except through the terms of this limited distribution.
The United States Department of the Army grants a royalty-free,
nonexclusive, nontransferable license and right to use, free of charge,
with the following terms and conditions:

1.  The BRL CAD package source files will not be disclosed to third

Subject:  RT options

This afternoon, I added a few new options to RT, at the request of
several users.  First, the "-c" option, which allows any RT animation
script command to be given on the command line. For example,

	rt -s64 -c "set bounces=7" -c "set" moss.g all.g

allows the maximum number of ray bounces to be changed (first -c
option), and the current viewing-model variables to be displayed (using
the -c "set" command).  Another example is:

	rt -s64 -c "set background=.25,0,.5" moss.g all.g

which sets the background to the current default purple background,
using normalized intensities in the range 0 to 1. This can also be
accomplished with a shorthand option, using RGB values in the range
(0..255):

	rt -s64 -C 63/0/127 moss.g all.g

Note that any non-numeric characters can be used as value separators.
The comma and slash are the two I find myself using most often.

The -c option will be especially useful for the radar codes built as
RT view modules, as it will now allow access to all the
application-specific variables from the command line.  Traditionally,
they could only be set in an animation script, which was not always
convenient.

On a related subject, I am considering changing the default background
color in RT from purple to black (0/0/1).  If you have an objection to
this, please send me E-mail by 6-March.

Subject:  Re:  RT options

The 0/0/1 choice is so that the checkpoint/restart code can tell the
difference between unwritten pixels in the middle of the image
(UNIX zero-fills unwritten sections of a disk file), and background
pixels.  This prevents having to recompute all black background pixels
on a restart.

The choice of 0/0/1 is because the eye is less sensitive to blue,
so that keen-eyed watchers would be less likely to see it than, say,
0/1/0.

Subject:  Re:  RT options

I'm not sure I understand yet.  Yes, REMRT (in particular) does
seek around in the file, and gets big black gaps where CPUs have
not yet answered.

RT, when running in parallel (BUFMODE_DYNAMIC) also seeks around
in the file, as each scanline is completed.

I don't see any difference for compositing, as you would just
	pixmatte foo.pix -C0/0/1 stuff
rather than
	pixmatte foo.pix -C0/0/0 stuff
It would just be a different number to type.

Visually, 0/0/1 is indistinguishable from black 0,0,0 -vs- 0,0,0.0039
in floating point format.  (I've been using slashes for RGB values,
and commas for 0-1 normalized intensities, although the number parser
does not care).

So, please help me understand why 0/0/0 would be better than 0/0/1,
and how I should deal with the checkpoint restart issue then.
I'm genuinely concerned that I've missed some important point!

Mike,
     I've fixed the VI/JOVE commands, the help menu, and the man page.
I also took you up on your suggestion, and added the -T option and the
'T' command, which toggle the sense of the pan commands.  The output

the image.
    As for the choice of option flags... because you said that there
are two camps as far as this panning thing, I thought that eventually
several of the BRL-CAD utilities etc. might support the same kind of
user-selectable behavior.  To facilitate potential standardization,
I found a flag (viz. -T) which does not show up in util/*.1 so that
any other routines that acquire this functionality might use the
same flag.  If this ever came to pass, I guess it would end up in
brlcad.1 as well.

IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification)  Current revision 5.0.

Developed by a committee of representitives of the CAE/CAD/CAM industry.

Published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S.
Department of Commerce.

Contact: Nancy Flower (703) 698-9600 extension 325 to order a spec.

Its primary use is to interchange design data and annotation for
(primarily) mechnical 2D and some 3D databases.

It is a well documented standard, and it is in common use with
mechanical CAD/CAM systems as well as some FE analysis packages.

The standard is not perfect.  It does not transfer 3D solid geometry.
It has a reasonbly rich specification in which many CAD/CAM systems only
implement a subset of its definition.

Strong points:

Documented standard.
Well accepted.

Weak points:

Like all standards, the semantics (based on implementations I've
seen) are not absolutely robust.
Does not handle 3D solid geometry.
The standard is "rich" (i.e. complex in many ways).

Subject:  Re:  IGES opinion from net

Perhaps a little more details on the "inaccuracies" is
in order.

IGES 5.0 addresses other applications as well as mechanical
(electrical, architectural, piping...)

It DOES handle 3D solid geometry, but not all 3D solid
geometry.  For CSG geometry, it handles only a subset of
all primitives  and booleans used in solid modeling packages.
It handles the "block", "right angular wedge", "right circular
cylinder", "right circular cone frustum", "sphere", "torus"
(only circular cross-sectioned torus), "ellipsoid", "solid of
revolution", "solid of linear extrusion", boolean tree (union,
intersection, subtraction), solid assembly, and solid instance.
For B-rep, it should handle most models (as long as there are
IGES entities for the surface types; IGES addresses most of
those, I believe).

We are planning on working with IGES to implement extentions
to the primitive set such that the cones and cylinders
would be more general (corresponding to the BRLCAD TGC),
and adding a general polyhedron, and an ARB8.

Subject:  Re:  IGES solids

I have no information on the ACAD converter.  I know they were working
on it.  It is unclear how they convert their Bezier patches into
solids, since one patch is unlikely to enclose a volume.

Intergraph is working on a converter, under contract to US Army TACOM.
Progress is slow, but they should have something by next year.

I don't see how the IGES support would help.  Both of these activities
have copies of LIBWDB, which gives them the ability to create any
kind of geometry that BRL-CAD supports.  The main difficulties have
been in (a) arranging approximations for solids they may have that
BRL-CAD does not have [a minor problem], and (b) determining how to
infer topological data from DRAWINGS which are *not* solid models,
in order to create a set of solids suitable for use in BRL-CAD.

There are a number of major extensions to the NMG work, to permit
NMG objects to have trimmed-NURBS faces, currently in progress.
This will eliminate all further problems of type (a) above.
The problem in (b) is hard, and in general, can't be solved.
As more people start building true solid models, this will
fade in importance.

Does this explanation help?  If there is some specific conversion task
that you face, perhaps I can suggest how you could do it using LIBWDB.
Rest assured that we do have a serious long-term interest in being able
to import models from commercial systems.  Right now, given current
priorities and funding, that won't be totally finished until FY93
or beyond.  (My biggest problem at the moment is that DoD has been in
a total hiring freeze condition for > 1.5 years now).

The movie.byu geometry file format looks like this:

	write(iunit,80) npn,njn,nptn,nedge
	write(iunit,80) ((npl(i,j),i=1,2),j=1,npn)
	write(iunit,100) ((x(i,j),i=1,3),j=1,njn)
	write(iunit,80) (jp(i),i=1,nedge)
 80	format(10i8)
 100	format(6e12.5)


where npn = number of parts (geometric objects)
      njn = number of nodes (total number of vertices)
      nptn = number of polygons (total over all parts)
      nedge = number of edges (total over all polygons in all parts)
      npl = array of pairs of indices into connectivity array for
	    start polygon node and end polygon node for each part
	    (if there is 1 part then it is a single line = 1 and nedge)
      x   = array of 3D vertices
      jp  = connectivity array - indices of vertices in x array
		making up a polygon with a negative index indicating the last
		vertex of a polygon  (an n-sided polygon would have n entries in
		the connectivity array and the n-th entry would be negated).

I have seen a number of programs that understand this format so its probably
worth knowing.  So does anybody know the file formats for the personal

Nothing really. Vdeck statically allocates arrays to hold info about objects
and solids; the length is configured with two #define constants NDIR and
MAXSOL respectively.  So, periodically as descriptions get larger, these
limits have to be enlarged and vdeck recompiled.  Since I always thought
that people weren't supposed to use GIFT, I haven't bothered to fix vdeck
to dynamically allocate the arrays.  Besides upping the array sizes, I
recently modified vdeck to allow configuration of these constants in the

Subject:  Re:  color in brlcad

Material properties, including color, are assigned to "regions" -
combinations with a special bit set indicating that they, and
everything below them in the model tree, make up one homogeneous
piece of material (not necessarily continuous).  Two regions should
not overlap, since two pieces of material can not occupy the same
physical space.  As such, there should not be any booleans other
than non-overlapping unions ("groups") above region nodes in the
tree.

If you do have any such overlaps, or non-union booleans above the
region nodes, the ray tracer will complain.  Which "material" (e.g.
color) you get in areas of conflict is somewhat non-deterministic.
If you do want to see e.g. an intersection specifically colored, you
should make a region node containing the intersection and assign it
the desired color.  [If the objects being intersected are themselves
regions, the ray tracer will print a warning during the "prep" phase,
and (by default) the material properties of the parent will "win"
and become the properties of the intersection.  Who wins is what the
inheritance property is about.]

I hope that helps.  In case you are just looking for overlaps, note
that there is the rtoverlap utility.

Dick,
	I have already addressed these problems in the current sources
(to be part of the next release of BRLCAD) though I haven't tested it yet
under SunOS 4.1.1 or on a Sparc, just 4.0.3 on a 3/80 where it compiles
cleanly.

I have changed the name of the variables "minor" and "major" in fbed.c to
"mindelta" and "majdelta".

The following is from the current std.h:

#if defined(mips) && ! defined(IRIX3_3)
#define IRIX3_3         1       /* Assume running release 3.3 or later. */
#endif

#if ! IRIX3_3 || ! defined(__SYS_TYPES_H__)

typedef unsigned char u_char;           /* unsigned integer types */
typedef unsigned short  u_short;

#ifdef  pdp11
typedef long            u_long;         /* (not in Ritchie compiler) */
#else
typedef unsigned long   u_long;
#endif
#endif


|> The compiler is also complaining about illegal pointer combinations on
|> calls to the signal function in fbed/execshell.c, lgt/lgt.c, and

This was resolved similarly in fbed and lgt as follows:

[in extern.h]
/* Set pre-processor switch for getting signal() handler declarations right.
 */
#if defined(sun) && ! defined(SunOS4)
/* For Suns running older releases, compile with -DSunOS4=0 to suppress
        bogus warning messages. */
#define SunOS4  1
#endif
#if __STDC__ || (defined(SYSV) && ! defined(cray)) || SunOS4
#define STD_SIGNAL_DECLS 1
#else
#define STD_SIGNAL_DECLS 0
#endif

[Then whenever signal handlers are declared:]
#if STD_SIGNAL_DECLS
STATIC void general_Handler();
#else
STATIC int general_Handler();
#endif

[And, where they are defined:]
/*      g e n e r a l _ H a n d l e r ( ) */
#if STD_SIGNAL_DECLS
STATIC void
#else
STATIC int
#endif
general_Handler( sig )
int sig;

[Finally, the return from each handler:]

#if STD_SIGNAL_DECLS
        return;
#else
        return sig;
#endif

Subject:  VDECK & Geom Export

Over the last few evenings, I have modified the VDECK program to
use the new LIBRT geometry import/export interface.

As a result, the new VDECK in Release 4.0 will be able to handle nearly
all MGED models, except for those where non-GIFT primitives (like NURBS
and NMGs) have been used. This includes booleans above the region
combinations (like tank minus cutaway), groups within regions, regions
subtracted from (or intersected with) other regions, etc., courtesy of
using the new tree-walker. I have also extended it to be able to output
HAF and ARBN solids. For builders of enormous models, all limits on
number of solids have been removed. I'm certain these improvements will
thrill the folks at ERIM, and others who may still use GIFT.

If you have a GIFT deck, you can use COMGEOM-G to convert it to a .g file,
and then use VDECK to get back an equivalent GIFT deck.  I have run several
models back and forth.  This was a good way to catch bugs in the libraries.

For me, the object of the exercise was to demonstrate that new
subroutines for geometry export work, and are easy to use.  VDECK is now
a prime example of this.  The new VDECK source code makes no reference
to db.h (the on-disk format of geometry) at all, so it has no dependence
on the peculiarities of how solids are stored on disk.  This means that
the import/export routines succeed at providing a loss-less interface to
the full MGED database, with much less pain & effort than reading the
database yourself. It also means that VDECK will be unaffected by
database format changes.

This new version of VDECK could be easily modified, for example, to
provide an IGES Solids file (for that set of solids that the systems
have in common), or for other CSG-capable systems.

	Onwards!

Subject:  Release 4.0 schedule etc

Jim -

Thanks for the kind words.  Here is the schedule of events leading up
to Release 4.0:

Mon June 24             (Features Freeze for BRL-CAD Release)
Mon July 1              (Begin VLD-only "alpha" test of Release 4)
Tue July 9              (Begin "beta" tests of Release 4)
Mon July 22             (Planned date to have finalized Release 4)

It is important to be very careful when mixing programs from the
experimental Release 4.0 software and the current production Release 3.7
software.  In particular, .g files created or edited with Release 4.0
software may not work with the old Release 3.7 software.  There are lots
of new goodies in the .g file that didn't exist in 3.7 days.
So, there is "upwards compatability" (all 3.7 databases work on 4.0),
but not "backwards compatability" (4.0 databases will NOT work on 3.7).

So, feel free to experiment, but please be careful, and do it on a
copy of your precious files, rather than on your original!

Subject:  LIBRT identity matricies

My project for this evening was to act on a suggestion made by Harry Reed.
As you may recall, Harry builds very large MGED databases, and he uses
very few modeling transformations.  (He prefers to simply transform the
solids).

Harry noted one day that a 4x4 transformation matrix consumes 128 bytes
of memory, and if he has 30,000 solids with identity transformations,
that is 3.8 Mbytes of memory that could be saved.

I modified LIBRT's "struct soltab" so that mat_t st_pathmat has become
matp_t st_matp.  A null pointer denotes an identity matrix, and non-
identities matricies are malloc()ed as required.  As a byproduct,
this change also makes the "prep" phase go a little faster, too.

Subject:  IGES-to-BRLCAD Translator


     Thanks to some help from Mr. Muuss, the  IGES-to-BRLCAD
translator  (iges-g)  that  I reported on at the last BRLCAD
Symposium will be included in the upcoming release 4.0. Here
is a brief description of its capabilities:

     Iges-g converts IGES files (ASCII  format)  to  BRL/CAD
database  format.   The  IGES file is expected to conform to
the ANSI standard, ASME Y14.26M-1989,  which  is  esentially
IGES  4.0.  All  IGES  CSG  objects  are converted to BRLCAD
equivalents. Most conversions are exact, with the exceptions
of  the  solid  of revolution and the solid of linear extru-
sion. These solids do not exist in BRL/CAD and are therefore
approximated. The solid of revolution is built from a series
of truncated right  cones  developed  by  approximating  the
curve  to  be  revolved with a series of straight line sege-
ments. The extrusion is similarly handled  by  approximating
the  curve  to  be  extruded with straight line segments and
using that to build a BRL/CAD polysolid.

     IGES non-uniform rational B-spline surfaces (NURBS) are
also  converted, but this translator is not intended to be a
BREP translator at this time. All NURBS are combined into  a
single BRLCAD spline solid named "nurb.s".

     An all-encompassing group is  created,  with  the  name
"all",  that  includes  all  the objects in the database not
referenced by other objects.

     I hope this proves useful to some of you.

                         BRL-CAD Release 4.0

BRL-CAD, Release 4.0, is in the final testing phase and will  soon  be
available  for  distribution.   BRL-CAD  is a government developed and
owned geometric modeling software  package.   This  package  uses  the
Constructive  Solid Geometry (CSG) technique where desired volumes are
created by combining basic primitive solids with  boolean  operations.
This  long  awaited release will contain numerous improvements and new
capabilities, the most significant being the  addition  of  n-Manifold
Geometry  (NMG)  support.   NMG  is  a  polygonal  (faceted) geometric
representation, but unlike other polygon  based  systems  stores  full
topological  as  well  as  geometric information.  This means that the
relationships between all NMG  elements  are  continuously  available,
making  it  possible  to  robustly apply booleans to the NMG polygons.
With NMGs, BRL-CAD now has full polygonal support,  allowing  for  the
import  of  other  polygon based geometries.  Furthermore, through the
tessellation and boolean routines, the  current  primitive  based  CSG
geometry  of  BRL-CAD  models  can  readily be converted for export to
polygon based modelers.  Finally, the NMG polygons will allow for full
exploitation   of   the   fast   polygon   fill  available  on  modern
workstations, giving real time shaded display capability for  enhanced
visualization.   Other  additions  to Release 4.0 include a completely
new spline library and new primitive solids(arbitrary  convex  faceted
solid-ARBN,  the  halfspace-HAF, and wire solids-WIR).  There also are
improvements in other areas such as  the  data  base  converters,  the
network  distributed  ray-tracing  software,  and the frame buffer and
ray-trace libraries. POC: Keith Applin, X6647



INPUT PREPARATION FOR PREDICTIVE THERMAL MODELING INCLUDED IN BRL-CAD

IRPREP is a collection of C-programs for extracting geometric and
material properties from BRL-CAD MGED solids models for input into
predictive thermal modeling codes.  One can also generate a correctly
formatted input file for PRISM ( Physically Reasonable Infrared
Signature Model), a code from the Keweenaw Research Center.  These
programs, written by Susan Coates and developed through efforts of the
VLD/ VMB/Signatures Team and the SECAD/WSTB/IR System Technology Team,
determine region volumes, centroids, free and shared surface areas,
adjacent region pairs,  conduction factors, and shape factors.

Each region of an MGED description functions as a node in the
lumped-parameter mesh for PRISM.  Region volumes, used to determine
thermal masses, and region centroids, used in calculation of conduction
factors, are calculated from information gathered by dense parallel ray
sampling of the geometry.  The same ray-trace information is used in
calculating the areas for surfaces that bound air (free) and that are
shared by other regions. Conduction factors are determined from a
user-selected conduction path length function in combination with shared
surface area and adjacent region pair material properties.

The shape factor from region A to region B the fraction of all lines
leaving the surface of region A that have line of sight to region B.
IRPREP determines the shape factors for a set of regions by means of
Monte Carlo sampling. The shape factors are currently used in modeling
the radiative exchange taking place in an engine compartment.

IRPREP will be released in the upcoming 4.0 Release of the BRL-CAD package.

Subject:  Lgt fixed for 3.10.

Mike,
	Lgt did not initialize the res_model semaphore, so it was dumping
core in librt/tree.c:rt_find_identical_solid() where it calls RES_ACQUIRE
on that semaphore.  If you haven't already mentioned this new semaphore in
the release notes, it would be a good idea.  I updated lgt sources on wolf
and the binary on walrus.

	Interestingly, the RCS archive on wolf for lgt/do_options.c was
corrupted;  it yields a truncated file (with a couple of lines of garbage
at the end),  so I copied the archive to do_options.c,v.bad and made a
new archive from a copy I had elsewhere.

	Another change that I noticed in compiling a non-BRLCAD application
with 3.10 was that the re_seg field of the resource struct was changed to
a "struct seg" from a "struct seg *" and that the SEG_NULL macro was
apparently renamed to RT_SEG_NULL.  As it turns out that reference was part
of a workaround that is no longer necessary, so I removed it, but it may
also deserve mention in the release notes.

	At the recent BRLCAD Symposium, John Anderson, Sue Muuss, and

being distributed as part of the BRLCAD package, allows the user to
convert files conforming to the Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)

BRLCAD format.  IGES/CSG was recently approved as an ANSI standard and
was preceded by an earlier version that did not include CSG. The earlier
version of the standard was embraced by commercial CAD vendors and
widely implemented. This translator is the first step in a proposed
effort to develop full IGES compatibility for BRLCAD which would include
a BRLCAD-to-IGES translator and extension of the IGES-to-BRLCAD

       FEASIBILTY DEMONSTRATED FOR AUTOMATIC SOLID MODELING
                  OF AIRCRAFT AIRFOILS

	The Air Systems Branch has just completed a feasibility
demonstration for automatically modeling aircraft airfoil shapes that
use the NACA wing section designations.  Heretofore, geometry modelers
produced rough approximations of airfoil surfaces using constructive
solid geometry techniques by combining shapes such as elliptical
cylinders and wedges. Although  these simple airfoil models were
adequate for ballistic vulnerability analyses, they were deficient for
more rigorous analyses such as signature studies.  The automatic
technique exploits the explicit parametric shape specification in the
NACA numbering designations to produce an interpolating spline
approximation that is extremely close to the actual wing shape; indeed
the final spline shape probably more accurately approaches the
theoretical NACA shape than can be effected in metal fabrication by
airframe manufacturers.  The spline shape is then cast into the BRL-CAD

Subject:  MGED window size

There seems to be quite a debate over the desired initial size of the
MGED window.  Some users want it small, some medium, and some full-screen.

In this release, it will default to nearly full-screen.

In the next release, this should be user settable with some sort of
per-user configuration file, perhaps called .mgedrc !

Subject:  Re:  nirt & librt

There are two issues:

1)  Applications that need dynamic memory should use rt_malloc et.al.
everywhere.  It isn't strictly necessary, but it will really foul up
LIBRT's memory debugging, should you enable it with a -x option.

2)  Applications that need to do I/O **in the parallel sections** should
use rt_log(), or else be careful to protect all that I/O within critical
sections (RES_ACQUIRE/RES_RELEASE).  I/O in non-parallel sections can be
done freely, as you wish.

I hope this removes some of your concerns, and clarifies the rules.

Subject:  Re: cell-fb changes

Kathy,

	There was a problem with the "-h" option to the cell-fb command in the
brlcad/bin directory.  I have fixed this, and the new version will go out with
tonight's upgrade to the beta version of BRLCAD.

Please note that by default, cell-fb "autosizes" the framebuffer to the
smallest framebuffer that will hold the image.  This is why cell-fb prints
the message about fb_size requested/obtained.  This tells you the size (in
framebuffer pixels) of the image being created.  Most of the time, this will
NOT be one of the standard image sizes.  Because of this, the "-a" option on
pix-fb will not be able to get the sizes right.

To generate a cell plot in one of the standard image sizes, you will have to
specify "-h" or something like "-S 0" on the command line to cell-fb.

For the novice user the old messages appeared to be warnings about an

the case.  Non-linear colormaps are used to gamma-correct framebuffers.
For each message, I have selected more "neutral" language:

Subject:  mged 4.0 feature

In response to some of the numerous suggestions from Ed Davission and
his team, Lee and I have added a last-minute feature to mged:  the
.mgedrc file, which mged reads and processes before starting interactive
editing sessions.  .mgedrc files contain commands just like you would
type at the keyboard.

We are presently experimenting with ways that this can become useful,
most notably in the areas of the autosize feature, and (SGI-specific)
variables to control size and placement of the window on the screen.

There isn't time to expand this into a rich facility, but this should
address the most serious issues of mged mode setting, and provide a good
mechanism for future additions.

     I added twelve new "output items" to NIRT.  A highly placed
ACST official stated (not for attribution) that it probably wouldn't
break the 4.0-distribution process to do so.  Anyway, NIRT can now
tell you the components of the entry and exit normals both in model
and view coordinates.  The new item names are of the form:

		    nm_<var>_<loc>

where <var> is an element of

	    {"x", "y", "z", "d", "h", "v"}

and <loc> is in

		    {"in", "out"}.

Of course, nirt.1 has been updated accordingly.

Subject:  Stardent port

Thanks to Phil Dykstra and John Grosh kindly providing me with network
access to a Stardent VISTRA 800 workstation, BRL-CAD has been ported
to it.  Both network and X11 framebuffers work, and MGED superficially
seems to work via X11.  Anyway, if someone gets serious about this
machine, there probably isn't much work left to do.

This was a good effort, because the Stardent C compiler, when run in ANSI
C mode, gave a lot of useful warnings.  There was one mged file that
caused an internal compiler error, but some code simplification fixed that.

In the process, I also ported JOVE to the Stardent and IBM RS/6000,
which will be quite handy to have around.

Subject:  Re:  BRLCAD 4.0beta librt bug.

Gary -

Thanks for once again providing an excellent test case.  I really
appreciate having a reproducable starting point to work from! I was able
to duplicate the effects that you noted, and spent much of the evening
trying to make sense of what was going on.  A valuable byproduct was
that DEBUG_PARTITION output of librt is now even better than before.

The differences between 3.7 and the beta version of 4.0 are due entirely
to the fact that, in the absence of a user-provided overlap handler,
librt simply makes a random choice as to which region will claim the
region of space that has the overlap.  For lots of reasons, the
randomness in 3.7 and 4.0 is not the same, and that explains the
different results.  In the test case you provided, solid "s1" in
region "hull.armor/r1.top" overlaps all the other regions involved.
I have a sketch of the situation on my desk, if you would like to see it.

While studying the output, it struck me that it might be nice if the
default overlap handler made more of an effort to provide some
consistency in the face of overlaps.  So, I extended the return codes
from a_overlap(), to allow the overlap handler not only to indicate
accept/reject as before, but also to indicate WHICH of the two regions
to accept.  This now nicely separates policy (provided by the user) from
the mechanism (still implemented by librt) of handling overlaps.
The default overlap handler has several new heuristics to try and
make more consistent choices, which in at least some cases seems
to be the right thing to do.

In the case of your example:

	rtshot -x 2000 -p 4000 -36 0 -d -1 0 0 ktank.g component

release 3.7 broke the ray into 10 different partitions, while 4.0
of Friday morning broke the ray into 12.  The latest version leaves the
ray intact as a single partition:

--- Hit region /component/hull/hull.ext/hull.armor/r1.top (in s1, out s1)
  InHIT dist=1841 (surf 0)
    Point (2159, -36, 0)
    Normal (1, 0, 0)
    PDir (0, 0, -1) c1=0, c2=0
 OutHIT dist=7175 (surf 1)
    Point (-3175, -36, 0)
    Normal (-1, 0, 0)

which in this case seems to be a reasonable thing to do, since "everything
else" overlaps with r1.top.

RIP does not need to be changed to continue working.  However, if RIP is
to take advantage of the new heuristics, then RIP's f_Overlap() routine
will need to be modified slightly, so as to express more of a choice
than it's present return(1).  Here is how librt's default handler works:


/*
 *			R T _ D E F O V E R L A P
 *
 *  Default handler for overlaps in rt_boolfinal().
 *  Returns -
 *	 0	to eliminate partition with overlap entirely
 *	 1	to retain partition in output list, claimed by reg1
 *	 2	to retain partition in output list, claimed by reg2
 */
int
rt_defoverlap( ap, pp, reg1, reg2, pheadp )
register struct application	*ap;
register struct partition	*pp;
struct region			*reg1;
struct region			*reg2;
struct partition		*pheadp;
{
	.......
	/*
	 *  Apply heuristics as to which region should claim partition.
	 */
	if( reg1->reg_aircode != 0 )  {
		/* reg1 was air, replace with reg2 */
		return 2;
	}
	if( pp->pt_back != pheadp ) {
		/* Repeat a prev region, if that is a choice */
		if( pp->pt_back->pt_regionp == reg1 )
			return 1;
		if( pp->pt_back->pt_regionp == reg2 )
			return 2;
	}
	/* To provide some consistency from ray to ray, use lowest bit # */
	if( reg1->reg_bit < reg2->reg_bit )
		return 1;
	return 2;
}

If you can suggest further refinements, I'd love to hear them!

I hope that this analysis puts your worries to rest about the differences
between 3.7 and 4.0, and will leave you free to resume RIPing away.

	 -Mike

I am not aware of any problems with the header file raytrace.h,
in which rt_shootray() and struct application are defined.

When you file a bug report, it would be most helpful if you would
provide the name of the file that has the source code in it which
is troubling you.  Without more information to go on, I can't be
certain what the issues might be.

If you are attempting to initialize the application structure at
compile time, that won't work from version to version.  Here is
the comment in the header file:


/*
 *			A P P L I C A T I O N
 *
 *  This structure is the only parameter to rt_shootray().
 *  The entire structure should be zeroed (e.g. by bzero() ) before it
 *  is used the first time.
 ...
 *
 *  Note that the organization of this structure, and the details of
 *  the non-mandatory elements are subject to change in every release.
 *  Therefore, rather than using compile-time structure initialization,
 *  you should create a zeroed-out structure, and then assign the intended
 *  values at runtime.  A zeroed structure can be obtained at compile
 *  time with "static CONST struct application zero_ap;", or at run time
 *  by using "bzero( (char *)ap, sizeof(struct application) );" or
 *  rt_calloc( 1, sizeof(struct application), "application" );
 *  While this practice may not work on machines where "all bits off"
 *  does not signify a floating point zero, BRL-CAD does not support any
 *  such machines, so this is a moot issue.
 */
struct application  {
	/* THESE ELEMENTS ARE MANDATORY */
	struct xray	a_ray;		/* Actual ray to be shot */
	int		(*a_hit)();	/* called when shot hits model */
	int		(*a_miss)();	/* called when shot misses */
	int		a_onehit;	/* flag to stop on first hit */
	struct rt_i	*a_rt_i;	/* this librt instance */
	int		a_zero1;	/* must be zero (sanity check) */
	/* THESE ELEMENTS ARE USED BY THE LIBRARY, BUT MAY BE LEFT ZERO */
....
	/* THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS ARE MAINLINE & APPLICATION SPECIFIC. */
	/* THEY ARE NEVER EXAMINED BY THE LIBRARY. */
....
};

If this relates to your difficulty, I would be happy to provide you
with copies of some E-mail traffic that discuss this programming
strategy. Or, if you could provide me with a pointer to your source code
and a test case, I'll make sure that your difficulty gets looked at
and resolved.

Continued discussion of this should be directed just to <acst>, so that
we are not cluttering the mailboxes of the whole Division, e.g. <vld>.

Subject:  Size of BRLCAD 4.0

Many of us have noticed that BRLCAD 4.0beta requires substantially more disk
space than 3.7.  In some cases, utilities have more than doubled in size.
I went looking for the reasons for this today.  It would appear that the
greatest difference comes from the fact that the SGI now links with the X11
libarary.  This is somewhat compounded by the fact that we are not currently 
using a shared library for X11.

As an example, I compiled libfb(3) and fbcolor(1) with and without the X11
support.  Here is the breakdown:

		  Size	  file		coments
		----------------------------------------
		 293760  fbcolor*	No X11
		 818432  fbcolor.X11*	X11 support

I investigated this behavior this evening.  The "rt" command in MGED
currently has a limit of 2000 objects.  However, the SGI operating system
has a limit (called ARG_MAX) on the number of *characters* permitted when
exec'ing a new program (the "command line" to the program).  This limit
is set by SGI at 5120 characters, and in this case, is the limit that
you were running into.  There isn't much that can be done about this,
so your work-around is a good general practice.
