The generic aircraft models were developed in support of the Federal
Aviation Administration's Aircraft Catastrophic Failure Prevention
Program. The models are used to demonstrate the Uncontained Engine
Debris Damage Assessment Model (UEDDAM) tool which evaluates the risk
to the aircraft from uncontained engine failures.  This analysis
supports certification to Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations,
Part 25.903.  The models are for demonstration purposes and do not
depict actual aircraft and /or Aircraft systems in service.  The models
are available for public release.

For example images of these models, see the report:

(Note: the Generic Twin images in that report show the model
prior to its most recent updates, which are reflected in the
version included in BRL-CAD.)
