This software was developed at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology by employees of the Federal Government in the course of their
official duties. Pursuant to Title 17 Section 105 of the United States Code
these files are not subject to copyright protection and are in the public
domain. These files are an experimental system. NIST assumes no responsibility
whatsoever for their use by other parties, and makes no guarantees, expressed
or implied, about their quality, reliability, or any other characteristic.

The test cases are not intended to represent best practice in how to apply GD&T
to a part.  Simpler GD&T strategies could have been used. The test cases are
intended to exercise valid presentations of GD&T defined in the ASME Y14
standards.

The test cases, CAD models, and STEP files can be used without any
restrictions.  Their use in other software or hardware products does not imply
a recommendation or endorsement of those products by NIST.

The verification and validation testing results related to the test case PMI
were generated based on older versions of the CAD systems.  Issues identified
for the semantic and graphic representation of PMI in each CAD system may have
been (and hopefully have been) resolved since the original testing took place.

We would appreciate acknowledgement if any of the test cases, CAD models, STEP
files, or screenshots of the models are used, however, the use of the NIST logo
is not allowed.
