A C-program for MT19937: Real number version
  genrand() generates one pseudorandom real number (double)
which is uniformly distributed on [0, 1]-interval, for each
call. sgenrand(seed) set initial values to the working area
of 624 words. Before genrand(), sgenrand(seed) must be
called once. (seed is any 32-bit integer except for 0).
Integer generator is obtained by modifying two lines.
  Coded by Takuji Nishimura, considering the suggestions by
Topher Cooper and Marc Rieffel in July-Aug. 1997.
