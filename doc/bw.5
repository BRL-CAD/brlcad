.SH NAME
bw \- Black and White image file format and utilities
.SH FORMAT
A
.I bw
file contains sequences of pixels.
Each pixel is stored as one \fBunsigned char\fR, and thus
ranges in intensity from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
The first pixel in a
.I bw
file is the lower left corner of the image.
The pixels proceed from left-to-right across each scanline,
with scanlines being written from the bottom to the top of the image.
.PP
By convention,
.I bw
images are usually square, and thus their dimensions
can be determined by the file size.  If this is not the case, often
only the file width need be known by a program reading the file.  History
has left us with two "standard" sizes, 512x512 and the "higher" 1024x1024.
A common practice for other file sizes is to include the file width in
the filename.
.PP
At some time in the future
.I bw
files will probably get self-typing headers so that parameters such as
their size can be automatically determined by programs.
