============================
BRL-CAD Development Strategy
============================

This is a living org-mode document intended to help define and
maintain a consistent develpment strategy that addresses core
requirements for BRL-CAD.  It recognizes areas of deficiency, outlines
strategic activities, and aims to coordinate development activity.


* Strategic Areas

  This section itemizes areas of strategic weakness and categories of
  actions that could be taken to address them.  From these areas, we
  conceive projects that should be less than 3 months in scope.

** AREA 1: UX                                                            :UX:

*** UI simplification -s                                                  :C:

*** interaction / integration -j                                          :M:
*** editing constraints, snapping, reuse existing coordinates
*** bug reporting / feature requests                                      :P:
*** portability                                                           :p:

** AREA 2: Complexity                                               :Complex:
*** command / tool reduction -cjns                                        :U:
*** API code reduce / simplification / modularity -cjs                    :U:
*** searchability / info -n                                             :U:p:

*** UI design / clarity (UP)
*** restructure of file hierarchy

** AREA 3: Communications                                             :Comms:
*** website -cjns                                                         :C:
*** doc integration, website -cjns                                        :C:
*** new content (audience / customer profiles), website                   :C:

** AREA 4: Marketability                                             :Market:
   
   FIXME: these need to be sorted and ranked

*** conversion: import, processing, export -s                           :P:U:
*** geometry analysis performance (interactive ray tracing / opencl)      :U:
*** 3D printing / polygonal export / gcode -s                           :P:U:
*** industrial design: blueprinting, dimensioning, annotations          :P:U:
*** geometry preparation (killing overlaps, hierarchy, V&V)             :U:C:
*** visuals: advanced rendering, animation, simulation                  :P:U:

* Strategic Projects

  This section itemizes projects conceived to address the above
  strategic areas.  Each project focuses on a single area but should
  have ancillary objectives for all areas for a consistent strategic
  approach.
