BRL-CAD Development Strategy

This is a living document intended to help define and maintain a
consistent develpment strategy that addresses core requirements for
BRL-CAD.  It recognizes areas of deficiency, outlines strategic
activities, and aims to coordinate development activity.


* Strategic Areas

  This section itemizes areas of strategic weakness and categories of
  actions that could be taken to address them.  From these areas, we
  conceive projects that should be less than 3 months in scope.

** AREA 1: UX                                                            :UX:

** TEMPLATE: Project Title

   Here is an example project that summarizes the taxonomy and
   structure of a strategic project.  A project should be scoped to
   less than 3 months of full-time uninterrupted effort.  A project
   must have at least 1 objective.

*** objective

    Objectives should be simple with identifiable completion criteria.
    An objective should be achievable in less than 1 month with larger
    objectives divided into separate smaller chunks.  Each objective
    must have at least 1 task.

**** TODO task

     A task is immiently actionable and should take less than 1 week
     of full-time uninterrupted effort.
