Documentation for the BRL-CAD program 'burst'.

Debian requires packages groff and groff-base.

The original source file ('burst.mm') has been modified slightly to
ensure correct handling by Eric Raymond's doclifter
(http://www.catb.org/~esr/doclifter/).  From an e-mail from Eric:

What you sent is sufficient.  The problem is that your mm file
contains none of the three trigger macros doclifter is looking for as
a way to recognize that it's dealing with mm - .MT, .SA, or .COVER.
The relevant table looks like this:

# This is how we autodetect the right macro set:

interpreter_dispatch = {
    "pp": MeInterpreter,
    "Dt": MdocInterpreter,
    "Dd": MdocInterpreter,
    "Nm": MdocInterpreter,
    "AU": MsInterpreter,
    "NH": MsInterpreter,
    "TH": ManInterpreter,
    "MT": MmInterpreter,
    "SA": MmInterpreter,
    "COVER": MmInterpreter,
    # Extension macro sets
    "supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk": TkManInterpreter,
    "BS": TkManInterpreter,
    "the F register is turned on": Pod2ManInterpreter,
    "ZN": XManInterpreter,
    "Pn": XManInterpreter,
    "ny0": XManInterpreter,
    "reStructuredText": reStructuredTextInterpreter,
    "reStructeredText": reStructuredTextInterpreter,
    "DocBook XSL Stylesheets" : DocBookInterpreter,
    "pdfdest" : FoojzsInterpreter,
    "H0": ASTInterpreter,
    # These are all of the supported Mwww tags
    "URL": MwwwInterpreter,
    "FTP": MwwwInterpreter,
    "MTO": MwwwInterpreter,
    "PIMG": MwwwInterpreter,
    "IMG": MwwwInterpreter,
    "TAG": MwwwInterpreter,
    }

Inserting a dummy .MT 0 call should fix your problem.
