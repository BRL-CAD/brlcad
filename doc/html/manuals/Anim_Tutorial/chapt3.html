<H1>Object Motion</H1>
<P>
Animations involving just camera motion through a static scene or around a
static object are adequate for many different applications.
Using only camera motion, the viewer can see what it would be like to walk
through a building which exists only as a computer model.  The view from the
driver's seat of a new vehicle design can be created.
Even a simulation of an object flying past the viewer can be created
(by flying the viewer past the object instead).
<P>
For a variety of applications, the true value of animation is realized only
when the geometric objects themselves have motion.  Perhaps a vehicle drives
past a familiar stationary landmark and the eye follows the vehicle away after
it enters the scene.
As the vehicle drives over a bump in the road the suspension system is seen
to flex and energy is transferred to the frame.
Things which cannot ordinarily
be seen can be made more visible by watching them change over time.
As our vehicle crosses a bridge, its weight causes it to
flex and vibrate even after the vehicle is gone.
These effects
could be made visible by amplifying them until they are readily observable.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="Matrix Manipulations">Matrix Manipulations</A></H2>
<P>
The animation of objects is accomplished by specifying matrix transformations
to be applied to database elements before each image is calculated.
This allows any solid or combination in the model to have its definition
independently rotated, moved, or resized as the animation proceeds.
<P>
In BRL-CAD matrices are stored in a traditional mathematics form.  This is
different from (the transpose of) the form used in most texts on computer
graphics.  In BRL-CAD matrices are stored as follows:
<PRE>
		<IMG SRC="matrix.gif">
</PRE>
As a result, points and vectors in
3 dimensional space are represented as 4-tuple <I>column</I> vectors.
Points and vectors are therefore properly transformed by the matrix equation:
<Pre>
	<IMG SRC="equation.gif">
</Pre>
Individuals who are unfamiliar with matrix transformations in general
and homogeneous coordinate systems in specific are urged to study
<A HREF="foot_graphics.html">one of the many texts on this subject.</A>
<P>
The matrix operations in a BRL-CAD database can be thought of as living in the
arcs of the directed acyclic graph.
In slightly simpler terms, the matrix lives between an object
(either primitive solid or combination record) and the
parent combination record in the model tree.
The model coordinate system is on
the ``left'' end of a ``stack'' of matrix multiplications which is built up as
the graph is traversed.
When traversing the graph from the root to the leaves,
matrices encountered on the arcs are applied to the ``right'' of the matrix
equation.
For example, the graph formed by ``all.g'' from our geometry file
``moss.g'' can be thought of as the following table:
<PRE>
<IMG SRC="dagtbl.gif">
</PRE>
Purists will note that MatrixA is not directly stored in
the database.  It exists as a conceptual aid to editing models and creating
animations.  In reality MatrixA will be combined with each of the matrices
MatrixPr,
MatrixBr,
MatrixEr,
MatrixCr,
MatrixTr,
MatrixLr
from the table above.
<P>
The program rt would transform the origin (and other parameters) of ``tor''
with the following matrix equation:
<PRE>
	<IMG SRC="trans.gif">
</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="The RT Matrix Operations for Animation">The RT Matrix Operations for Animation</A></H2>
<P>
Each of the matrices in the database can be altered individually during
the animation.  It is also possible to replace the ``stack'' matrix which
has been accumulated.
These operations are achieved with the ``anim'' command in the
input script to rt.
The command has the form:
<PRE>
	anim <I>Path</I> matrix <I>Operation  [Matrix]</I>;
</PRE>
where
<I>Path</I> specifies the arc where the operation takes place.
Either a specific use of the matrix within the model, or all
uses of an arc within the model can be specified.
<P>
The <I>Operation</I> portion of the anim command specifies the matrix
operation to be performed.  The set of valid operations is listed below.
<PRE>
	<IMG SRC="animtbl.gif">
</PRE>
For example, the following command always replaces the matrix on the arc
between ``arm'' and ``hand'' with a new matrix:
<PRE>
	anim arm/hand matrix rarc
		1    0    0    0
		0    1    0    0
		0    0    1    0
		0    0    0    1;
</PRE>
Whereas in
the next example the matrix will be replaced only
when ``arm/hand'' occurs as a direct child of ``body/left'' in the
database tree.
This would permit the left and right hands to be modeled as different
instances of a single hand prototype, and still allow the left
hand to be manipulated without affecting the right
hand.
<PRE>
	anim body/left/arm/hand matrix rarc
		1    0    0    0
		0    1    0    0
		0    0    1    0
		0    0    0    1;
</PRE>
Finally, a command of the form:
<PRE>
	anim hand matrix rarc
		1    0    0    0
		0    1    0    0
		0    0    1    0
		0    0    0    1;
</PRE>
operates on any arc which ends in a node called ``hand'' regardless of where
it occurs in the model hierarchy.
Note that element ``hand'' in these examples above
is  not a leaf node (primitive solid)
in the model graph (With version 4.2 of BRL-CAD and beyond the user
will be able to manipulate the matrices
on the arcs between primitive solids and
their parent combinations).
<P>
All object parameters in the database are stored using
millimeters as the unit of measure.
As a result, all matrix operations are carried out in units of millimeters.
It is important to remember this when preparing matrices for
use with the rt anim command.
An example rt session will serve to illustrate the proper use of the
anim command.
<P>
The following shell script ``trans.sh'' runs rt to create two separate images.
The first is saved in the file ``trans.pix.1'' and is approximately the view
selected for the key-frame ``moss_8'' in Section 2.
The ``pix-fb'' utility can be used to display these images on the framebuffer.
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
rt -M $* -o trans.pix moss.g 'all.g' 2>> trans.log << EOF

eye_pt 20.0 0.0 100;

        0 1 0 80
        0 0 1  0
        0 0 0  1;
end
EOF
<A HREF="transboth.gif"><IMG SRC="transboth_sm.gif"></A>
</PRE>

The second image
is saved in ``trans.pix.2'' and is the same except that the matrix on the arc
between ``all.g'' and ``tor.r'' is replaced with a new matrix.
This matrix has the effect of translating the torus 80 millimeters
along the Y axis of the model coordinate system.
<P>

<P>
It is time to re-visit the animation sequence we developed in Section 2.
We are going to add animation of the objects in the scene to the existing
eye-point movement already created.
The ellipsoid will be given a constant velocity along a vector
which will take it through the center of the torus.
<P>
To make the ellipsoid pass through the center of the torus we must determine
the vector from the center vertex of ``ellipse.s'' to the center vertex of
``tor''

Doing a little vector math we find the vertex of
the ``ellipse.s'' as it is found in ``all.g'' is at:
<PRE>
	<IMG SRC="v_eqn1.gif">
</PRE>
Now we subtract this from the origin of ``tor'' to get a vector that
will translate ``ellipse.s'' to the center of the torus.  This vector is
scaled by a factor to 2 to get a ``net displacement'' vector for the
ellipsoid.
<PRE>
	<IMG SRC="v_eqn2.gif">

<P>
We can now create a new interpolation table with motion values to be
interpolated.
The ellipse will start moving half a second after the sequence starts.
It will reach its destination half a second before the end of the sequence.
Assuming that the time channel is being specified in units of seconds, the
following table results:
<PRE>
<B>chans.ellanim</B>
	0.5     0          0       0
	7.25  -51.78792  -75.7002 -6.72896
</PRE>
The interpolation is done much as it was in Section 2.
The data from ``chans.ellanim'' is read into
interpolation channels 8, 9, and 10 within
<A HREF="chapt9.html#tabinterp">tabinterp</A>.
The use of linear interpolation ensures that the ellipse will move at a
constant rate to its destination.

Note the use of the ``clean'' command to rt at the beginning of each frame
in the template.
This is required after the ``start'' for each frame in rt animation scripts
which use the ``anim'' command.  This command tells rt (librt actually)
to forget any accumulated animation matrices, thereby restoring the geometry
to the form it has in the database.
<P>
We can preview the path that the ellipse will
take by creating a plot file which can be used as an overlay in mged.
(In version 4.2 of BRL-CAD and beyond the
animation sequence can also be viewed using the mged ``preview'' command.)

The ``overlay'' command creates pseudo entries of the form
``_PLOT_OVERLAY_'' in the version of the database in memory.
These are used to store the vectors of the overlay.  They
are never actually objects in the geometric database on disk.
The next time
the overlay command is given, the ``_PLOT_OVER*'' objects are removed and
re-created.  As a result, the message:
<PRE>
  db_lookup:  could not find '_PLOT_OVER*
