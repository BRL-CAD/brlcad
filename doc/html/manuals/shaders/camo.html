<H1>Camoflage shader</H1>
<p>
The "camo" shader creates a pseudo-random tri-color camoflage pattern on
the object using a fractal noise pattern.  This is a procedural shader based
upon a fractal noise function known as fractional brownian motion or fBm.
<p>
The fractal noise function produces
a pseudo- random number in the range [-1.0 ... 1.0] from the 3-space
coordinates of a point in the bounding volume of the region.  This noise value
is used to determine the color of the object at the given location.

<tr><th>Noise value</th><th>Object Color</th></tr>
<tr><td>nv < thresh1</td><td align=center>color1</td></tr>
<tr><td>nv < thresh1<br><center>and</center>nv < thresh2</td><td align=center>color2</td></tr>
<tr><td>nv > thresh2</td><td align=center>color3</td></tr>
</table></center>
<p>
The fractal pattern has infinite resolution.  As a result, the borders of the
color splashes never become pixelated, no mater how close the eyepoint is to the
surface.

<dl>
<dt><b>Lacunarity</b>
<dd>The grid on which the noise function is built is scaled by this value
for each successive octave of noise which will be combined to produce the
final result.
<dt><b>H</b>
<dd>
<dt><B>Octaves</b>
<dd>The number of times the noise grid will be scaled and recombined to
produce the final noise function
<dt><b>Size, Vscale</b>
<dd>If <b>size</b> is set it is used as a scalar which defines the size of the
noise grid on the object.  So if t2=0.5 and size=5mm then splotches of color3
would tend to be no larger than 5-10mm.  If non-uniform scaling is required,
Vscale can specify the grid size in X, Y and Z.
<dt><b>Delta</b>
<dd>This specifies a translation in noise space for the origin of region space.
Since the origin of noise space is reflected 8 ways, it is undesireable to have
that portion of noise space overlap with region space.
</dl>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
Because of the continuous nature of the fractal noise space, it is impossible
to get a splash of color1 directly adjacent to a splash of color3.
