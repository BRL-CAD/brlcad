MGED has several callbacks that get called at strategic
times in order to give the GUI a chance to update itself
after something important has happened.

<UL>
<LI>opendb_callback - this is called after opening a database
to update the command windows' title bar and
to update the raytrace control panel.

<LI>begin_edit_callback - this is called at the start of an edit
to reconfigure the GUI's edit menus and to initialize
other parts of the GUI with information about the solid/object
being edited.

<LI>active_edit_callback - this is called during an active edit,
after MGED perceives a change to the solid/object being edited,
to continuously update GUI components during an edit.

<LI>end_edit_callback - this is called at the end of an edit
to reconfigure the GUI to a non-edit configuration.

<LI>output_callback - this is called when things need to be printed
to the command window(s) (i.e. after issuing a command).

<LI>solid_list_callback - this is called whenever MGED's internal
solid list changes. Note - the solid list changes whenever
solids/objects are
<a href="mged_cmd_index.html#e">e'd</a>
up or when they are
<a href="mged_cmd_index.html#d">deleted</a>
from the display.
