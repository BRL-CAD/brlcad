<h1><a name="top">Table Editor</a></h1>
The
<a href="./teditor.gif">table editor</a>
 displays an animation table in a simple text editor so
that the contents can be viewed and edited with the mouse and keyboard.
In addition, the table editor provides many other functions useful for
animation, such as interpolation, mathematical operations on columns,
and various input/output options.
<p>
Each table editor is labeled with an identifying number,
which is displayed at the top of the window.
Below that label is a column bar which numbers the columns.
This is useful for keeping track of which column is which during
horizontal scrolling of the table.
<p>
Beneath the column bar is the main editing window. If there is a current
animation curve when the table editor is created, then the contents of
the curve are automatically loaded into the editing window. This
creates a table with four columns for the time, x, y, and z
parameters, and one row for each node in the curve.
<p>
After clicking
on the editing window with the left mouse, the user can edit the text.
The editor event bindings are the default bindings for a Tk text
widget, described in detail in the Tk documentation under
<file>libtk/doc/text.n</file>.
Some of the more important bindings are listed below:

<pre>
mouse 1, click			- move insertion cursor
mouse 1, drag			- select text
mouse 1, 3 clicks		- select line
mouse 1, 3 clicks and drag	- select lines
mouse 2, click			- insert selection
Insert				- insert selection
mouse 2, drag			- drag view
arrow keys			- move insertion cursor
shift-arrow keys		- select text
CTRL-/				- select entire contents
Meta-w 				- copy selection to clipboard
CTRL-w				- cut
CTRL-y				- paste
</pre>
In addition, the editor supports many commonly used emacs key bindings
(CTRL-f, CTRL-k, etc.).
<p>
The buttons which implement the rest of the table editor's capabilities
are found in a menu bar at the bottom of the window.
<dl>
<dt><b><a name="Write">Write</a></b>
<dd>

The contents of the table editor can be written to a file, curve, or
view curve. (See the
<a href="./vcurve_doc.html">next section</a>
 to learn about view curves). After specifying one of these three
destinations,  the user is asked for
the name of the file, curve, or view curve to write to, and which
columns of the table should be written.
While a file can accept any number of columns, curves
and view curves are picky about the number of columns they accept. A
curve can accept either three or four columns; in the latter case, the
columns are interpreted as "<var>time x y z</var>", and in the former
case, columns are interpreted as "<var>x y z</var>" and the time of each
node is set to the node index. A view curve may need anywhere from seven
to nine columns, depending on its view format.
If the number of columns in the table is incompatible with the
destination, an error message is displayed.
<p>
To specify which columns of a table will be written to a given
destination, the following syntax is used.
The string <kbd>all</kbd> in this context represents all the columns.
Comma-separated integers are used to identify individual columns: 0
is the
first column and <var>n</var>-1 is the last of <var>n</var> columns.
Dashes represent ranges. For example, <kbd>2-4</kbd>
is identical in meaning to <kbd>2,3,4</kbd>; <kbd>4-2</kbd> is the same
as <kbd>4,3,2</kbd>; and <kbd>4-</kbd> represents columns 4 through
<var>n-1</var>.
<p>
<dt><b><a name="Read">Read</a></b>
<dd>The table editor can read data from a file, another text editor, a
curve, or a view curve. When the <b>Read</b> menu is posted, it contains
a <b>from File</b> option and one option for each of the existing
editors, curves, and view curves.
<p>
If <b>from File</b> is selected, then
the user is asked to  specify
which columns of which file to read.
Buttons on the bottom of the window are used to select one of
three possible insertion modes: Replace, Append, and Add Columns.
Depending on the
insertion mode, the new data will replace the previous table, will be
appended
on the bottom in new rows, or will be added to the right side of the table
in new columns.
<p>
If any of the editor, curve, or view curve options is selected, the
user is similarly asked which source columns should be read and which
insertion mode should be used. The syntax for specifying
columns is the same as that used with the <b>Write</b> option, above.
<p>
<dt><b><a name="Clear">Clear</a></b>
<dd>This button clears the contents of the table editor.
<p>
<dt><b><a name="Interpolate">Interpolate</a></b>
<dd>This button creates an
<a href="./icolumn.gif">interpolation widget</a>
 for interpolating the data in an animation table. When using the
interpolation widget, the first column of the animation table should
always be the time column. Each of the other columns is interpolated with
respect to the first column, using any of
a variety of
algorithms, including step, linear, and spline interpolation.
The interpolator is implemented by a system call to
<a href="./tabinterp.html">tabinterp</a>.
<p>
The interpolation widget contains three boxes
which control the temporal limits and resolution
of the interpolation. The output table begins at
the time labeled <b>Start Time</b> and ends at the time labeled <b>End
Time</b>. The number of output rows created for
each second of time is controlled by the <b>Frames Per
Second</b> parameter.
The start and end times default to the initial and final times in
the input table, and the frames per second parameter defaults to 30 fps,
a common value for animations intended to be shown on video.
<p>
Above these time-control boxes are column-control boxes, labeled by the
index of the output column to which they correspond. Column zero of the
output table is always the time column. Then the box labeled
<b>1:</b> controls the contents of output column 1, and so on.
For each desired output column, the user must provide an interpolation
command in the corresponding box.
To delete an output column, the user need only delete
the interpolation command from the corresponding entry box.
To add an output column, the user creates an new entry box
with the <b>Add Column</b> button and enters an interpolation command.
<p>
The valid interpolation commands
are described below.
The notation <var>i</var> is an integer representing the index of a column
of the
input table, and <var>j</var> represents the index of a
column of the output table.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>step <var>i</var>
<dd>Interpolate column <var>i</var> of the input table with step
functions. In other words, values only change in instantaneous jumps at
the times specified in the input table.
<p>
<dt>linear <var>i</var>
<dd>Interpolate column <var>i</var> of the input table with a piecewise
linear function.
<p>
<dt>spline <var>i</var>
<dd>Interpolate column <var>i</var> of the input table with a cubic spline
curve with open end conditions.
<p>
<dt>cspline <var>i</var>
<dd>Interpolate column <var>i</var> of the input table with a cubic spline
curve with periodic end conditions. Note: the row of the input table
corresponding to <b>End Time</b> is ignored and assumed to be equal to
the row corresponding to <b>Start Time</b>.
<p>
<dt>quat <var>i</var>
<dd>Register column <var>i</var> of the input table as a quaternion
parameter. Four consecutive columns of the output table should contain
quaternion commands, in which case the four columns will be interpolated
jointly using quaternion interpolation. If the number of consecutive
quaternion commands is not a multiple of four, an error message is
displayed.
<p>
<dt>rate <var>start</var> <var>increment</var>
<dd>Create a rate-based column. The first row of the column will contain
the <var>start</var> value, and then successive rows will be change
linearly so that <var>increment</var> units are added for every second of
time.
<p>
<dt>accel <var>start</var> <var>increment</var>
<dd>Create an acceleration-based column. The first row of the column
will contain the <var>start</var> value, and then successive rows will
change exponentially so that the value is multiplied by
<var>increment</var> during every second of time.
<p>
<dt>next <var>j</var> <var>offset</var>
<dd>
This command
creates an output column which is a copy of the output column indexed by
<var>j</var>. The column is shifted forward in time by <var>offset</var>
rows. For example, the command
<code>next 2 3</code> creates a copy of output column 2 with the first
three entries removed. The last entry in the column is repeated three
times so that the resulting column is the same length as column 2.
Negative values are permissible for the offset.
It is an error for a <code>next</code> column to reference itself
or a non-existent output column.
</dl>
<p>
By default, the interpolation widget uses spline interpolation on
each column of the input table, but
all
other interpolation types are available by changing the interpolation
commands.  The <b>Active
Command</b> menu provides a shortcut for changing
the commands for several columns at once.
When the user presses on the label
of a given column, the interpolation command for that column is replaced
with the active command.
For example,
all of the columns could be changed to linear interpolation by selecting
the entry labeled <b>Linear (src)</b> from the <b>Active Command</b>
menu and then clicking on each of the column labels in turn.
<p>
The text on each entry of the <b>Active Command</b> menu
reminds the user of the arguments each
command requires. For example, the label <b>Linear (src)</b> is a
reminder that the <code>linear</code> command requires an integer
argument specifying the source input column.
<p>
<dt><b><a name="EColumns">Edit Columns</a></b>
<dd>This function pops up a
<a href="ecolumn.gif">column editor </a>
 which allows
mathematical operations to be applied to the columns of an animation
table. The editor consists of three parts: the column-control entry
boxes, the button bar, and the <b>Number of Rows</b> field.
<p>
Each column-control entry box is labeled by the index of the output
column to which it  corresponds. For each desired output column, the
user must place an expression defining its contents in the appropriate
entry box. With the exception of some substitutions described below,
these output column definition expressions are treated like
normal Tcl expressions. This means that the whole gamut of Tcl operators
(*,+,!, etc.) and functions (cos, sqrt, floor, etc.) can be
used. Thus a column definition such as:
<code>
sqrt(2.0)/2.0
</code>
results in a column in which the value of every row is set to
<code>0.707107</code>. The precision of the result, which defaults to
six significant digits, can be increased
by setting the global variable <var>tcl_precision</var> to
the desired number of significant digits. For example, ten significant
digits are obtained by typing:
<pre>
mged> <b>set tcl_precision 10</b>
</pre>
in the MGED interaction window. Note that this will effect the
precision to which expressions are evaluated in the entire Tcl environment.
<p>
Much of the usefulness of the column editor comes from the substitutions
which can be performed on a row-by-row basis. A <code>@</code> character
followed by a substitution keyword in the column definition
expression is replaced according to the following rules before the
expression is evaluated:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Replace @i with the index of the current row.
<li>Replace @n with the number of rows the output table will have.
<li>Replace @3 with the contents of column
3 of the input table, and similarly for any other integer.
<li>Replace @pi with the numeric value of the mathematical constant pi.
<li>Replace @e with the numerical value of the mathematical constant e.
</ul>
<p>
For example, the expression <code>@2</code> simply copies column two
from the input table, and the expression <code>(80.0*@i/(@n-1)+20.0)</code>
creates a column which varies linearly from a value of <code>20.0</code> in the first
row to a value of <code>100.0</code> in the last row.
<p>
An output column can be deleted by deleting the column definition from
the corresponding entry box. To add an output column, a new entry box
is created with the <b>Add Column</b> button, and the desired definition
is entered. The specified output columns are created when the <b>OK</b>
button is invoked, and the output table appears in the place of the
input table.
<p>
The parameter to the <b>Number of Rows</b> field determines how many
rows the output table will have. By default, the field contains the
string <code>all</code>, indicating that the output table should have
the same number of rows as the input table. Any other number of rows can
be specified by entering an integer in the box.
Note that if a
table is being created out of nothing (i.e. the input table is empty)
then the number of rows in the output table must be specified explicitly
or the length of the output table will also be zero.
<p>
<dt><b><a name="ETime">Estimate Time</a></b>
<dd>When creating an animation curve, the animator usually knows where
the object should move and how long the whole motion should take, but he
or she doesn't necessarily know the best time parameters for the
intermediate key points. The
<b>Estimate Time</b> function
 calculates
appropriate time values for an animation table containing an animation curve.
The first column of the animation table must be the time
column, and three other columns must specify a path through space.
The <b>Estimate Time</b> function leaves the first and last values in the
time
column unchanged and adjusts the intermediate time values so that the
resulting motion is smooth.
<p>
When the <b>Estimate Time</b> button is pressed, a
<a href="./etime.gif">window</a> pops
up asking for the desired start and end speed of the object.
The user can specify an absolute speed, in millimeters per second, or a
relative speed. A relative speed is specified as a
percentage of the speed needed
to traverse the path in the given time at a constant rate. For example,
if it is intended that the object move at a constant speed along the
entire path, the start and end speeds would both be set to
<code>100%</code>. (These are the default settings.)
Or,
if it is intended that the object start from rest and accelerate to a
final speed of 2 mm/s, the start and end speeds would be 0.0 and 2.0,
respectively. Starting and ending speeds must be positive and must not
be greater than three times the rate corresponding to 100%, or an error
message results. See the
<a href="./anim_time.html">manual page</a>
of the underlying system call for
more information.
<p>
The user is also asked which three
columns of the input table specify the animation path. By default, it is
assumed that these are columns one through three,
but any three columns can be used.
<p>
<dt><b><a name="Clone">Clone</a></b>
<dd>This button creates a new copy of the current table editor
It is good
practice to create a clone before doing interpolations or complicated
column editing, so that data is not accidentally lost.
<p>
<dt><b><a name="Up">Up</a></b>
<dd>This button raises the parent of the table editor to the top
of the stacking order.
<p>
<dt><b><a name="Cancel">Cancel</a></b>
<dd>This button closes this table editor.
