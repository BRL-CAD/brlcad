<h1><a name="top">View Animation </a></h1>
In this section you will learn how to animate the view. It is  assumed
that you have already gone through the steps outlined in the object
animation tutorial. From the main
menu, select <b>CREATE SCRIPT</b> and then choose <b>View</b> from the
posted menu. The object animation window disappears and the view
animation window appears in its place. Change the name of the <b>Output
file</b> to <code>view.script</code>.
<h2><a name="MTEFACurves">Making the Eye Follow Animation Curves</a></h2>
One simple way to animate the view is to designate a path for the eye to
follow, and then orient the view using automatic steering or other
methods. Set the source type to
<b>Source curve</b>, and type <code>spl_path2</code> in the corresponding entry
box. You will make the eye follow the path that the cone did through the
torus. Press the <b>View size</b> button to enter the current view size
into the appropriate box.
Make sure that the <b>Object center</b>, <b>Object yaw, pitch,
roll</b>, <b>Eye point</b>, and <b>Eye yaw, pitch, roll</b> entry boxes
are empty or zero-filled. (A good way to delete the contents of an entry
box is to click on the box with the left mouse, and then type
<code>CTRL-k</code>.) Under <b>Orientation Control</b>, select
<b>No rotation</b>. Finally, press <b>OK</b> to create the view
script.
<p>
Before showing the script be sure to put the MGED display into
perspective mode, with a command such as:
<pre>
mged> <b>set perspective 30</b>
</pre>
This sets a perspective view with a thirty degree field of view.
Perspective views work much better than orthogonal views for animations
such as this one in which the eye moves through the model instead of
just looking at it. To return to an orthogonal view, use the command:
<pre>
mged> <b>set perspective -1</b>
</pre>
On an SGI workstation, the F3 key can be used to toggle the perspective.
Now that the perspective is set, go ahead an show the script.
The eye should move through the torus and along the same path that the
cone followed before. Since there is no rotation, the view has a yaw,
pitch, and roll of 0.
Because the model is fairly sparse, you might see
a lot of empty space in this animation. To get a better feel for where
you're going, you can increase the perspective field of view to 90
degrees or so. (For a funhouse view, try 170 degrees!).
<p>
Change the <b>Eye yaw, pitch, and roll</b> field to <code>-90 0 0</code>,
recreate the script and show the results. This gives the camera a yaw of
-90 degrees, making it face the negative y-axis. Next, change the <b>Eye yaw,
pitch, and roll</b> field back to <code>0 0 0</code> and select
<b>Automatic steering</b>. Re-create the script and show the results.
This time the view faces the direction of motion as it moves along the
path.
<p>
<h2><a name="CScripts">Combining Scripts</a></h2>
At this point, you can combine the script which animates the cone with
the script which animates the view to create a script in which they move
together. (This is why you were supposed to save foo.script, the script
which flies the cone along the curve spl_path2.) From the main menu,
select <b>COMBINE SCRIPTS</b> to pop up the
<a href="cscripts.gif">script-combining window</a>.
On the right side of the window is a listbox which
should show all of the script files in the current directory. Find
foo.script in the list, and click on it with the left mouse button. This
makes foo.script appear in the listbox on the left, which is the list of
files that will be sorted together. You can also type in the names of
the files you want to combine. Type <code>view.script</code> in the
entry box below the <b>Combine Scripts</b> label, and press the Return
key to enter the file into the list. Next, go to the <b>Create
script</b> entry box and enter the name <code>both.script</code>. This
is the name of the file that will be created by combining
<code>foo.script</code> and <code>view.script</code>.
<p>
Press
the <b>OK</b> button to begin combining the scripts. With the short, simple
scripts being used here, this process won't take long, but when
combining long, complicated scripts, the process can take a few seconds
or even minutes in extreme cases. You can halt the process if necessary
with the <b>Halt</b> button that appears while the scripts are being
combined.
<p>
Press the <b>Show Script</b> button to bring up the show script window,
and show <code>both.script</code>. Because the eye and the center of the cone
follow the same path and point the same direction, you will see the
front of the cone in front of you. It is as if the camera were fixed to
the center of the cone. Because the cone was animated with
automatic steering and banking, you will see it bank left and right into
the turns.
<p>
<h2><a name="ATETObjects">Attaching the Eye to Objects</a></h2>
You can use the <b>Eye point</b> box to fix the eye to a point other
than the center
of the cone.
In the view animation window, enter an eye point of <code>-60 0 10</code>. To understand what this
means, imagine that you have a camera at the point (-60,0,10),
which is facing the positive x direction. The camera is attached by an
invisible bar to an invisible tripod at the origin. When the view
script is created, it is the invisible tripod which will be moved and
steered along the path defined by spl_path2. The camera will remain
rigidly attached behind and above the tripod. When this script is
combined with the cone animation script, the eye always remains 60mm
behind and 10mm above the center of the cone. Press the <b>OK</b> button
to recreate view.script, then return to the combine script window and
re-combine foo.script and view.script to make both.script. Show the new
script, and you should see the cone from behind and above as it flies
along its path.
<p>
When giving the view a fixed offset, as you just did, it's not easy to
know exactly where you want the camera to be in relation to the
invisible tripod. The <b>Object center</b> and <b>Object yaw, pitch,
roll</b> entry boxes help to automate that process. Suppose for example
that you want to look down on the cone at an angle from the front. The
first step is to enter the center point and orientation of the cone.
These
should approximately the same values you used when animating the cone.
Before doing this, press the <b>Restore</b> button on the <b>SHOW SCRIPT</b>
window, to put the cone back into its true position in the model.
Turn off perspective viewing
to make centering the
display on the cone easier.
Set the object center by centering the display on the cone and pressing
the <b>Object center</b> button.
Type <code>45 90 0</code> in the
<b>Object yaw, pitch, roll</b> entry box as you did in the
<a href="./object_tut.html#oypr">previous section</a>.
The next step is to manipulate
the display until the desired view of the cone is achieved.
Turn perspective viewing back on, and manipulate the view until the cone appears as you would like to see it.
You could try, for example, executing the command:
<pre>
mged> <b>viewset ypr 0 -40 120</b>
</pre>
to look at the top left of the cone.
When you have the view of the cone that you want, press the <b>Eye
point</b> and <b>Eye yaw, pitch, roll</b> buttons to enter the current
values. Now, create the view script and combine it with foo.script to
create a new both.script. When you show this script, the cone should
move along its usual path, and the view should be fixed to the cone in
the way that you specified.
<p>
If you need to attach the view to a moving object in more complicated ways,
you
should consult the <a href="./anim_cascade.html">anim_cascade man page</a>.
This routine could be used, for example, to make the eye pan in a circle
around the cone as it flies.
<p>
<h2><a name="UAEPAALAPath">Using an Eye Path and a Look-at Path</a></h2>
Another useful common way of manipulating the view is to specify where
the eye should be and what it should look at in every frame. In this
example, you will move the eye along an edge of the square platform
while it looks toward the cone.
Go to the curve editor and make the last node of the path curve current.
Make a note of the time for this node, which is displayed
in the entry next to the <b>Time</b> label. You will now create an eye
curve which must end at the same time.
Open a new curve by clicking on the
<b>Current curve</b> label, selecting <b>New curve</b> from the posted
menu, and typing <code>eye</code> for the name of the curve. Center the
display on a point just above the top left corner of the square platform
(as seen from a top view). Press <b>ADD</b> to make this the first point
in the eye curve. Center the display on a point just above the bottom
left corner of the platform, and add this to the eye curve. Click on the
entry box next to the <b>Time</b> label with the left mouse, and change
the time parameter of this node to match the last time parameter of the
path curve. Be sure to press the <code>Return</code> key to apply
the new time value
to the curve. Press the <b>Spline Interpolate</b> button to create an
interpolated curve called spl_eye.
<p>
The next step is to create an animation table which contains the eye
curve and the path curve. Open a new or existing table editor using the
<b>TABLE EDITOR</b> button on the main menu. Press the <b>Read</b>
button and
select <b>from curve spl_eye</b> from the posted menu. On the input
request window which pops up, make sure that <b>Replace</b> mode is
enabled and that all columns will be read, then press <b>OK</b>.
The table editor should fill up with a four-column table of parameters
from the eye curve.
Press
the <b>Read</b> button again, and this time select <b>from curve
spl_path2</b>. On the input request window, enable <b>Add Columns</b>
mode, and next to the <b>which columns</b> label enter <code>1-3</code>.
This will take columns 1,2 and 3 of the path and add them to the right
of the existing columns of the table editor.
Column 0 of spl_path is the time column, which
is not needed since the table editor already has a time column is
already present. If all has gone
well, there should be seven columns in every row of the table - these
are time, three eye columns, and three path columns.
<p>
Go back to the view animation window, and choose <b>table editor</b>
from the <b>Source</b> option menu. Type the integer identifier of the
table editor you just used in the corresponding entry box. Delete any
values in the <b>Object center</b>, <b>Object yaw, pitch, roll</b>,
<b>Eye point</b>, and <b>Eye yaw, pitch, roll</b> entries. Select <b>Eye
path and look-at path</b> from the orientation control section, and
press <b>OK</b> to create the new view script. Combine the view script
with foo.script, and show the resulting script. The eye should move
steadily along the edge of the platform as it watches the flying cone.
<p>
<h2><a name="EVCurves">Editing View Curves</a></h2>
A third useful method for view animation is interpolating between
saved views. A series of views can be saved in a view curve, much as a
series of points can be stored in an ordinary curves.
Select
<b>VIEW EDITOR</b> from the main menu to pop up the
<a href="./vceditor.gif">view editor window</a>.

<p>
The view editor is similar in many ways to the curve editor.
The name of the current view curve, displayed next to the <b>Current
v-curve</b> label, is initially "view".
By pressing
the <b>ADD</b> button, you insert the display's view parameters
after the current
node of the view curve. <b>INSERT</b> inserts the display's view
parameters before
the current node, <b>MOVE</b> overwrites the current node with the
display's view parameters, and <b>DELETE</b> deletes the current node.
<p>
Once you have stored a set a views in a view curve, you can interpolate
between them to create a complete view animation table. Interpolating
between orientations is more complicated then interpolating between
positions.
<p>
To get experience with view interpolation, you first need to create a
suitable view curve.
Center the display on the small white sphere (light.r),
and select a right view. Zoom in or out if necessary so the moss world
objects fill most of the screen.
Press the <b>ADD</b> button to make this the first view in the
view curve. Next select a top view,
and press <b>ADD</b> again. At the MGED prompt, type:
<pre>
mged> <b>vrot 0 -90 0</b>
</pre>
Press <b>Add</b> again. Finally, select the right view again, and press
<b>ADD</b> a fourth time.
To step visually through the
views you stored, enable the <b>Apply current node to view</b>
checkbutton. With this button enabled, the display always reflects the
view saved in the current node. Step back and forth between the saved views
using the left and right arrow buttons.
<p>
The views in the view curve are stored as lists of view parameters.
The particular combination of parameters stored in a given view curve
are listed next to the <b>Parameters</b> label;
by default, the parameters are <b>size</b> (viewsize), <b>eye</b> (the three
coordinates of the eye point), and <b>quat</b> (four quaternion
orientation coordinates). To see the view curve contents, click on the
name of the
the current view curve, which is displayed next to the <b>Current
v-curve</b> label. The
<a href="./vcdwidget.gif">view curve display window</a>
which pops up is similar
to a
table editor, except that the text can't be edited, and there are
fewer functions in the menu bar on the bottom line. Each row of the
table corresponds to one of the saved views, and each column corresponds to
one of the current view parameters.
In this case, the
first column is time, the next is the viewsize, the next three are the
eye point, and the last four are a quaternion.
The row of the table
corresponding to the current node is always highlighted.
<p>
Back in the view editor
window, press the <b>Parameters</b> button and examine the posted menu.
There are five different view parameter combinations to choose from.
Select <b>size eye ypr</b>. Note that the last four columns in the
view curve, representing the orientation as a quaternion,
 are automatically converted to three columns representing the
orientation as yaw, pitch, and roll.
<p>
<h2><a name="MTEFVCurves">Making the Eye Follow View Curves</a></h2>
Next you will create a view animation script using your view curve as a
basis. Press the <b>Clone</b> button on the view curve display window.
This creates a new table editor and loads it with the contents of the
view curve. Before creating the view animation script, you need to
smoothly interpolate your view curve.
Press the <b>Interpolate</b> button on the table editor to pop up a
<a href="tut5.gif">table interpolation window</a>.
<p>
Each entry at the top of the interpolator window represents a column of
the output table that will be produced. Each entry box should contain an
interpolation command, such as spline or linear. All of the possible
interpolation commands are listed when you post the <b>Active
Command</b> menu. If the  command <code>spline 1</code> were placed in
entry box 2, that would mean that column 1
of the input table will be spline interpolated and placed in column 2
of the output table. By default, AnimMate spline-interpolates
all of the columns of the input table.
Since the viewsize, eye point, and yaw, pitch, and roll can all
be spline interpolated, the default entries are exactly what you want.
The start
and end times for the interpolation are by default set to the start and
end times for the input table.
Press <b>OK</b> to do the
interpolation.
<p>
Go back to the view animation window, and identify as the source the table editor you
just interpolated. Enable <b>Rotation specified as ypr</b> and
<b>Read viewsize from source</b>. The label below the <b>Source</b>
label should read <b>8 input columns needed: t v x y z y p r</b>. These
are the columns of the view curve: time, viewsize, x, y, and z
coordinates, yaw, pitch, and roll. Press <b>OK</b> to create the script,
and then show it. The view should move smoothly between the views you
saved in the view curve.
<p>
When interpolating between orientations, quaternion interpolation
sometimes
produces better results than interpolating yaw, pitch, and roll. You can
create another view script using quaternion interpolation to see the
difference.
Go back to the view editor and select <b>size eye quat</b> from the
<b>Parameters</b> menu. Next, go back to a table editor and select
<b>from v-curve view</b> from the <b>Read</b> menu. Read in all the
columns, using <b>Replace</b> mode. Then press the <b>Interpolate</b>
button. Although the view size and eye point can be interpolated with
spline interpolation, the quaternions must be interpolated with a
special quaternion interpolator.
Select <b>Quaternion (src)</b> from the <b>Active Command</b> menu, and
then click on the column labels for entry boxes 5 through 8. This
replaces
the interpolation command <code>spline</code> with
<code>quat</code>, for columns five through eight.
Then press <b>OK</b> to do the interpolation.
<p>
Go
back to the view animation window, and enable <b>Rotation specified as
quat</b>. Change the name of the <b>Output file</b> to view2.script, so
that you can compare the new script with the previous one. Create and
show the new script.
<p>
Take a few moments to compare the animations produced by
<code>view.script</code> and  <code>view2.script</code>..
In the script created with yaw,
pitch, and roll, notice how far the view center strays from the small white
sphere after passing through the top view.
This is an indication that the orientation is swinging too wildly
between the views you specified.
Quaternion interpolation
usually avoids problems of this type. On the other hand, yaw, pitch, and roll
interpolation usually works fine in situations where the roll values
remain small and vertical views such as the top view are avoided.
<p>
Whether or not you use quaternions, you can fix the center of the view
exactly to a given point in the following way. Go back to the table
editor you used for the quaternion interpolation and press the <b>Edit
Columns</b> button. There should be nine entry windows, labeled from
zero to eight, representing the time, viewsize, eye position, and
quaternion orientation. In the entry windows labeled 2, 3, and 4, type
<code>20</code>, <code>-13.5</code>, and <code>5.0</code>
respectively. These are the approximate coordinates of the small white
shere. Press <b>OK</b> to replace the eye path with those constant
values. Next, go to the view animation window. You will use the <b>Eye
point</b> entry box to set the eye back a certain distance from the
white sphere. Note the viewsize from the second column of the table
editor, divide this number in half, negate it, and enter
the result followed by two space-separated zeros in
the <b>Eye point</b> entry box. (The distance from the eye to the center
point is always one half the viewsize.) For example, if you used a
viewsize of 200 in the second column of the table editor, then you would
enter <code>-100 0 0</code>. This puts the eye 100mm behind the
invisible tripod, which is being firmly attached to the small white
sphere. Make sure that the correct table editor is identified as the
source. Enable <b>Rotation specified as quat</b>, and press <b>OK</b> to
create the script. When you show the script now, the white sphere should
remain fixed in the center of the screen.
<p>

Go back to the view editor window and post the <b>Parameters menu</b>.
The last combination on the list, <b>eye center</b>, is different from
the others because it always stores a "right-side up" view. The eye
point and view center are not quite enough to completely specify the
view, which is still free to twist around the axis defined by those two
points. To resolve the ambiguity, AnimMate always selects a
right-side up view when a
center point and eye point are stored in a view curve.
Select <b>eye center</b> to convert the view
curve to that format. Enable <b>Apply current node to view</b> and step
back and forth through the saved views. Notice that all of the views are
now "right-side up". Note also that the second view in the view curve is
probably no longer a normal top view. The <b>eye center</b> orientation
is ill-conditioned when the axis they define is nearly vertical, because
slight floating point errors in the coordinates can cause big changes in
the resulting orientation.
<p>
Disable <b>Apply current node to view</b> and execute the command:
<pre>
mged> <b>ae -90 80</b>
</pre>
This is close to a top view, but not close enough to cause ill-
conditioning problems. Use the view editor arrow buttons to
make node 1 of the view curve current, and press <b>MOVE</b> to
overwrite node 1 with the current view.
Go back to a table editor and read in the new view curve, replacing the
old editor contents. Press the <b>Interpolate</b> button and then
<b>OK</b> to spline interpolate the eye point and center point. Go back
to the view animation window and select <b>Eye path and look-at path</b>
in the orientation controls. Make sure that the correct table editor is
identified as the source for the view animation.
Click on the <b>Eye point</b> entry box with the left mouse and use
the keyboard sequence <code>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-a &lt;Ctrl&gt;-k</code> to delete the
contents of that line. Now re-create and show the view script.
Note that the view always stays perfectly centered
on the small white sphere, and the view is always right-side up.
The <b>eye center</b> interpolation method is
probably the best in view animations where only right-side up views are
wanted.
<p>
At this point, you have all the tools you need to use AnimMate for a
variety of object and view animations. The last and final section of
this tutorial introduces a specialized tool for animating vehicles with
articulated tracks. You might also be interested in the
<a href="./rt_tut.html">appendix</a>, which
offers some hints on ray-tracing your animation scripts.
