<h1><a name="top">Animating Objects</a></h1>
In this section of the tutorial, you will animate the moss world
objects. In the previous section, you opened the geometry database
<var>moss.g</var> with MGED. If you have not done so yet, display the moss
world objects as follows:
<pre>
mged> <b>e all.g</b>
</pre>
When animating an object, you need to decide where you want the object to
go and what orientation it should have. The position is usually more
straightforward than the orientation.
<p>
<h2><a name="EACurves"> Editing Animation Curves</a></h2>
One of the most convenient ways to specify an object's path through
space is with AnimMate's curve editor. Select <b>Curve Editor</b> from
AnimMate's main menu to pop up the
<a href="ceditor.gif">curve editor window</a>.
<p>
Click on the <b>ADD</b> button, and a cyan cross should appear
in the center of the mged display. Use the middle mouse button to center
the display on another point,
and then click the <b>ADD</b> button
again. The cyan cross should move to the center of the display, and a
yellow line should connect the previous center point to the current one.
You have created a curve consisting of two points.
<p>
Curves in AnimMate are simply lists of points in space with associated
time parameters. The time parameter and point together are called a
node. Curves are displayed by line segments connecting all the
points. The curve editor allows you to edit curves in several ways,
interpolate them to create smoother curves, and read and write them to
files.
<p>
When a curve is being edited, one node is always considered the current
node.
Near the top of the curve editor should be the text: <b> Node 1 of
2</b>, meaning that the current node is node number 1 and that there are
two nodes in the current curve. Nodes are numbered beginning with zero,
so node 1 is actually the second node in the list.
The time parameter of node 1 is 1.0, and its position is marked by the
cyan cross. Next, click on the smaller left-arrow. This decrements the index
of the current node, which becomes zero. Notice that the position of node
zero is now marked by the cyan cursor, and that the time parameter of
the first node is 0.0.
<p>
As you may have realized, the center point of the MGED display is
important to the curve editor. This is the active point which is added
or inserted into the list when those buttons are activated, or the point
to which the current node is moved when the <b>MOVE</b> button is
activated.
Play around with the curve editor buttons. Note that the
<b>ADD</b> button inserts points into the curve just after the current
node, while the <b>INSERT</b> button inserts points just before the
current curve. The <b>MOVE</b> button moves the current node to the
current display center point, and the <b>DELETE</b> button deletes the
current node.
<p>
Next, you will create a curve and use it to animate the magenta cone.
The name of the curve you have been editing so far was called
<b>vdraw</b>. Open a new curve by clicking on the <b>Current curve</b>
label, and then selecting <b>New Curve</b> from the posted menu. A
pop-up window asks for the name for the new curve - enter
<code>path</code> into the entry box and hit return.
The new curve name should appear next to the <b>Current curve</b> label.
<p>
You will want to make the cone fly through the center of the torus.
Center the display on a point along the bottom
edge of the large square platform, as seen from the top view,
and press the <b>ADD</b> button. Then
center the display on the center of the yellow torus, and press the
<b>ADD</b> button again. Center the display on a point on the other side
of the torus, and press the button again. Two yellow line segments
should now connect the three points you selected. Change the color to
green
by clicking on the <b>Color</b> label, then selecting <b>Current
curve</b> from the posted menu, then selecting <b>green</b> from the
posted color list.
<p>
The next step is to interpolate the curve. Press the <b>Spline
Interpolate</b> button. A
<a href="tut1.png">smooth yellow curve</a> appears connecting the
three points of your original curve. Although it looks smooth, it
also consists of straight line segments. The difference is
that the new curve has 10 points for every second of time. The name of
the new curve, <code>spl_path</code>, is found next to the <b>into
curve</b> label. You can experiment with editing the nodes of
<code>path</code> and re-interpolating until <code>spl_path</code> takes
on a pleasing shape.
<p>
<h2><a name="MOFACurves"> Making Objects Follow Animation Curves</a></h2>
The next step is to make the cone follow the path you've described with
<code>spl_path</code>. If the main menu is hidden from view, raise it to
the top of the window stack by clicking on the curve editor's
<b>Up</b> button. Click on the <b>CREATE SCRIPT</b> button and select
<b>Object</b> from the posted menu to pop up the
<a href="oscript.gif">object animation window</a>.
<p>
Fill in the entry boxes from top to bottom. The output file defaults to
foo.script - this is the name of the file the script will be written
into. On the next line, labeled <b>Source curve</b>, enter
<code>spl_path</code>, the name of the curve specifying the desired
path. The <b>Object name</b> should be <code>all.g/cone.r</code>. This is the
name of the magenta cone which is to be animated and its immediate
parent. Although the name <code>cone.r</code> would also work in this
case, in general it's best to include the name of a parent to avoid
confusion. If cone.r were being displayed at the top level (ie by itself
and not as part of all.g), then the name <code>/cone.r</code> would be
used.
<p>
Leave the rest of the
entries with their default values and click on the
<b>OK</b> button to create the script.
From a shell window, take a look at foo.script. It should look something
like the following:
<pre>
%> <b>head -n 20 foo.script</b>
start 0;
clean;
anim all.g/cone.r matrix lmul
1 0 0 21.4994
0 1 0 -69.5377
0 0 1 -20.2931
0 0 0 1;
end;
start 1;
clean;
anim all.g/cone.r matrix lmul
1 0 0 19.4385
0 1 0 -65.7729
0 0 1 -13.7696
0 0 0 1;
end;
start 2;
clean;
anim all.g/cone.r matrix lmul
1 0 0 17.4095
</pre>
This file demonstrates the basic format of all animation scripts. There
is a start
command for each frame, followed by a clean command. Then there are are
number of animation commands. In this case, there is just one anim
command which applies the given matrix to the object cone.r in each
frame. Note that
in this case, the matrix is only a translation matrix, with no rotation.
Finally each frame is terminated with an end command.
<p>
To view the results of this animation, click on the <b>Show Script</b>
button to pop up
<a href="sscripts.gif">the corresponding window</a>.
The entry box labeled <b>Script file</b> should already be filled in
with the name of the script file you just created. Make sure that the
MGED display window is visible, and press the <b>Show</b> button.
<p>
The magenta cone should move in a smooth curve. However, you should
notice that the path that the cone follows is offset from the path you
specified. This is is because you didn't fill out the <b>Object
center</b> box, which tells AnimMate where the object initially is in
the model. Since AnimMate thinks the cone is originally at the point
(0,0,0), the translations it applies are incorrect.
Of course this isn't your fault - you
were just following instructions.
<p>
Before going back to correct this problem, note that the display left
the cone where it stopped in the last frame of the animation.
Return it to its true modeled position by pressing the <b>Restore</b>
button. Although showing animation scripts causes the displayed
position of an object to change, the actual modeled position of the
object is never changed by animation commands. To display an object in
its true position, you can always use the <b>Restore</b> button or
MGED's "e" command.
<p>
Now go back to the <b>CREATE OBJECT SCRIPT</b>
window. Center the MGED display on the center of the cone by clicking on
the cone center with the middle mouse button. Be sure to verify the
centering from the top and right views to make sure the view is centered
in three dimensions. When the view is centered on the cone, press the
<b>Object center</b> button to automatically fill in the entry box with
the coordinates of the center point you selected. Now press <b>OK</b>
again to recreate the script. AnimMate will probably warn that the file
foo.script already exists; go ahead and overwrite the file. Again make
sure that the MGED display is visible, and press the <b>Show</b> button
on the <b>SHOW SCRIPTS</b> window again. This time, the magenta cone
should follow the path specified by spl_path. Watch the animation from
several different views to get a feel for the full three dimensional
motion.
<p>
<h2><a name="OControl">Orientation Control</a></h2>
You may have noticed on the CREATE OBJECT ANIMATION window that the
checkbutton <b>No Rotation</b> was selected as the default under the
<b>Orientation Control</b> section. Many other options are available.
Enable the <b>Automatic steering</b> button by clicking with the mouse.
This option will turn the front of the object to always face the
direction of motion. But what is the front of the object? By default, it
is assumed that the front of an object faces the x-axis, with the y-axis
to its left and the z-axis going up.
To specify any other object orientation, you give the yaw, pitch, and
roll which must be applied to an object in the default orientation in
order to put it into it's actual orientation.
<p>
In this case, let's designate the narrow end of the cone to be the
front, and designate its up direction to be perpendicular to the long
axis of the ellipse at the narrow end. If
the cone were in the default orientation, with the narrow end facing the
x-axis, and the long axis of the ellipse lying flat, it would have to
yaw 45 degrees and then pitch up 90 degrees to get to its current
orientation.
<a name="oypr">Enter</a> the numbers <code>45 90 0</code> into the <b>Object
yaw, pitch, roll</b> entry box, and press the <b>OK</b> button to
recreate the script. This time, when you show the script, the cone
should move point-first along its trajectory.
<p>
Another option on the Orientation control section is automatic steering
and banking. To demonstrate this effectively, it might be a good idea to
add another point or two to the path. Go back to the <b>Curve Editor</b>
window and
make sure that the curve
"path" is selected. Press the right arrow button until the last node
of the curve is current. Then
add one or two more points in a zig-zag fashion so that the path curve
bends one way and then another.
Press the <b>Spline Interpolate</b> button to update the
<a href="tut2.png">interpolation curve</a>.
<p>
Now go back to the <b>CREATE OBJECT SCRIPT</b> window and select
<b>Automatic steering and banking</b>. Press the <b>OK</b> button to
recreate foo.script. When you show this script the cone should "fly"
along the curve, banking into the turns like an aircraft would.
<p>
<h2><a name="MTTParameter">Manipulating the Time Parameter</a></h2>
So far you have concentrated on the spatial aspects of the animation
without giving much thought to the time. The next step is to look at
methods of using the time parameter of the animation to your advantage.
<p>
Depending on the shape of the path curve that you picked, you may have
discovered that the interpolating spline curve varied widely in places
from the path you had intended. This effect is especially strong when
the distribution of the curve nodes through space doesn't match their
distribution through time.
When a curve is
first created, AnimMate spaces the nodes of the curve evenly through
time at one-second intervals. This works well only if the nodes are
evenly distributed through space.
<p>
To see more clearly the effects that poor time
parameters can have, go back to the curve editor and make node 1 of the
path curve current. The time parameter of this node, visible next to the
<b>Time</b> label, should be "1.0". Click on the time parameter with the
left mouse button, and then key-board edit the entry to read
<code>0.3</code>. This moves this node much closer in time to node 0 and
farther from node 2. Be sure to press the <b>Return</b> key to apply the
new time parameter to the curve.
Change the name of the interpolation curve to
<code>spl_path2</code> and press <b>Spline Interpolate</b> to create a
new interpolation curve. Use the <b>Current Spline</b> option in the
<b>Color</b> menu to color spl_path2 red, to help make the new curve
visible.
You should see that spl_path2 strays far from the path
curve between nodes 1 and 2.
<p>
Trying to choose the best time parameters for curve nodes
can be difficult and tedious. Fortunately, the table editor
contains a tool
which helps to automate the process.
Press the <b>Up</b> button on one of the windows to pop the main menu to
the top of the window stack, and select <b>Table Editor</b>. Select
<b>New editor</b>, the only option on the posted menu.
<p>
A large
<a href="./teditor.gif">table editor window</a>
 should appear. The purpose of this window is
to allow you to edit animation tables, which are tables of data in which
the columns represent animation parameters and the rows represent
animation frames. When it first pops up, the table editor is by default
filled in with the contents of the current curve. There is one row for
each node of the curve, and there are four columns representing the
time and the x, y, and z coordinates of each node.
Note that the times for each node are evenly spaced at one second
intervals, except for node 1 which you just modified.
<p>
Click on the
table editor's <b>Estimate Time</b> button to pop up the
<a href="etime.gif">time estimator window</a>
<p>
The time estimator window uses the distances between curve nodes to
estimate the best time parameter for each node. It always assumes that
the first column of the table editor is the time column, and that the
first and last rows in the time column are the desired starting and
ending time. Three other columns of the table, listed in the <b>Path
Columns</b> entry box, specify a path which will be used as a basis for
the estimation. The other two entry boxes allow you to specify the
starting and ending speeds of the object's motion. Speeds specified with
percentages are relative to the speed that would move the object along
the path at a constant rate. Thus if both the starting and ending speeds
are <code>100%</code>, then the object moves at a constant rate
throughout. These are the default values - press the <b>OK</b> button to
accept them.
<p>
Look at the first column of the animation table in the table editor, and
Note that the time parameters are no
longer evenly spaced - they have been changed to reflect the distances
between the points.
To apply the new time parameters to the path curve, click on the table
editor's <b>Write</b> button, and then select <b>to Curve</b> from the
posted menu. An pop-up window should ask if you want
to write <code>all</code> columns to the <code>path</code> curve. Press
<b>OK</b>, and the path curve is updated. Press
<b>Spline Interpolate</b> to recreate spl_path2 using the new time
parameters. The curve should now fit the original path much better.
<p>
Now, go back to the table editor and click on <b>Estimate Time</b>
again. This time, enter an absolute speed of <code>0</code> for both the
starting and ending speeds. This means that the object will start and
end at rest, accelerating at the beginning and decelerating at the end.
Write the new parameters back to the path curve using the <b>Write</b>
button. Go back to the curve editor and change the interpolation curve
name to <code>spl_path3</code>, then redo the interpolation. This time
the interpolation curve may not fit the path curve as closely,
particularly near the beginning and end. However, when you use spl_path3
to animate the cone, it should appear to start slowly, accelerate, and
then slow at the end of its motion.
Go back to the object animation window and change the name of the source
curve to <code>spl_path3</code> before recreating and showing
foo.script.
<p>
Besides helping to control the speed of animated objects,
time estimation can give you the freedom to put nodes closer together
in sections of the path which require the most control, and to space
them widely in other areas. For example, if you are particular about the
direction that you want an object to move at a certain point, it is a
good idea to put two closely spaced nodes which define the direction
at that point. You can use this technique to make the cone fly
perpendicularly through the torus.
<p>
Go back to the curve editor and make
sure that the path curve is current. Use
the arrow buttons to make node 1, the node in the center of the
torus, the
current node.
Center the display on the postion of node 1, making sure that you check
the centering from at least two orthogonal views. Go to a top view, and
use the MGED's yslew slider to move the display center to the
edge of the torus closest to the top of the screen. Press the curve
editor's <b>ADD</b>button to add this point to the curve.
Now nodes 1 and 2 should define a straight line perpendicular
to the center of the torus.
<p>
Go back to the table editor, and read in the current state of the path
curve by pressing the <b>Read</b> button and selecting <b>from path
curve</b> from the menu that appears. Press <b>Estimate Time</b> and
make sure that the Start and End speeds are both zero before pressing
<b>OK</b>. Note that the new time parameters for nodes 1 and 2 are
close together, reflecting their closeness in space. Write the new
values back to the path curve with the <b>Write</b> button, and then go
back to the curve editor to re-create the interpolation curve.
Go back to the object animation window and recreate and show foo.script.
The cone should fly perpendicularly through the torus.
<p>
Because you selected zero start and end speeds during the time
estimation, the cone should appear to start from rest, accelerate, and
then slow down at the end of its motion. If this is difficult to see,
the problem may be that the interpolation curve and the original curve
being interpolated are too different.
The closer that the length of the interpolation curve is to the length
of  the  path
curve, the more accurate the time estimation values are, and the greater
control you have over the speed of the object. For example, if spl_path3
varies widely from the path curve in some sections, you may get better
control over the speed of the object by adding another node or two
to the path curve in that section. If you do this, don't forget to redo
the time estimation step before re-interpolating spl_path3.
<p>
One other trick of the trade to keep in mind is you may need three
closely spaced nodes, rather than two, in order to define a direction of
motion at the beginning or end of an object's path.

<h2><a name="RDAOrientation">Relative Displacement and Orientation</a></h2>
Backtracking a little bit to the object animation window, the next
step will demonstrate the <b>Relative Displacement</b> and <b>Relative
Rotation</b> options.
Change the name of the <b>Output file</b> from <code>foo.script</code>
to <code>rel.script</code> so that <code>foo.script</code> is available
for later use.
<p>
You will use the table editor to create an
animation table for bobbing the cone sinusoidally up and down.
Go back to the table editor, and press <b>Clear</b> to empty the table.
Press the <b>Edit Columns</b> button to pop up the column editing
window.
On the column editor, press the <b>Add Column</b> button
three times to make three new entry boxes appear at the top of
<a href="tut4.gif">the window</a>.

<p>
Each entry box of the column editor corresponds to a column that will be
produced as output. The box may contain any valid Tcl expression, plus
some column editor substitutions associated with the <code>@</code>
symbol. Type <code>@i</code> in the first entry box, type
<code>@n</code> in the second, and type <code>4*@pi*@i/(@n-1)</code>
in
the third. In the entry labeled <b>Number of Rows</b>, type
<code>31</code>. Now press <b>OK</b> to create the table you specified.
<p>
The first column now contains the row index (substituted for @i), the second
column contains the number of rows in the table (substituted for @n).
The third column ranged linearly from zero to four times the
mathematical constant pi (substituted for @pi).
The other possible
substitutions are @e for the mathematical constant e, and @<i>k</i>, for
the contents of the <i>k</i>-th column.
<p>
Click on the <b>Edit Columns</b> button again. Note that the default
behavior of the window is for the output table to simply be a copy of
the input table. Add another column by pressing the <b>Add Column</b>
button. Type <code>@i*3/(@n-1)</code> into the first box, to create a
time column ranging from 0 to 3 seconds. Type <code>0</code> in the
second and third entry boxes, and type <code>5*sin(@2)</code> into the
fourth entry box, to create a column which varies sinusoidally between
5 and -5. Note that the
argument to the sine function will be taken from row 2 of the current
table for each row of the output column.
Leave the
<b>Number of rows</b> as <code>all</code> to keep the same number of
rows, and press the
<b>OK</b> button to create the new table.
<p>
Now we can create an animation based on this table. Go back to the
object script window and press down on the word <b>curve</b> in the
<b>Source curve</b> label. Use the posted option menu to select <b>table
editor</b>. The label should now read <b>Source table editor</b>.
In the corresponding entry box, remove the curve name
<code>spl_path2</code> and type in the integer which identifies the
table editor you have been using. (This integer is displayed on the top
line of the table editor.)
Now the animation table driving the script will come
directly from the table editor. Change the orientation control to
<b>No Rotation</b> and press <b>OK</b> to create the script. When you
show the script, you should see the magenta cone bobbing up and down at the
origin. Note that the front of the cone, as defined by <b>Object yaw,
pitch, roll</b>, lies in the default position (facing the x-axis)
when no rotation is
specified.
<p>
To make the cone bob up and down in place, select <b>Relative
Displacement</b>. Now the displacements in the table editor are
considered to be relative to the object center. Recreate and show the
new script. The object bobs up and down in place, although the
orientation is still changed to face the x-axis.
<p>
Now enable <b>Relative Orientation</b> as well. In this mode, all
displacements and orientations are considered relative to the object's
own axes, as defined by <b>Object yaw, pitch, roll</b>. Note that the
object now moves "up and down" relative to its own coordinate system.
To see that orientations are also relative to the object's own
orientation, go back to the table editor and pop up the column editor.
Press the <b>Add Column</b> button three time and enter
<code>@0*120</code> into the first new column entry box next to the
label <b>4:</b>. Enter <code>0</code>
into entry boxes <b>5:</b> and <b>6:</b>, and press <b>OK</b>
to add the three new
columns.
<p>
These columns represent yaw, pitch, and roll for the cone. The
yaw column will cause the cone to yaw through 360 degrees during the
animation. Go back to the object
script window and select <b>Rotation specified as ypr</b> from the
orientation controls section. Note that the column description label
near the top of the window changes to <b>7 input columns needed: t x y z
y p r</b>, meaning that the source table should specify time, x,y, and z
coordinates, yaw, pitch, and roll. Create and show this script. Note
that both the "up and down" motion and the yaw are relative to the
cone's own coordinate system.
<p>
Now that you've mastered object animation, it's time to move on to the
view.
