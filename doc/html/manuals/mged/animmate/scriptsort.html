<h1>NAME</h1>
scriptsort - sort an animation script or scripts
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<b>scriptsort</b>
[<b>-fsq</b>]
[<b>-b</b>base]
[<b>-o</b>frame_offset]
&lt; unsorted.script
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<i>Scriptsort</i>
reads an <i>rt</i> animation script from standard input and sorts the
frames into the desired order. Typical uses include combining separate
scripts into one script, or changing the frame order of an existing script.
<p>
<i>Scriptsort</i>
organizes the input script into three different categories.
The first category consists of
numbered frames. Each frame begins with a
<b>start </b>
<i>frame_num</i>;
command, and ends with an
<b>end</b>;
command. All of the text between those two commands makes up the body of
the frame. When two frames with the same frame number are found in the
input, they are merged into a single frame. The body of the merged frame
is the concatenation of the two original frames, except that only one
<b>clean</b>;
command is ever printed in a single frame.
<p>
The second category consists of shell commands. Any line in the
animation script which is not inside a frame and which begins with an
exclamation mark is considered to be a shell command.
Typically, each frame of an animation script might have an associated
shell command following it to process the image just computed.
The third category
is "everything else". These are assumed to be global animation commands that
don't belong to any frame and should be executed before the first frame.
<p>
Once the input has been sorted by category, output is produced according
to the following method. First, all of the global animation commands
that didn't belong to any frame are printed. Next,
<i>scriptsort </i>
determines the order in which to print the frames. This
might be in ascending numerical order, or in a scrambled order which
incrementally increases the time resolution of the script, depending on
the
<b>-b </b>
option. Then
<i>scriptsort </i>
prints the frames in order. After each frame, the
shell command
<pre>
!end_of_frame.sh <i>frame_num</i>
</pre>
is added if any of the input frames which contributed to the frame had
an associated shell command. When the animation script is run
as input to
<i>rt,</i>
the user should create a shell script called "end_of_frame.sh" to
perform any desired shell commands. The argument to "end_of_frame.sh" is
the frame number.
<p>
The order in which the frames are printed out depends on an integer
called the base integer, which must always be a power of two. By
default, the base integer is one, in which case the frames are listed
in order of increasing frame number. Larger powers of two cause the
frames to be ordered in such a way that the time resolution of the
animation script is incrementally increased. For example, an animation
script sorted with a base
integer of four calculates every fourth frame on the first
pass, all of the remaining even frames on the second
pass, and all of the odd frames on the final pass.
<p>
The following algorithm defines the order corresponding to a given base
integer:
<dl><dt>
1. List all of the frames in order of increasing frame

<dd>
number. Then give each frame an index according to its position in the
list. For example, if there are 61 frames numbered from 45 to 105, then the
index of frame 45 is 0, and the index of frame 105 is 60.
<dt>
2. Print all of the frames whose indexes are multiples of the base

<dd>
integer, beginning with the frame indexed by zero.
<dt>
3. If the base integer is one, stop here. Otherwise, go to step 4.

<dd>
<dt>
4. Divide the base integer in half and print all of the frames whose

<dd>
indexes are odd multiples of the new base integer. Go to step 3.
</dl>
<p>
The base integer can be set to any power of two with the
<b>-b#</b>
option. To automatically select the largest possible base integer for
a given script, a non-positive argument should be used.
If the specified integer is positive but is not a power of two, then a
warning is printed and the integer is set to one, the default value.
<h1>OTHER OPTIONS</h1>
<dl><dt>
<b>-f</b>

<dd>
forces a shell command to be printed after every frame, regardless of
whether or not shell commands were found in the input script.
<dt>
<b>-s</b>

<dd>
suppresses shell commands. No shell commands are printed, regardless of
whether or not shell commands were found in the input script.
<dt>
<b>-q</b>

<dd>
enables quiet mode. The status messages normally printed on standard
error are suppressed.
<dt>
<b>-o </b>

<dd>
frame_offset specifies an integer which should be added to all of the frame
numbers. For example, suppose that the user wants to concatenate
two animation scripts which begin at frame zero and are 300 frames long.
He or she should run one script through
<i>scriptsort</i>
with an offset of 300 before doing the concatenation.
