<p>
To our Air Force and Navy users:  good news! ARL has been authorized to
directly distribute the "BURST" code (see attachment).  BURST provides
FASTGEN3 and FASTGEN4 ray files from BRL-CAD geometry files.

<p>
BURST will be a standard item in the next full BRL-CAD distribution.  If
you require a version of BURST for use with BRL-CAD Release 4.4, please
drop a line to John Anderson &lt;jra@arl.mil&gt; or FAX 410-278-5058 to alert
him to your need.  I imagine that as an interim measure we will provide
a supplemental encrypted TAR file on the anonymous FTP server as our
primary means of making this software available to the community.

<p>
Please join me in saying a warm "Thank-You" to Mr. Stovall!

	Recently, the CHICKEN LITTLE program office has received 
another request for the "burst" code.  We have reassessed our
previous need to maintain control over this code and have
determined that it would be in the best interests of the 
DOD Vulnerability/Lethality community to release control of
this code to you for inclusion and distribution with the
BRL-CAD package if you see fit.  If you have any questions,
please contact me at DSN 872-9243 [(904) 882-9243) or my technical 
representative, Mr. Bud Bruenning, (904) 729-6497.

Mike,
	This is perhaps an oversimplification. ;-)  BURST provides Shotline
files and Burst Point Library files which contain the same information used
by the PDAM code and previously provided by PGEN from FASTGEN descriptions.
In any case, the format of BURST's output files are syntactically different,
so a conversion is necessary to read them from codes like PDAM.  The file
burst/burst.format describes the file formats so that it is straightforward
to write a Fortran or C routine to read them.  They are much easier to for
a human to read than the compressed Fortran format previously used.

&gt; When attempting to select a region in "Object Illum", we get an error
&gt; message in mged that says:
&gt; 
&gt; rt_id_solid: u_id=x43
&gt; rt_nul_import unimplemented
&gt; init_objedit(&lt;region name&gt;)
&gt; 
&gt; The sequence ALWAYS occurs when we do the following in mged:
&gt; 
&gt; E &lt;region name&gt;
&gt; E: &lt;n&gt; vectors in &lt;m&gt; sec
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Then select "Object Illum"
&gt; highlight the region, select with the middle mouse button.
&gt; 
&gt; Are we doing something wrong, though. Perhaps we shouldn't be editing
&gt; using E instead of e, or...?

<p>
Yes, editing only works if you view the object using the "e" command.
The "E" command and the "ev" command evaluate things below the region
level, and are not compatible with either Solid or Object editing.

<p>
I admit that it isn't a good error message.  Formerly there was a better
message, someone needs to find out why it no longer prints.  Probably
some new checking code got inserted before the old checking code.

<p>
Glenn,
  The messages you are getting are from 'rld' the run time linker
which resolves dynamic shared objects. Under Irix5* the default
build uses shared libraries, which will really save you a lot of
disk space. The BRLCAD4.4 should be adding the '-rpath' option on
the link command followed by a path specifying where to find the 
DSO's. Check to make sure that this this option is being used and
if so, check to make sure the path looks correct. If this option
is not being used run the the 'sh machinetype.sh -v' script and make
sure your machine is being recognized as 'MACHINE=6d'. If the path
looks incorrect check the setting of LIBDIR in 'Cakefile.defs'.
If you are not installing in the default '/usr/brlcad' directory
make sure to run the 'newbindir.sh' script which will replace
'/usr/brlcad' with new correct install location in several places
including 'Cakefile.defs'.
  Using the '-rpath' option on the load command puts the DSO 
resolve path in the executable so be sure not to move your libraries
after the build. There are other ways to tell 'rld' where to
look but I think fixing the install is the best approach.

I am trying to get BRL-CAD running on a SUN SPARC 10 running SunOS 4.3.1. 
The program compiles without any errors and mged works without any 
trouble. I can create models with mged. I can ray-trace the models 
without errors but when I try to display the pix file in the frame buffer 
I get the following error:

<p>
	fb_open (0x8c70, "/dev/debug", 1024, 1024)
	fb_write (0x8c70,   0,    0,   0x8d50, 1024)
the last line is repeated for every line in the pix file.

<p>
any suggestions about this problem.

&gt; We have been using the ProE to BRL converter in the latest release of
&gt; the BRL-CAD package, and greatly appreciate its being included.  Now
&gt; the question has arisen as to whether anyone has developed a
&gt; capability to import BRL models into ProE.

<p>
Not yet, but I hope to provide such a capability in the not too distant
future.

<p>
&gt; We got a ProE model of an airplane from one of the airframe
&gt; manufacturers, converted it to MGED, then added a number of internal
&gt; features.  We'd like to ship those internal features back to ProE,
&gt; without having to re-create them in ProE.  Has anyone written anything
&gt; to allow this to be done?
&gt; 
	You might try "g-iges" and then try importing the IGES file into
Pro-Engineer. That won't work on the version of Pro/E that I am running
(I still have version 13!!!), it expects only surface files, not solid models.
If Pro/E has improved its IGES capability beyond what was available in
version 13, there might be a chance.

&gt;1) Does XMGED support RIB output for RenderMan?

<p>
There is an outboard program to convert NMG solids
to RIB polygons.  It's called "nmg-rib".

<p>
&gt;2) Is there a port of XMGED for Linux boxes (without Motif)?

<p>
You'll have to run "mged".  XMGED requires MOTIF.

<p>
&gt;3) Are any models created for BRL-CAD available for viewing?
&gt;(Specifically, that Tank car on the BRL WWW pages look
&gt;really cool... and any other train-related ones?)

<p>
Look in the "db" directory of your distribution.  The ".asc" files there
can be turned into BRL-CAD binary databases using the asc-g program.

<p>
&gt;4) Since I am already a registered user of BRL-CAD, how can I
&gt;get the crypt key for the latest version?

<p>
I think your 4.0 decryption key will work on the 4.4 distribution.

	No. Actually, inches is the only output unit for RTG3.

<p>
&gt; If I call up a model inmged, and set the local units to inches,
&gt; then run the model through rtg3, will the line of sight thicknesses
&gt; for each ray trace be output in inches? Thanks.

<p>
	Yes. See above. Note that the "units" command in MGED only affects
what you see while running MGED. It specifies what units you want to work with
while using MGED with that particular model. The model is assumed to be stored
in mm and RTG3 uses a conversion factor to produce inches.

James,

<p>
You can fix this by adding

<p>
  XMged*fontList: fixed

<p>
to an Xresource file (i.e. .Xdefaults) and then using
"xrdb -load .Xdefaults" to load this info into the
X server. Or you can edit dm-X.h by changing the corresponding
value in the fallback_resources and then recompiling.

<p>
Brl-cad release 4.4 already has these modifications.
If you haven't already done so, I'd recommend getting the
latest release. I hope this helps.

&gt; I am familiar with creating BRLCAD models using the standard primitives.  I have

&gt; be created and edited in xmged?

<p>
	The NMG solids are still experimental and not fully supported yet. You can make
an NMG solid of extrusion in MGED. The same should work in XMGED, but I don't
think it does. Here is the procedure:

<p>
	After starting MGED, make a nearly empty NMG solid by "make s.nmg nmg".
Replace "s.nmg" with any solid name you like. Then use the mouse to select "Solid
Ilum" (or type "press sill"). This will get you into Solid Edit Mode. Then use the
middle mouse button to select your NMG solid (or type "ill s.nmg"). This selects
the new NMG solid for editing. Next, select "pick edge" from the Solid Edit
Menu and move the mouse to the MGED display window (not in the menu) and click
the middle mouse button. This selects the only edge in the newly created NMG.
Now select "split edge" from the Solid Edit Menu. You may now draw a loop of
edges by clicking the middle mouse button at the locations of the desired points
(or use the "p" command). The result is a closed loop of edges. You may continue
to select edges, split edges, deletes edges, and move edges until you have the
shape you desire. When you are satisfied with the loop you have created, you
can extrude it by changing your viewing direction and selecting "extrude loop".
Clicking the middle mouse button will extrude the loop to the selected point.
You may continue selecting different points until you are satisfied with the
final NMG solid. Then select "Accept Edit" (or "press accept").

<p>
&gt; Is there any documentation on creating
&gt; polysolids (I also seen reference to these)?  I am familiar with FASTGEN
&gt; triangles and SHAZAM points and faces.  Do they work in a similar manner?  I
&gt; have used patch-g to translate my FASTGEN models but I can't figure out how to
&gt; edit the resulting faceted components or how to add additional similar
&gt; components.

<p>
	There is no way in MGED to create a polysolid, but you can write
a program that uses "libwdb" to create polysolids. You would need the following
routines:
	mk_id() to create an ID record for the new model.
	mk_polysolid() to make a header record for the polysolid
	mk_poly() or mk_fpoly() to make each face.
See libwdb/poly.c for these routines. 

<p>
	The BRL-CAD polysolid is similar to the FASTGEN triangles in that
they both describe a solid by listing the vertices of planar faces. The
polysolid may have up to 5 vertices per face and does not have the sequencing
complication that FASTGEN triangular facets do. The polysolid faces must have their
vertices listed in CCW order (use the right-hand rule) so that the outward normal
is well defined.

<p>
&gt; Thanks,

	You're welcome. I hope this helps,

<p>
&gt; &gt; This is possible even in release 4.0, using the '-X80000000' option
&gt; &gt; to RT and sending the output to "pl-sgi" or to a file, and then
&gt; &gt; viewing with "pl-sgi" or with the "overlay" command in "mged".
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The platform that we are working on is Sun Sparc server 10, solaris 2.3.  I created a mged file trial.g containing a box and I tried to raytrace it using the following command:
&gt; 
&gt;     rt -a90 -e0 -s32 trial.g box &gt; output.pix 
&gt; 
&gt; Next, I tried to see the interception animation by typing
&gt;     pix-fb output.pix
&gt; 
&gt; I do not get an image file.  Instead, I got only lines of fb_open, fb_write and fb_close commands.  I had also tried viewing the pix file in mged using overlay command, but I still do not get any image.  Would appreciate very much if you could assist.

<p>
The problem here is that environment variable FB_FILE has not been
properly set.  Run "man brlcad" and read the section on FB_FILE.
Considering you are using Solaris, I suggest that you will get much
better results using the new versions of the display software in BRL-CAD
Release 4.4.

<p>
What this will show you is the optical image of the box.  In order
to see the ray history file, which is what I think you mean when you
say "interception animation", you need to do what I wrote earlier.
Try:

<p>
     rt -P1 -X80000000 -a90 -e0 -s32 -o output.pix trial.g box &gt; output.pl

<p>
Then view the ray history file in MGED like this:

<p>
	mged trial.g
	e box
	overlay output.pl

<p>
And then rotate the view as you please.

<p>
Best,

Message-ID:  &lt;9505030948.aa19404@WALRUS.ARL.MIL&gt;

<p>
Rick,

<p>
The problem isn't with the geometries having different codes, its the 
assessment models which use different codes.  For example ...

<p>
      MATERIAL      VAST         COVART            HEIVAM
      --------     ------       --------          --------
        1          steel        steel(BHN 100)    magnesium
        2          rha          steel(BHN 150)    aluminum
        3          fha          steel(BHN 200)    titanium
        4          cast iron    steel(BHN 250)    cast iron
        5          aluminum     steel(BHN 300)    fha
        6          magnesium    steel(BHN 350)    steel
        7          copper       titanium          rha
	etc.

<p>
So the material assigned in the target description is correct for a given 
assessment model but if another analyst wants to use that geometry with a 
different assessment model, all of the material code assignments must be 
checked against the alternate model's understanding of what a material code 
number of xx is.  This is also true for updated versions of assessment codes 
(COVART 4 brought HEVART and HEIVAM internally so the material definitions 
had to be made common).

<p>
This being the case, even with the ability to read the material ids from 
the geometry database, the codes must still be verified to match whatever 
assessment model is being used (and a conversion utility must still know 
what id table was used in the geometry so it knows what id numbers to swap 
to get to the desired id table).

<p>
Too good to pass up my two cents worth,

<p>

&gt; 
&gt; All the tcl/Tk demos work flawlessly.
&gt; 
&gt; What did I do wrong?

<p>
To try out the sample user interface, you need to do the following:
Find "tmged.tcl" (it should be in the tmged directory.  For this
example, we will assume it is in the subdirectory "../tmged").  
Then, at the mged&gt; prompt, type "source ../tmged/tmged.tcl" (or whatever
path is appropriate).  You should then get the sample interface (a
button menu and an interaction window).

<p>
The main reason the interface is not loaded automatically is that users
may wish to write their own, customized, interfaces in Tcl/Tk for use
in tmged.

<p>
If you want this to be loaded automatically each time you start tmged,
copy "tmged.tcl" to "~/.tmgedrc" (or put the "source foo/tmged.tcl" command
in your ~/.tmgedrc file).

<p>
Hope this helps,

This evening I got the prototype versions of RTSYNC and RTNODE running.
Right now I've got 3 systems with a total of 38 CPUs rendering the
viewpoint from my MGED session as fast as they can into a shared
framebuffer.  I'm getting about 0.5 frames/sec, at 512x512, and that
isn't close to the final number of CPUs....

<p>
I set the MGED to spinning, and it's really cool to watch the
framebuffer flipping up a new image every other second, fully ray-traced.

<p>
Until the HIPPI framebuffer gets installed, I think I'm going to be
Ethernet limited....  Ugh.

This should further improve our ability to drive MGED from TCL scripts.

The default bindings are for zoom-in and zoom-out as before, but
this new arrangement allows users to re-bind the mouse buttons as
they wish.  For example, to make all three buttons act as the middle
mouse has always done, these two commands would suffice:

The rtweight program is part of the distribution but it is not compiled
in the default configuration.  The reference program is in the "rt"
directory called "viewweight.c".  You will need to modify the cakefile
to compile the program.  It compiles and runs on the SGI without problem.

Rtweight was a piece of sample code to show one way that weights and
centroids can be calculated using librt.  It is not very "portably"
written and thus not part of a standard compile.  Find it under your

Message-ID:  &lt;9511302159.aa04906@WILSON.ARL.MIL&gt;

<p>

<p>
Today Paul Stay and I converted all the routines in LIBNURB over to
using the t-NURBS data structures from the NMG package.  Thus, all
"snurb" structures are now "face_g_snurb", and all "cnurb" structures
are now "edge_g_cnurb".

<p>
This means that routines in MGED and LIBRT can directly use the LIBNURB
routines for processing t-NURBS NMG objects.  This has been imporant
for us to have in furthering our trimmed-NURBS capability, and is
an (overdue) good thing to do.

<p>
For those of you who may have programmed using the old LIBNURB data
structures, when you get the new code (currently found only in the
development tree), you can use the attached "ed" script to convert
your code over to the new form.

<p>

<p>
I've updated the source to pixhalve, so that it now converts from
RGB to YUV, then applies a 3x3 filter to Y and a 5x5 filter to U and V,
so as to preserve the maximum amount of detail when the destination
is NTSC television, the main application of this tool.

<p>
It does make a difference, but for the Bradley image that I tried it on,
it's very subtle.  Perhaps in other images it will be more beneficial.
In any case, I'm leaving the code installed.

<p>

<p>
     I've created a new utility, called bary, to compute weighted sums of
points in 3-space.  You specify "sites" on the command line and then in
the input stream you give lines of one-weight-per-site.  It has options to
normalize the weights (thus giving you barycentric combinations of the
sites) and to copy unmolested any/all fields beyond the first three.
     The motivation was PHD's request for a ray-traced plot of unit cube
data into an equilateral triangle.  I can easily imagine other such
visualization applications where the tool would be of use.
     And, most surprising, it even has a man page.

The IGES5.1 support is designed for basic solid entities and for spline 
surfaces.  It will also import an IGES5.1 drawing entity (option -d) which 
you can position to use as a view template.  A minimum of two templates 
(front and side, top and side, back and bottom, etc.) are required to provide 
the l-w-h data for each of the solids you will build from the templates.  The 
templates if viewed from its "side" will be a single line (like the edge of 
a piece of paper) but from its "face" will provide a transparent line drawing 
guide (with dimensions if in the original IGES5.1 drawing).

<p>
	I have added a new command to MGED. The command is
"nmg_simplify" This takes an existing NMG solid and attempts to
represent it as a simpler BRL-CAD primitive and build that simpler
solid. Currently, it can recognize arb4's through arb8's and circular
cross section cones and cylinders. The syntax is:

<p>
	nmg_simplify [arb|tgc|poly] new_solid existing_nmg_solid

<p>
The default behavior is to attempt to build and arb first, if that is
not possible, it attempts a tgc, and if that is also not possible, the
last resort is to build a polysolid. If an optional arguement is
provided, then only that particular type of solid is attempted.

<p>
	This command was inspired by a request from Bill Hruz and 
uses routines developed for the Pro/E to BRL-CAD translater.

I've worked with the hf.  There are some problems with ray-tracing the
hf with the released version.

<p>
My height field is a 257x257 array of unsigned shorts (2 byte int).

<p>
That should all be typed in on one line, but I've broken the line for 
readability.  As far as I can tell this means:

<p>
	dfile="01.hf"		The data is in the file "01.hf"
	fmt="us"		The data is unsigned shorts
	w=257			257 samples wide
	n=257			257 samples long
	shorts=1		1 short per sample
	file2mm=31.25		heights are multiplied by 31.25 to get mm size
	v=0,0,0			origin of HF is at 0,0,0
	x=1,0,0			X axis aligned along 1,0,0
	y=0,1,0			Y axis aligned along 0,1,0
	xlen=256000		X axis is 256000mm
	ylen=256000		Y axis is 256000mm

&gt; I am having trouble trying to produce the documents available with the
&gt; burst package. Is it possible to have a README file, or something similar,
&gt; to give the instructions for the proper syntax for appropriate troff
&gt; commands? The same goes for the 'talk' subdirectory where it appears there
&gt; is an interesting paper, but no clue for novices about how to produce it.

<p>
Tom,
	It's been lots of years since typesetting of these documents has
been attempted by me (the author), and I can't test it out conveniently
because I'm no longer familiar with how/which TROFF fonts and macro packages
are configured on our various workstations and servers.  However, if you
have a troff capability, it used to work as follows:

<p>
	1) For burst/paper, typeset with a command like:

<p>
		"troff -mm -T[printer] paper.mm"

<p>
	where the [printer] selects the target printer type (ie -Ti300 for an
	300 DPI Imagen).  This assumes that the ".tbl" files have been
	preprocessed with there ".mm" source files (ie "tbl ids.tbl &gt; ids.mm").
	Note that "paper.mm" sources all other needed files.

<p>
	2) For burst/talk, you need to use the "mv" macros instead of "mm" on
	and run troff on each ".mv" source file:

<p>
		"troff -mv -T[printer] *.mv"

<p>
	If you have a "domv" script in that directory, it is intended to be
	used like so:

<p>
		"domv [file]"

<p>
	where [file] is missing the ".mv" suffix.  This script would need to
	be changed to select the proper printer, etc.  Currently it pipes the
	output through "dimp" which is a Device Independent Troff preprocessor
	for the Imagen printers, and then it pipes the result to "ipr" which
	is our Imagen spooler.

<p>
If you have problems, perhaps someone who still uses TROFF can be of more
help.  NOTE that the burst paper is published in at least one BRL-CAD
Symposium Proceedings and if you have the set of blue manuals that came out
with BRL-CAD Release 4.0 and beyond, it's in Volume III, The BRL-CAD
Applications, on a page marked "88" at the bottom, also "V3S07A00" in the
lower right corner (the page numbering is extremely not useful in this
document).

<p>
Hope this helps,
-Gary

&gt; 
&gt; SGIs Showcase software will allow open inventor files to be embedded into a

<p>
	There is a primitive "g-vrml" converter that will be in the next 
release of BRL-CAD. It is primitive in that it does not take advantage of 
all the capabilities of VRML. It does handle the geometry, and colors, 
but all light sources are reduced to point sources. Also relfection, 
transparency and textures are not handled yet (I don't recall how 
much of that VRML will actually do). You are correct in your expectation 
that this would require exporting a representation of the evaluated 
objects in a form similar to nmg. In fact, the converter produces NMG 
objects, then outputs them in VRML format. This means that "g-vrml" will 
only convert what our NMG codes can successfully handle, and while this 
is not 100%, recently we have seen about 95% success.

	I have added an "a_ray_length" field to librt's application 
structure. This is intended to work similar to "a_onehit", and has been 
implemented in much the same way. If this field is set to a non-zero 
value, then ray tracing is stopped as soon as we get beyond the 
"a_ray_length". The raytracing is done in increments of the space 
partitions, so this will not stop at exactly "a_ray_length", but it will 
stop before raytracing any space partition beyond "a_ray_length". I 
tested this out on the bradley and found that it works as I expected and 
does in fact reduce the time. Of course, if this is used on a very 
simple model, you will actually increase the raytrace time.

<p>
	Both "a_ray_length" and "a_onehit" can be specified and raytracing 
will stop as soon as either one is satisfied.

is mklinux running on a Mach microkernel.  Currently, it only runs on
PPC601 chips (PM 6100, 7100, 8100), and the official release is in
September.  It is possible to purchase a reference release on CD for $10
now or download the rather large files online.  Anyone interested should

&gt; I got the embarrassing problem of having .g files, but no adequate version of
&gt; g2asc for them, although I still have the right machine (a SGI iris3130) !
&gt; My .g files were made with mged version 3.7, and I do not have this version
&gt; handy.

<p>
It turns out that you are in luck -- I grew up in an IBM mainframe
envirnoment (long ago), and upwards compatability is something that I
work hard to maintain in BRL-CAD.

<p>
Binary ".g" databases from BRL-CAD Release 2.0, 2.3, 3.0, 3.7, 4.0, and
4.4 are all upwards compatible, meaning that databases created on
software with a smaller number can be read with more recent software.

<p>
(The reverse is sometimes, but NOT ALWAYS true -- if you write a
database on a higher numbered version of the software, it may or may not
be readable by a lower numbered version, depending on whether you happen
to invoke any of the newer features or not.)

<p>
Also, the ".g" format databases are directly binary compatible between
SGI 3030, SGI "4-D", Sun-3, Sun-4 (SPARC), and Alliant computers.

<p>
So you can just move your old ".g" file from the SGI 3030 onto a modern
SGI or Sun workstation running Release 4.4, and pick up where you left
off.

&gt; In mged (at least the way I have it here at ARL), there are some functions
&gt; available on the Function keys on a Silicon Graphics terminal.

<p>
&gt; I do not see any description of these in the on-line help provided in mged.

<p>
These are SGI-specific features.

<p>
On an SGI, you can get information about any of the buttons and knobs in
MGED by pressing and holding the HELP button on the button box (upper
left button), then pressing the button or twisting the knob you want
help on.

<p>
Here is a quick summary:

<p>
F1	Toggle depthcueing
F2	Toggle Z-clipping
F3	Toggle perspective on/off
F4	Toggle Z-buffering
F5	Toggle Lighting model (flat -vs- smooth shaded polygons)
F6	Select next perspective angle from list: 30, 45, 60, 90 degrees
F7	Toggle MGED faceplate off/on
F8	Toggle menu
F12	Zaps knobs/sliders back to zero

<p>
You can ascertain the status of the vendor-specific features currently
in effect by running the command "dm set" -- that will print the
vendor-specific settings of the current display manager.

Ken,

<p>
I have added the support for plate mode wedges as described below in patch-g.

<p>
&gt; 2.   'inside' solids were NOT generated and subtracted for 'plate' mode
&gt;       wedges.  Inside solids were generated/subtracted for all OTHER plate
&gt;       mode objects.
&gt;
This should cover your bug report for the patch-g convertor. We should make
arrangements to get the updated source or executable to you.

You've uncovered a bug. The output is going to stdout via another
process (i.e. cad_parea) instead of being captured and stuffed into
XMGED's command window. For now, you can look in the window
in which XMGED was started to see the return value.

Subject:  LIBRT booleans: more bu_ptbl's
Message-ID:  &lt;9608290250.aa08984@vm.arl.mil&gt;

<p>

<p>
This evening I converted the last of the old-style bit-vectors in
raytrace.h over to a bu_ptbl variable-length pointer array. This
affected the pt_solhits field in the partition structure; it's new name
is pt_solids_hit, and it is now a bu_ptbl.

<p>
This means that when rt_boolfinal() needs to evaluate the boolean trees
for the regions containing the solids found in each partition, rather
than having to scan a bit vector of length "nsolids" for non-zero bits,
it can just read the elements of a compact array.  For models with more
than about 80 solids this should be much faster.  I don't have any time
comparisons yet, because my development version is compiled -g (full
debug, no optimization) while the 4.4 version is compiled -O
(optimized), and that makes a big difference in runtime.

<p>
This change, combined with yesterday's work to eliminate the bit vectors
from the soltab and region structures, the overall memory (RAM)
consumption of LIBRT should be reduced, especially on larger models. To
test this theory, I compared memory use on the benchmark run of the M35
truck.  This database is very small, having 1126 solids in 893 regions.

<p>
Stage		(VAX Ref)	Release 4.4	Development	Savings
<hr>
initial		 907472		 262144		 262144		      0
GETTREE		1352576		1048576		1179648		-131072

<hr>
Total		2960760		2359296		2228224		 131072

<p>

<p>
The column marked "VAX Ref" is from the "pix" directory in Release 4.4,
but it looks like it may actually represent Release 4.0 memory use.
The pattern of "savings" between the development and 4.4 versions looks
like it might be an artifact of the system malloc() routine obtaining
memory from UNIX in bigish chunks, perhaps 128Kbytes at a gulp. I
find the 6% savings of 128Kbytes to be of value, although I had hoped
for something more dramatic.  For models 50 times larger the savings
should be substantial.

<p>
The 25% reduction in size over the old "VAX Ref" run shows that we
continue to travel in the proper direction!

Subject:  More LIBBU news
Message-ID:  &lt;9608280611.aa08337@vm.arl.mil&gt;

<p>

<p>
This evening I've moved two more sets of fundamental data-structure
support routines into LIBBU:  a nicely generalized version of the
variable-length bit-vector routines from LIBRT, and a slightly improved
version of that workhorse variable-length pointer-table-array routine:
nmg_tbl() from the NMG library.

<p>
Delving into how rt_shootray() and rt_boolfinal() use bit vectors,
I discovered that with the new bu_ptbl() at my disposal, I was able
to make the partition boolean code *much* more efficient, particularly
when large numbers of regions are involved.  Code that had been
O(nsolids)*O(nregions) became O(nsolids)*O(7) in runtime, and I think
I see a way to make that still faster, to roughly O(7)*O(7).

<p>
Having the bu_ptbl() routines handy, I was also able to plug a "memory
leak", regarding the "union cutter" structures not being properly freed
from frame to frame in an animation.  The problem had been that they
were "bulk allocated" and diced up, after which time it was impossible
to tell which items on the freelist corresponded to the head of the
blocks (and thus should be handed to bu_free()), and which ones were
"interior" to the blocks and should just be ignored.  With the new
routines handy, it was a simple matter to just collect a table of the
things to be freed using bu_ptbl_ins(), and then free up all the items
in the table at the proper moment.

<p>
Having power-tools like variable-length-strings and variable-length
pointer arrays makes life so much simpler!

<p>
	Onwards!

<p>

<p>
Paul of MIT asked -

<p>
&gt; is RT automatically dividing between both processors in the benchmark?

<p>
By default, RT will use all the processors installed in the machine.
It prints a message letting you know about this, right at the beginning.
Here is an example:

<p>
BRL-CAD Release 4.5   Ray-Tracer
    Sat Aug 31 07:40:28 EDT 1996, Compilation 1691
    mike@vapor.arl.mil:/m/cad/.rt.6d
Planning to run with 24 processors			&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;----------
db title:  Gary Moss's "World on a Platter"

<p>
So if your machine has 2 CPUs installed, the default benchmark would use
both CPUs.  You can specify the -P flag to RT to select a different
number of processors, a negative number indicates to use "all but" that
many processors.  For example, -P -4 on a 24-processor machine would
indicate using 20 processors.

This is probably so obvious to most it doesn't need to be said, but I 
may not be as swift as some others and maybe there are some others 
like me.  

<p>
While waiting for the new release that will work on IRIX 6.2, I 
simply copied the binaries and other files in  my /usr/brlcad 
directory (and sub directories) from my SGI Personal IRIS 4D35 
running IRIX 5.3 to a tar tape and moved them  to my new Indigo 2, Impact 
10000 running IRIX 6.2 and all that I've used so far (except patch-g) 
work quite nicely.  As a matter of fact, some utilities like fb-pix 
that complained of a "sgi_getmem" error on my PI don't pesent such 
errors on the new Indy.  (Perhaps the old PI is starting to wear 
out.)  Anyway, for those who need a SIMPLE SOLUTION and DO NOT NEED 
TO COMPILE new code, this seems to work.

MIME Types

<p>
MIME types are how the Internet applications know what type a file is
This is similar to associating an application with a file on a
Macintosh or associating a program with a file extension under Windows.
In order for browsers to recognize AutoCAD drawing and DXF files so
the appropriate action can take place (e.g. for the proper plug-in to
be run in Netscape), the server needs to have a MIME type associated
with the proper files. Contact your system administrator for more

After adding MIME types, your server may need to be restarted.

Look at "http://ftp.arl.mil/~jra/" and you will find that John Anderson has
done some work in this area.  Alas, VRML and BRL-CAD use radically different

elegant VRML representation of a BRL-CAD object.  I suspect John's converter

Look at the "light" shader.  It does essentially what you seek.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

<p>
Daniel,

<p>
Concerning, the raytracing problem.  The only way I know of getting rid
of the eyepoint bright spot is to put your own light into the model. 
This of course creates a bright spot relative to the position of your
light and its color.

<p>
I placed a sphere in a sample geometry, used the mater command to assign
the material "light" and a color of black (0 0 0).  I placed it below my
geometry objects in the display and raytraced the view with ambient
lighting set to 100%.  This gave a very nice flat image without any
bright spots from any light sources.

<p>
Without setting the color to black and setting ambient lighting to 0%
gave a very nice halo effect image.  A similar halo occurs with the
default level of ambient lighting.  Setting ambient lighting to 100%
once again gives a nice non-spotlighted image.  The black light source
with zero ambient lighting gives a completely black image of course.

<p>
I've recently had both the CyrixP166+ and the Intel Pentium166 in a Tyan
Tomcat motherboard.  I thought I'd pass on what I've learned to the list.

<p>
First of all, both parts performed flawlessly.  I had no unexpected reboots
or hangs.

<p>
The short of it is this:

<p>
Code			Cyrix	Intel
--------------------------------------
Boot Delay Multiplier	5644	4244
RT Benchmark		  26	  43

<p>
Price (US$)		 273	 427

<p>

<p>
In both benchmarks a bigger number indicates faster operation.

<p>
The "Boot Delay Multiplier" calculation is an entirely integer process.  Here
the speed advantage of the Cyrix chip is clear.  The speculative execution
and/or branch prediction hardware pays off big.  This is especially true
since the Cyrix chip is running at 133Mhz internally, instead of 166Mhz.

<p>
The "RT Benchmark" is a raytracing application and does a relatively large
amount of floating point operations in addition to some complex coding
structures.  While the Cyrix chip does well at optimizing the branching and
looping conditions, the floating point unit just isn't a match for the Intel
part.  Floating point performance on the 133Mhz Cyrix is roughly equal to 
a Pentium90.

<p>
Certainly if you are running an ISP and just serving web pages and running
E-mail boxes, I'd seriously consider the Cyrix part.  Better, faster,
cheaper for that type of application.  It's also a bit faster at typical GUI
painting for X-workstations (mostly integer bit shuffling).

<p>
There are two things that recommend the Intel part.  The first is if you do
more than a little floating point computation.  If you're doing anything
like scientific computing, I'd go with the Intel chip.

<p>
The second is if you want to run multiple CPU's on one motherboard.
While Cyrix cpu's can support multi-processor motherboards, they use a
different standard than the (proprietary) one that Intel uses.  I've heard
that dual CPU motherboards will soon be available for the Cyrix chips, but 
they don't seem to be out there today.

&gt; Thanks for the reply.  I have yet another question.  Is there a way presently,

<p>
	No, the IGES 114 is a parametric spline surface, and we haven't
done any support for that yet. You may be able to find some software to
convert the 114 entities to 128 entities (NURBS) which we can import
from IGES. Check at http://www.eeel.nist.gov/iges/igesTools.htm. They
have some free tools available there.

<p>
I've created a file in h/sed4 which you can use to feed to ED to mostly
automatically convert a C source file written for Release 4.4 to the new
bu.h and bn.h routines for Release 5.0.

<p>
I've run it on the NMG code in LIBRT, it required minimal hand-tweeking

<p>

<p>
Just to clarify:  It is NOT necessary to apply h/sed4 to C source in
order to get it to work with Release 5.0; the h/compat4.h header file
is auto-included by raytrace.h, and provides 100% source compatability.

<p>
It just seemed appropriate to me that the libraries be internally
converted, rather than relying on h/compat4.h.

	"Qrot" allows you to rotate an object about an arbitrary axis.
The regular "rotobj" rotates about the "X", "Y", or "Z" axes only.

Hi Rich -

<p>
&gt;      OK, I'll bite.  What are v4/v5 (version numbers)?  You've
&gt; got so many BRL-CAD irons in the fire that I'm not sure to which
&gt; new capability this message refers.

<p>
Oops, yes, that's likely to be confusing without context.  Here I'm
referring to the geometry database format. v1, v2, and v3 were the
original ".g" (aka ".vg") formats for GED (pre MGED, pre BRL-CAD), v4 has
been the production ".g" format for BRL-CAD since 1985, v5 is the fabled
"new database" format that we've been talking about for the past year or
so.

<p>
I realize these numbers are confusing, as there is also BRL-CAD Release
4.4 (production and 5.0 (development), FASTGEN 4 and FASTGEN 5, COMGEOM
4 and COMGEOM 5, SunOS 4 and SunOS 5, etc.etc.  Seems to be "the time"
for 4 and 5 as version numbers in mature products. *grin*

<p>
Anyway, the progress report was just to let you know that important pieces
of the v5 database are beginning to solidify into actual working C code,
rather than just being specifications on a Web page.

<p>
http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/papers/brlcad5.0/newdb.html  for the specs.  :-)

Subject: BRL-CAD 4.4 under Linux 1.2.8

<p>

<p>
	I finally got around to installing BRL-CAD 4.4 on my PC. I am
running Linux 1.2.8 on a Packard Bell with a Pentium 75 Mhz Processor
and 16Mb of memory. My compiler is gcc version 2.6.3. I needed to make a
few changes to get BRL-CAD compiled, here they are:

<p>
1. The makefile for cake ("cake/Makefile") calls lex to process
"cake_s.l". There are some ifdefs in "cake_s.l"  to account for the fact
that "flex" (the GNU version of lex) does not define "yylineno".
However, under this version of Linux, "lex" is defined as "flex -l". The
"-l" option to "flex" tells it to be compatible with the orignal AT&T
"lex". The result of all this is that the ifdefs are trying to correct
for differences that aren't there. The easy fix here is to replace "lex"
in the cake "Makefile" with "flex".

<p>
2. In libplot3, version 2.6.3 of gcc cannot compile plot3.c with the
default O2 optimization. This has been reported to MIT as a compiler
bug. The fix is to compile plot3.c with no optimization or use GCC 
version 2.7.2.

<p>

<p>
3. After compilation, "mged" worked fine, but "rt" complained: "db_scan
ERROR:  File is lacking a proper MGED database header". I'm not yet sure
of the basic problem behind this, but it has to do with opening a file
twice (once to get a file descriptor and once to get a FILE pointer).
In "librt/db_open.c" there is a block of code :

<p>
                if( !dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem && sb.st_size &lt;= INMEM_LIM )  {
                        dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem = rt_malloc( sb.st_size,
                                "in-memory database" );
                        if( read( dbip-&gt;dbi_fd, dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem,
                            sb.st_size ) != sb.st_size )
                                goto fail;
                        if(rt_g.debug&DEBUG_DB)
                                rt_log("db_open: in-memory file\n");
                }

<p>
This reads the entire database file into memory if it is small enough.
Later "db_scan" rewinds the database file and looks for the "proper MGED
database header" using "fread" (note that "db_open" used "read") .
It appears that under Linux 1.2.8 there is some missing communication
between the file descriptor and the FILE pointer. The "fread" call in
"db_scan" returns "0" and "foef" returns true. This means that even
though the file was just rewound, it is still at EOF. The fix for this
one is to just replace

<p>
                        if( read( dbip-&gt;dbi_fd, dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem,
                            sb.st_size ) != sb.st_size )
in "db_open.c" with

<p>
                        if( fread( dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem, sb.st_size,
			    1, dbip-&gt;dbi_fp ) != 1 )

<p>

<p>

<p>
With this last change, "rt" now works. I ran the benchmark and got the following:

<p>
Abs	4021.12	1963.12	1752.41	1630.53	1995.19	2272.47	Thu Dec 28 01:41:28 EST 1995
*vgr	29.34	29.27	31.25	30.55	28.22	29.72	

<p>

<p>
Not bad for 75 Mhz Pentium!!!
(I verified a couple of the timings by hand)

one is to just replace

<p>
                        if( read( dbip-&gt;dbi_fd, dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem,
                            sb.st_size ) != sb.st_size )
in "db_open.c" with

<p>
                        if( fread( dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem, sb.st_size,
                            1, dbip-&gt;dbi_fp ) != 1 )
-----------------------------

<p>

<p>
	Looking at the code just now, I notice that this block of code
seems to be missing a line setting the value of "dbip-&gt;dbi_eof". This
could be the cause of the error. I would try adding a "dbip-&gt;dbi_eof =sb.st_size;"
in the same block of code discussed above as shown:

<p>
                if( !dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem && sb.st_size &lt;= INMEM_LIM )  {
                        dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem = rt_malloc( sb.st_size,
                                "in-memory database" );
                        if( read( dbip-&gt;dbi_fd, dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem,
                            sb.st_size ) != sb.st_size )
                                goto fail;
			dbip-&gt;dbi_eof = sb.st_size;
                        if(rt_g.debug&DEBUG_DB)
                                rt_log("db_open: in-memory file\n");
                }

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I"ve encounterd some problems using xmged:
&gt; after building an object which is a group composed of two regions
&gt; I tried to make a mirror image of it using yjr "mirror" comand. The copy was created, I then 
&gt; tried placing it in the right place but when I placed "accept edit" the object I moved jumped to 
&gt; it's original location and I got a message sayin the objects could not be reploted.
&gt; I encountered this phenomenon using the "copy" comand as well.
&gt; any sugestions?

<p>
	I tried this myself and couldn't duplicate this behavior. When
the mirror command is applied to a group or region, it does not create a
new copy of the underlying objects. Only the new object mentioned on the
"mirror" command line is created. The new combination (group or region)
references the same underlying objects, but uses transformation matrices
to position them. If you edit the underlying objects, they will change
in both the original and the copy, but the relationship between the
original and the copy will stay the same. What you really want to do is
to use "object edit". The first step in doing an object edit (after
selecting "Object Illum" on the menu) is to pick the object you want to
edit. Move the mouse vertically to highlight different solids from the
objects on the screen until you find the one you want in the object you
want to edit. After you click the mouse to select the object, you will
be in "OBJ PATH" mode. In this mode, you move the mouse vertically to
select which transformation matrix to edit. Place the "[MATRIX]"
directly above the object you want to move. This will typically be the
new object that you created with the mirror command.

	Yes, a line needs to be added to vdeck.c near the end of the
routine gettree_leaf(). The "magic" number for the curtree structure is
not getting set. The existing code is:

<p>

<p>
        GETUNION( curtree, tree );
        curtree-&gt;tr_op = OP_SOLID;
        curtree-&gt;tr_a.tu_stp = stp;
        curtree-&gt;tr_a.tu_regionp = (struct region *)0;

<p>
        return(curtree);

<p>

<p>
It should be changed to:

<p>
        GETUNION( curtree, tree );
        curtree-&gt;magic = RT_TREE_MAGIC;
        curtree-&gt;tr_op = OP_SOLID;

Does anyone have a patch to compile BRL-CAD under a more recent

Someone should look into getting that old patch off of sunsite.
It is obsolete.  The latest patch for BRLCAD 4.4 comes courtesy of

Subject: BRL-CAD 4.4 under Linux 1.2.8

<p>

<p>
	I finally got around to installing BRL-CAD 4.4 on my PC. I am
running Linux 1.2.8 on a Packard Bell with a Pentium 75 Mhz Processor
and 16Mb of memory. My compiler is gcc version 2.6.3. I needed to make a
few changes to get BRL-CAD compiled, here they are:

<p>
1. The makefile for cake ("cake/Makefile") calls lex to process
"cake_s.l". There are some ifdefs in "cake_s.l"  to account for the fact
that "flex" (the GNU version of lex) does not define "yylineno".
However, under this version of Linux, "lex" is defined as "flex -l". The
"-l" option to "flex" tells it to be compatible with the orignal AT&T
"lex". The result of all this is that the ifdefs are trying to correct
for differences that aren't there. The easy fix here is to replace "lex"
in the cake "Makefile" with "flex".

<p>
2. In libplot3, version 2.6.3 of gcc cannot compile plot3.c with the
default O2 optimization. This has been reported to MIT as a compiler
bug. The fix is to compile plot3.c with no optimization or use GCC 
version 2.7.2.

<p>

<p>
3. After compilation, "mged" worked fine, but "rt" complained: "db_scan
ERROR:  File is lacking a proper MGED database header". I'm not yet sure
of the basic problem behind this, but it has to do with opening a file
twice (once to get a file descriptor and once to get a FILE pointer).
In "librt/db_open.c" there is a block of code :

<p>
                if( !dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem && sb.st_size &lt;= INMEM_LIM )  {
                        dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem = rt_malloc( sb.st_size,
                                "in-memory database" );
                        if( read( dbip-&gt;dbi_fd, dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem,
                            sb.st_size ) != sb.st_size )
                                goto fail;
                        if(rt_g.debug&DEBUG_DB)
                                rt_log("db_open: in-memory file\n");
                }

<p>
This reads the entire database file into memory if it is small enough.
Later "db_scan" rewinds the database file and looks for the "proper MGED
database header" using "fread" (note that "db_open" used "read") .
It appears that under Linux 1.2.8 there is some missing communication
between the file descriptor and the FILE pointer. The "fread" call in
"db_scan" returns "0" and "foef" returns true. This means that even
though the file was just rewound, it is still at EOF. The fix for this
one is to just replace

<p>
                        if( read( dbip-&gt;dbi_fd, dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem,
                            sb.st_size ) != sb.st_size )
in "db_open.c" with

<p>
                        if( fread( dbip-&gt;dbi_inmem, sb.st_size,
			    1, dbip-&gt;dbi_fp ) != 1 )

<p>

<p>

<p>
With this last change, "rt" now works. I ran the benchmark and got the following:

<p>
Abs	4021.12	1963.12	1752.41	1630.53	1995.19	2272.47	Thu Dec 28 01:41:28 EST 1995
*vgr	29.34	29.27	31.25	30.55	28.22	29.72	

<p>

<p>
Not bad for 75 Mhz Pentium!!!
(I verified a couple of the timings by hand)

Dear MUVES types,
     You may recall that some while ago (probably in the early stages of
AGS) we discussed various ideas about component kill algorithms that
might want to know which face of an object got hit--so one could treat
the front of a radio differently from its bottom, say.  We kicked around
several solutions, including building/converting the component to NMG
so you could have faces as explicitly modeled entities.  We also talked
about MUVES supporting yet another outboard file that would specify
an orientation for each component, so an EM could look at an entry or
exit normal and infer what face was involved.
     Well, in a discussion with Mike yesterday about improvements to our
texture-map shader, I learned that BRL-CAD already makes available pretty
much exactly what you need.  The (struct hit) has a member of type int
called hit_surfno, which encodes the surface of the solid in question.
BTW, for each partition you get a pair of (struct hit)s, one each for
entry and exit.  There is a convention for naming the surfaces of solids
of various types, for instance,

<p>
		ARB8				TGC
	---------------------		---------------------
	Surface #	Face		Surface #	Face
	---------------------		---------------------
	    0           1234
	    1           5678		    1		side
	    2           1485		    2	     top cap
	    3           2376		    3	  bottom cap
	    4           1265		---------------------
	    5           4378
	---------------------

<p>
In the case of the ARB, the modeler even has some control over which face
gets assigned which surface number:  some time ago I implemented a permute
command in MGED that allows one to rearrange the vertex labels of an ARB.
     The bad news is that not all the solid types currently report surface
numbers (e.g. the ARS).  And of course for others, like the SPH or TOR, there
is only one face.  But it shouldn't be too much work for us to police up all
the misbehaving solid types and teach them how to report something sensible.
     So if an EM wanted to be able to treat particular faces of components
differently, one approach would be to support an outboard file mapping lists
of ordered pairs of the form (solid_name, surfno) to component surfaces.
One caution... any such EM would then have an unprecedented sensitivity to
details of the .g file.  For example, if you create one ARB by mirroring
another, they really are mirror images, so their surface numbers will be
mirror image, too.
     To further support this approach, I've enhanced nirt by adding two
output items, surf_num_in and surf_num_out.  This way somebody preparing
target files for MUVES would not have to know the vagaries of the surface
encoding conventions, he can just get in mged, point nirt at the spot he's
interested in, and read off the required surface number(s).

<p>
David,

<p>
	We discussed two useful utilities that I thought might be handy
for your conversions and re-conversions of Pro/E models:

<p>

<p>
	1. Capability to assign idents, air codes, material codes and
	los numbers to BRL-CAD models from a file. The developmental
	version of MGED has an "rcodes" command that will read just
	such a file and assign the codes. The format is nearly the same
	as the output from the "idents" command, but with the first column
	of "region numbers" deleted. (I don't know why the formats are not
	exactly the same). You could do an "idents" command on a model
	already converted from Pro/E (after you have invested the time
	to assign the codes), then edit that file to eliminate the first
	column (see the Unix "cut" command). The result would be useful
	to assign idents to the next version of the Pro/E model that
	comes down the pike. Note that the names of regions would have
	to be the same between the two models.

<p>

<p>
	2. Capability to create a "trail" file that could be fed to MGED
	to re-do all the commands that were performed in an earlier session.
	There is a "journal" command in the developmental version of MGED
	that stores your keyboard commands in an ascii file. This script
	can later be fed to MGED to run the same commands again. Not all
	commands end up in the "journal" file. Solid and object editing
	and mouse/knob/button commands are not included. And I'm  sure
	that commands requiring user interaction (like "edcodes",
	"red", or "ted") will also not be in the "journal" file. However,
	commands, like "r" commands that you would use to correct overlaps,
	would be in the file and could then be run on another file.

<p>

	These capabilities exist only in the developmental version, but
will be in the next release. I suspect we can arrange something if you
think these capabilities are needed for the Crusader project.

Subject: New 'E' command in MGED

<p>

<p>
	I have re-written the 'E' command in MGED using the algorithm
I sent out last week. I modified the algorithm slightly in the process.
Originally, I intended to do it all with NMG's, but this was much too
slow. I ended up alowing an option to the 'E' command.

<p>
	With no options, it does it the fastest way, by using the NMG
edges to plot the solids and intersecting the face planes to get the
solid intersection lines, but shooting rays at the original solids. This
is about as fast as the old 'E' command (I believe), but since the NMG
edge/faces don't exactly match the real solid (in curved surfaces),
edges often don't quite match up. In most cases, this is not a problem. 

<p>
	When an option is supplied (actually ANY option, but the command
syntax says '-s'), a polysolid version of the solid is used for the
raytracing so that the edges and faces agree exactly with the NMG
version, so edges match. This is still very much faster than than
my original attempt using NMG's all the way, but considerably slower
than with no options.

<p>

<p>
	This nearly completes the conversion of MGED to a database
format independent code.  There are still a few references to db.h
MACROS, and the code to handle the color tables (based on ident numbers)
still uses 'union record'. But that's all, I believe.

&gt; Good morning John,
&gt; 
&gt; I spoke with Ron Dexter today (apparently my email didn't get to him
&gt; about the PSHELL record).  Based on the "real" -60B NASTRAN file, Ron
&gt; guesses that the PSHELL record could be considered as a plate mode
&gt; indicator.  It only exists (in the -60B) for skin elements and all
&gt; occurrences have a thickness assigned.  Hes not sure that a zero
&gt; thickness would actually be valid in a true NASTRAN file even though
&gt; CATIA outputs a meshed NASTRAN file with a zero thickness entry (the
&gt; sample files).

<p>
	Sounds reasonable to me. Perhaps CATIA is doing just a "surface"
mesh as opposed to a "solid" mesh.

<p>
&gt; He will be sending copies of the latest sample files hes been working
&gt; with and some excerpts from the -60B NASTRAN file.  I'll pass them along
&gt; when they come in. 

<p>
	Great, I'll be looking forward to seeing them.

<p>
&gt;                     The CATIA meshed outputs are still CTRIA3 elements
&gt; but I've asked for some other element types from the -60B file.  Based
&gt; on our initial conversion samples, Ron has several questions concerning
&gt; the NASTRAN conversion you're working:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.	What is ARL planning / doing concerning the file sizes (NMG and
&gt; polysolid) which are unacceptably large (not practical for working
&gt; with)?  He converted a control rod and had a BRL-CAD file (polysolids)
&gt; that was over 225Kb.  He's noticed that CATIA handles its large file
&gt; sizes fairly well (response times) but BRL-CAD tends to bog down (on the
&gt; same hardware) when its file sizes get to be large (&gt;15 Mb).

<p>
	Both the NMG and the polysolid are very sensitive to tesselation
tolerances. It is very easy to create an outrageously large NMG or
polysolid file from a simple curved surface primitive, just by selecting
a very small tolerance. The polysolid is more compact than the NMG
solid, just a list of polygons. If the files come from CATIA, then CATIA
is creating the polygons.

<p>
	We are investigating the possibility of using some compression
methods which could be applied to these situations, but that will
definitely not be in the next release.

<p>
	My experience has been that MGED will bog down when you try to
display too much geometry, but otherwise runs fairly nicely even with
very large databases.  The two important memory users in MGED are the
display list and the directory of objects. You can have a database
containing only a single object that creates millions of vectors in the
display list when displayed. You may also have a database that contains
millions of objects that create no vectors in the display list when
edited. The large display list can potentially slow down the graphics.
The large number of objects in the database can potentially slow down
everything. When I have seen this behavior it was due to excessive
swapping (not enough memory on the system).  We have been looking at
a new database format for BRL-CAD, perhaps a more compact form for
NMG's and/or polysolids could be considered.

<p>
&gt; 2.	How does ARL plan to handle the non-geometry data in the NASTRAN
&gt; file, given that NASTRAN (as used at Sikorsky) models load paths not
&gt; necessarily physical geometry?  Will the converter be caveated like the
&gt; IGES / AutoCad converters that only XX portions are processed?

<p>
	Currently, the plan is to ignore non-geometry. However, we might
use material ID nunbers from NASTRAN somehow in assigning materials in
BRL-CAD.

<p>
&gt; 3.	Who is ARLs sponsor for the NASTRAN conversion / what are they
&gt; expecting to get out of the NASTRAN file conversion (ties in with the
&gt; non-geometry data aspects)?  Ron is wondering if Sikorsky uses NASTRAN
&gt; differently from other companies - is Sikorsky the only company whose
&gt; NASTRAN files don't "match the physical geometry" of the vehicle (for
&gt; anything but portions of the structure / skin).  If this is an in-house
&gt; effort, Ron may be willing to support with limited file samples.

<p>
	This is an entirely in-house effort. Our FASTGEN competitors
have been touting their capability to convert NASTRAN to FASTGEN as a
reason why they don't want to use BRL-CAD, so we are attempting to quiet
that excuse. I am certainly not a NASTRAN expert, but from what I have
read, it is fairly common for the NASTRAN geometry not to match the
physical geometry. I would appreciate any sample NASTRAN files that
I could get my hands on.

&gt; Good Morning,
&gt;     one remark on the X-window interface. As you know is very slow, but it can
&gt; be made several times faster changing the line width from 1 to 0. Width 0
&gt; means the hardware default, which is 1 pixel, but much faster (for some

&gt; 
&gt; Good morning, 
&gt;    thank you for your quick answer. In fact I was not sure, so I continued
&gt; investigating in the problem. Now I do have the right answers, but I still do
&gt; not understand why. I have a box with a hole, and in the hole a cylinder which
&gt; fills it completely. I have constructed it with the following input:
&gt; 
&gt; killall *
&gt; press reset
&gt; title TARC Lead Block
&gt; units m
&gt; in block.s box -0.075 -0.075 -0.075 0.15 0 0 0 0.15 0 0 0 0.15
&gt; in hollow.s rcc 0 0 -0.080 0 0 0.160 0.032
&gt; in hole.s rcc 0 0 -0.075 0 0 0.150 0.032
&gt; regdef 1
&gt; r block.r + block.s - hollow.s
&gt; r hole.r + hole.s
&gt; g block.g block.r hole.r
&gt; size 0.5
&gt; B block.g
&gt; 
&gt; Then I wrote a very simple application which, given a ray (inside the model!)
&gt; returns the distance to the first (i.e. closest) hit. And I set onehit=1. What
&gt; happens then is that all rays starting in the quadrant x&gt;-0.032 y&gt;-0.032
&gt; intersect the cylinder correctly, while all the other do not see it and go
&gt; directly to the border of the box.
&gt; If I set onehit=2, I still have one only hit in the hit routine, and I can
&gt; tell because p-&gt;part_forw-&gt;part_forw == p, but this time it is the right one!
&gt; The fact is that I want only the first hit, so I thought that onehit should be
&gt; one. So now it works but I do not see why. Regards and thank you again for
&gt; your help. Carminati

<p>

<p>
	It looks like you are confusing ``partitions'' withs ``hits''.
Each ``partition'' structure has pointers to two ``hits''. A ``hit''
is an intersection between the ray and an object surface. A
``partition'' is a length of the ray that is entirely within an object.
The ``partition'' extends from an entrance ``hit'' (pt_inhit) to an exit
``hit'' (pt_outhit).

<p>
	The ``onehit'' flag sets the desired number of ``hits''.  If
``onehit'' is set to one, then only the first ``pt_inhit'' is valid.

<p>
	Another consideration is that if you fire a ray from within a
solid object, then the ray will also be traced backward to find the
``pt_inhit'' point, as well as forward to find the ``pt_outhit''. Note
that, in this case, the ``hit_dist'' for the ``pt_inhit'' will be less
than zero. However, if ``onehit'' is one, only the ``pt_inhit'' will be
valid.

<p>
	If you set ``onehit'' to two, you should only get one
``partition'' (which is two hits), and both hits will be valid.

<p>

<p>

&gt; Now that it looks like BRLCAD release 5 is coming over the horizon, 
&gt; is it possible to get a copy of the expected feature list for the new 
&gt; version ?

<p>
The most significant changes that you will notice are:
	
	completeley new mged (better than xmged) based upon Tcl/Tk
	no xmged
	OpenGL support for both framebuffer and mged.
	greatly improved booleans of NMG's
	new converters 
		VRML - can convert from BRL-CAD to VRML only
			This conforms to VRML 1.0.

<p>
		ACAD - can convert from BRL-CAD to ACAD only
			The ACAD format used is entirely triangular
			facets.

<p>
		Laser scan - can convert from laser scan data to BRL-CAD only
			This code is currently limited to Cyberware Digitizer
			Data in cylindrical scan format and is limited to 
			simple shapes only.

<p>
		Wavefront - can export polygons in Wavfront .obj format

<p>
	new shaders
		camo	cammoflage
		air/fog (homogenous mist)
		noise	(fBm/turbulence effects on color/surface_normal)
		cloud	Noise-based "solid cloud" shader
		fire	reminicient of brush-fire type flames

<p>
	librt extensively reorganized
	new utility and numerical handling libraries (broken out from librt)

<p>
&gt; We are particularly interested in the BRLCAD to polygon convertor 
&gt; which was expected to form part of the new release. How well does 
&gt; this work ?

<p>
It's still not foolproof.  But it does a better job now.

<p>
&gt; Are we likely to see online / downloadable manuals for the new 
&gt; version? Online manuals for the old version seemed to wither away 
&gt; after the first few elements were completed.

<p>
There is a fair bit of documentation that has been written for the new
release.  Especially on the new mged.  We are doing what we can to extend
and improve the documentation.  It will be available online, and as a part of
the distribution.  Summary:  The documentation will be better, but it still
won't be ... what I wish it was.

 I am currently using BRL-CAD Ver 4.0 and AutoCad Release 12.
 My intention is to use AutoCad to generate either an IGES-file or DXF-file,
 and ask BRL-CAD to read it as a G-file. I have problems in both cases.
 
 1. I exported a 3-D drawing into an IGES-file from AutoCad 12.The drawing
 does not contain any solids, everything is in terms of lines and mesh. Then
 i used
         iges-g -o file.g file.igs
 the program ran, but it gave me a flattened 2-D drawing in mged. it appears
 that the 3rd dimension is not being taken care of. i tried it with other
 flags, but to no avail. the help file for iges-g indicates that the program
 recognises only the IGES 5.1. i think AutoCad 12's IGES is not 5.1. 
 what do you think is the problem here? is it the IGES version which is the
 culprit? do you know of any CAD drawers whose IGES is compatible with BRL-CAD?
 
 2. I repeated the same procedure with a DXF-file from AutoCad 12. the help
 did indicate that the dxf-g works for Autodesk greater than 10 (i think). i
 tried
         dxf-g -i file.dxf -o file.g
 and an error indicates that an unexpected EOF is detected in input file. i
 removed the EOF line in the input file, still the same error. i tried
         dxf-g &lt;file.dxf&gt; file.g
 the program ran, but an empty G-file was created, in a sense, no drawing was
 shown in mged.
 what do you think is the problem here? is it a version thing again? if it
 is, do you know of any CAD drawers which will work with their dxf files?  

<p>
Thank You !

&gt;  tried
&gt;          dxf-g -i file.dxf -o file.g
&gt;  and an error indicates that an unexpected EOF is detected in input file. i
&gt;  removed the EOF line in the input file, still the same error. i tried
&gt;          dxf-g &lt;file.dxf&gt; file.g
&gt;  the program ran, but an empty G-file was created, in a sense, no drawing was
&gt;  shown in mged.
&gt;  what do you think is the problem here? is it a version thing again? if it
&gt;  is, do you know of any CAD drawers which will work with their dxf files?  

<p>
	Our DXF to BRL-CAD converter only considers 3DFACES and 3DMESH objects
in the DXF file. A drawing (2D or 3D) will not have either of these.

<p>
	BRL-CAD is solid modeling system with very little support for
"drawings". Generally, all objects in a BRL-CAD model are solids. You
might try creating a solid model in AutoCad and converting that to
BRL-CAD via either DXF or IGES.

&gt; something I not doing, Is there something I need to check.

<p>
Yes that is normal behavior.

<p>
What you have accomplished at this point is opening a geometry database
and attaching a graphic display window.

<p>
The program is now waiting for you to tell it what to do.  You have a
text window to type commands into and a graphic window for wireframe
displays and mouse commands.  The white dot (in the graphic display) is
the location of the 'center' of the 'camera - eyepoint' focus.  Its
X/Y/Z coordinate value in three dimensional space should be listed in
the lower left corner of the graphical display.

<p>
You can list the commands by typing "?" (no quote symbols) and pressing
return.  Typing "help" and pressing return includes the usage syntax for
the commands (scrolling your window).  Typing "help command" (replace
command with one of the commands from the list) will echo to the text
window the usage syntax for just that command.

<p>
Since you opened an existing geometry database, you should type "tops"
and press return.  This will list all of the database objects which are
on the top level (not members in a group or region).  For the cube.g
file the top level objects are:

<p>
all.g/              cloud.r.bak/R       light.r/R

<p>
where all.g is a group of regions and groups, cloud.r.bak is a region
containing solids, and light.r is a region (with a single solid) which
has been defined as a light source (internal to the geometry as opposed
to the default 'camera - eyepoint' light sources).

<p>
Typing "e all.g"&lt;return&gt; will display the object all.g on the graphic
display window as a wireframe representation of all the solids at the
root of the all.g heirarchical tree.  This is identified as 'viewing'
mode.  You can use the mouse in the graphic window or commands typed in
the text window to change the viewing angle, size, and location.  

<p>
Solid edit mode will permit you to change the individual coordinate
parameters which define a solid object - its individual length, width,
height, radius, location in space, and orientation.

<p>
Object edit mode will permit you to change a collection of region and
group objects with regard to their location, orientation, and overall
size in space.  The solids which are the defining root of the regions
and groups still retain the same (original) coordinate data defined in
their respective individual solid edit mode sessions.  Object edit
changes may be pushed to the root solids (changing the solids'
coordinate data) if there are no conflicts.  A conflict occurs when a
solid is used in multiple regions and the regions (or groups containing
those regions) have been object edited to different
locations/orientations/scales.

	The easiest way I know of (using the distributed MGED) is to use
the "idents" command to get the current data in a file, then edit that
file into a list of "edcomb" commands to accomplish whatever you want
with the edcodes info. Then use execute MGED using that file for
redirected input.

<p>
	By the way, "edcodes" does not set the color, just ident, air
code, GIFT material code, and LOS.

	In the file "gen.sh" at about line #297, you will find the

You might try changing "cake -k" to "cake -a". The "-k" option says

&gt; It sounds as if mged goes to the disk for
&gt; each mged data base command, even if nothing
&gt; is changed. The question is, is this behavior
&gt; correct?

<p>
This is correct.  The original design goals for MGED included that the
database file should always be in a stable state.  All actions on the database
are as atomic as we could make them.  Thus if the machine went down in the
middle of an edit, you would loose very little.

<p>
Modern practice for editors (text and otherwise) tends to emphasize speed
at the cost of reliability.  As a result the tendecy is to read the whole file
into memory, operate on it, and only write to disk under direct user
guidance.  This has limitations in terms of the size and complexity of the
database to be edited.

<p>
Both approaches have drawbacks.

<p>
Realize that the "tops" command has to process each item in the database.
Ergo, the larger the database, the longer tops will take.  As for "e", that
should only slow down when the number of objects you are displaying goes
up.  If you "e" up 1000 solids, it's going to take longer than if you "e"
up 10.

<p>

<p>
This evening, after a tremendous amount of infrastructure work in
librt/db_tree.c, I've finally been able to fix on the bug in MGED,
whereby adjusting the color of a region and giving the "redraw_vlist"
command gets the color updated on the screen.

<p>
Also, if I "B" or "e" the object after changing it, the screen shows the
new color.

<p>
Here is an example of how to reproduce it:

<p>
19 vj&gt; ./mged -n ../.db.6d/moss.g

<p>
The light sphere turns green.  Yay!

<p>
This also means that the "sun" turns yellow in the MGED window in

<p>
Jill,

<p>
	Mark Burdeshaw (now of ARA) asked me to stop by to discuss the
problem that some SURVICE people were having with BRL-CAD raytracing
(someone claimed BRL-CAD was ~400 times slower than FASTGEN, I believe).

<p>
	SURVICE is developing a sort of "seeker" model for AJEM (funded
by JTCG). They are using a FASTGEN model (converted to BRL-CAD) as the
target being seeked. The seeker model uses librt raytracing to simulate
whatever the real seeking technique is, so many rays are fired in the
direction of the target. It turns out that when the target was converted
from FASTGEN (using patch-g), it was converted into NMG solids. Remember
that we are talking release 4.4 here, NMG raytracing was still
experimental and extremely slow. It was easy to spot this problem (their
profile listing showed "rt_isect_faceuse" as a big time consumer). I
suggested that they re-convert the FASTGEN model using the "-p" option
to patch-g (this creates polysolids rather than NMG solids). Just using
polysolids instead of NMG solids should improve their raytracing
performance immensely.

<p>
	I should point out that the documentation for patch-g does not
mention the "-p" option (an oversight on my part). In the next
release(?), patch-g will produce polysolids by default, and the user
will be required to provide an option to get NMG solids.

Sure, the TeX version is a standard part of the distribution, as a SHAR

Carl,

	Sorry to take so long to respond, but as you surmise, LGT assumes
a square frame buffer.  This is a throwback from it's origin using square
standalone frame buffers rather than workstations with built-in graphics.
Except for very minor porting to new OS releases, LGT has undergone
virtually no change in 10 years or more and it shows.

Subject:  rfbd dropped, guts moved to LIBFB

<p>

<p>
This evening I decided to eliminate the RFBD program; nobody uses it any
more, it's been replaced by FBSERV.

<p>
I've also moved the guts (event handlers) of FBSERV to libfb/server.c.
I was going to try and get MGED to use the LIBFB routines, but
couldn't because of the way Bob had to #define the fbp variable
to make it part of the current dm context.  Oh well, was worth a try.

<p>

<p>
This evening I modified the calling sequence to libbu/bu_parallel()
so that threads are started with one additional parameter, a
caller-supplied genptr_t, which can be used to pass in a private
state structure.

<p>
This allowed me to eliminate some ugly use of global state variables
in db_tree.c and cut.c, and allowed me to make db_walk_tree() fully
recursive even in parallel mode, which is something that Lee and I
have been wanting for a long time, and I need to have now to hit one
of my TAPES bullets. :-)

<p>
If you encounter something I didn't convert, the extra arg may safely
be provided as NULL.

<p>
Hello * -

<p>
For the past couple of weeks I've been trying to find a combination of
AutoCAD and BRL-CAD tools to permit the exchange of images between the
two systems.

<p>
My test drawing (in the AutoCAD world) is of a cube with a small
rectangular cavity in one side.  My most recent success has been in
setting AutoCAD to output the drawing in "B-REP solid with analytical
surfaces" and using iges-g to translate to BRL-CAD g-format.

<p>
This works.. partway.  In an attempt to raytrace the object, 'rt' runs
for a while, emits a message "This better be a 2-manifold surface" and
dumps core (Platform: UltraSparc 2 with Solaris 2.5.1, running BRLCAD
4.5).

<p>
The same behaviour occurs when dealing with a "B-REP solid with NURB
surfaces."

<p>
Another curiousity is that modelling the cube-with-cavity in BRLCAD
shows the cavity with dotted-lines (indicating a subtraction?) but
modelling the AutoCAD-modelled cube-with-cavity has solid cavity
lines.

<p>

<p>
Suggestions?

<p>
Your time is appreciated.

<p>
Regards,

<p>
Mark

<p>
This implies that you are creating a B-REP NMG solid in BRL-CAD for your
object.  The NMG code in release 4.x is what I would call "experimental"
in quality.  However, for some database formats, it is the only way to 
achieve a conversion.

<p>
In your case, it seems that you are not creating a closed solid, but rather
a collection of planar surfaces which touch but are not topologically
connected.  You may wish to investigate the "asc-nmg" program.

<p>
In some cases, there are large performance improvements which can be achieved
by re-modeling the object (or parts of it) in BRL-CAD.  For example,
ray-tracing a BRL-CAD object consisting of an arb8 with a subtracted arb8 will
be much faster than ray-tracing the equivalent NMG planar suface
representation.  

<p>
For large models the effort to re-model may not be practical.  In these cases
I suggest investigating conversion of certain key sections for performance.

Carl,
     You wrote...

<p>
&gt; If I use -k argument and ALSO use -d "0. 3" argument, the color key
&gt; comes out the same LENGTH as above, with the white (zero) value in
&gt; the same place (far left) as before.  *But* the right end of the color
&gt; key becomes a blue shade (apparently the equivalent of 0.3333333 value),
&gt; and in-between parts of the color key are interpolated between this
&gt; value and the left endpoint's zero.

<p>
&gt; The intent of the normalization is to get data into the "0 to 1" range,
&gt; so I would expect the color key to show the 0 to 1 range.  Why is the
&gt; color key altered when I do said normalization?

<p>
     The color key is altered because of a bug.  Your hunch about the
program's behavior was correct, and I've fixed it in the developmental
sources.  By the way, in tracking your bug, I discovered another one, too,
which I've also fixed.

<p>
     And I've implemented a new option, '-M r1 g1 b1 r2 g2 b2', which
specifies that the color scale should be--instead of the standard
blue-to-red w/ 0=white--interpolated between r1/g1/b1 and r2/g2/b2.  With
the -M option it's now easier to be less wasteful of the colors at one's
disposal.  For instance, ramping the cell data, say, from white to red
leaves all the other colors (greens, blues, yellows, etc.) available to
encode additional information in the image (e.g., text, aimpoints, delivery
accuracy, etc.)

<p>
     Thanks for your bug report,
     Paul

	Mike asked me to notify when I changed the combination
import/export routines. I have done that. They now convert the shader
info to/from the TCL format. I also modified db_apply_state_from_comb()
to convert from TCL format back to the "keyword=value" format, so that
rt will still work. Note that when you supply shader info to the "mater"
command in MGED, it must now be in TCL format. The format is a list
where the first member is the shader name and the second member is a
list of (white space separated) shader keywords/values. For example,

<p>
	plastic sh=5
is now:
	plastic {sh 5},
and,
	stack camo c3="255 255 255";plastic
is now:
	stack { {camo {c3 {255 255 255}}} {plastic {}}}

<p>
each member of the stack shaders parameter list is a shader list itself.

	The "rt" code will try to send its output to a framebuffer, so
you may need to tell it which framebuffer to use. You can use the "-F"
option or set the "FB_FILE" environment variable. A pretty safe choice
for framebuffer on a SUN is "/dev/Xl". Try the "fbhelp" command to see
the available framebuffers.

<p>
Marcel,

<p>
  Sometimes our students have trouble getting RT to work and the cause of
this problem is usually easy to correct.

<p>
First:  Make sure that "/usr/brlcad/bin" is in your PATH.  The PATH is a
UNIX environment variable that tells what directories are to be searched
to find commands.  Even though you are in MGED, the RT command invokes an
outside code known as RT.  If your PATH is not set up correctly, then RT
is not found and therefore does not run.

<p>
        To determine whether this is your problem, try running RT outside
of MGED.  If the RT command is not found when it is run outside of MGED,
then it also will not be found if invoked inside of MGED.

<p>
SECOND:  As John pointed out, perhaps your frame buffer variables are not
set up correctly.  I do not suspect this in your case since the MGED
screen appears correctly.

<p>
        To determine whether this is the case, try invoking RT INSIDE MGED
with "rt -o junk.pix -s 512".  This will attempt, if everything else is
working correctly, a file named "junk.pix" in your current directory that
contains the image of whatever was on the MGED editor screen.  If the file
was created correctly and is somewhere around .75 MB in size, then your
problem is with the frame buffer.  Otherwise, perhaps the FIRST problem or
some other RT compilation problem may have occurred.

<p>
Hope this helps, Viva La France!

Correction, if you're running 8-bit X, you might want to do this under
'bash' which is probably your default Linux shell (otherwise use 'setenv'
instead of 'export'

<p>
export FB_FILE="/dev/XsPl"

<p>
You might or might not want to use the 's' option depending on how much
memory you've got.

Message-ID:  &lt;9808282313.aa09058@CAD.ARL.MIL&gt;

<p>

<p>
Of all the image file formats supported by Microsoft PowerPoint(tm),
Adobe PhotoShop (tm), Web browsers, and BRL-CAD(tm), the new PNG format
(Portable Network Graphics) is the best choice for the two-way exchange
of images.

<p>
PNG offers a typical compression ratio of 10:1, and uses a lossless
algorithm, so that there is no degradation of quality in the
decompressed image.

<p>
As you probably know, Jill has directed that all developmental BRL-CAD
and MUVES software is to be carefully protected. With Jill's express
permission, executable copies of these new PNG tools from the
developmental ("5.0") version of BRL-CAD have been added to the
"Production" BRL-CAD 4.4 executable tree stored in /usr/brlcad/ on the
IRIX 5.3 (wilson.arl.mil) and IRIX 6 (raven.arl.mil) RDIST master
machines. These binaries will be available to every machine that
subscribes to the ARL rdist service, including machines at ARDEC, TECOM,
CECOM, and elsewhere.

<p>
The programs png-fb, fb-png, and any-png.sh have been added, and the
programs pixinfo.sh and show.sh have been upgraded to support PNG.
Manual pages for png-fb and fb-png have also been installed. These files
should go out on the Friday night RDIST.

<p>
The any-png.sh script is a convenient tool which can convert one image
in any of our common formats (pix, bw, rle, yuv, jpeg, and gif) into
PNG. To convert an entire directory of images into PNG format, just run:

<p>
	for i in *
	do
		any-png.sh $i
	done

<p>
The PNG files are written in the current directory even if the input
file is taken from another directory.  So to get your own PNG version of
the radar teapot, you can just run:

<p>
	any-png.sh /n/wolf/demo/rt/radar-teapot.rle

<p>
You can then view the resulting image by running either:

<p>
	png-fb radar-teapot.png
or
	show.sh radar-teapot.png

<p>
(The show.sh program can display most image formats on your BRL-CAD
framebuffer.)

<p>
This is a great way to zap your V/L analysis results painlessly into
PowerPoint or PhotoShop!

<p>
Credit:  As an interesting historical note, the PNG format was developed
by a large group of people, including Glenn Randers-Pehrson, a long-time
Army employee (ARDEC, BRL-TBD, ARL-WMRD), now retired.  John Anderson
ported the PNG library into the BRL-CAD source tree, and he and I wrote
these new converter tools.

<p>
	Enjoy!

Subject:  brlcad-check.sh split out from setup.sh
Message-ID:  &lt;199812302229.aa22878@CAD.ARL.MIL&gt;

<p>

<p>
As an additional tool for us developers, I've broken out the parts
of setup.sh that checked the settings of $PATH, cake, machinetype.sh
and Cakefile.defs into a separate shell script named "brlcad-check.sh".

<p>
setup.sh runs brlcad-check.sh, but if you're unsure about whether
your path is set right, you can run it directly.

<p>
Best of all, if you're struggling to get machinetype.sh and cake and
Cakefile.defs to all agree, you don't have to re-run setup.sh (and
be forced to recompile CAKE) each time you experiment.

<p>
	Best,

Subject:  Release 5.0 on FreeBSD
Message-ID:  &lt;199812310124.aa09935@CAD.ARL.MIL&gt;

<p>

<p>
As a starting point today, I modified gen.sh and Cakefile.defs
to support using the vendor-provided versions of the TCL and Tk
libraries, when compatible versions are provided.  In the case of
both FreeBSD and Linux, libtcl8.0 and libtk8.0 are available.
In those cases, one less thing we need to ship along.

<p>
This evening I succeeded in taking the final step in the FreeBSD port:
getting the package to build using shared libraries and optimization.
Now that I've figured out all the magical compiler options needed,
it works just fine!  The full install tree for FreeBSD is 13.7 Mbytes,
just slightly larger than a full install for Linux (12.7 Mbytes).

<p>
This is an extremely small disk requirement for modern software; the
full BRL-CAD package can fit nicely on any laptop computer running
FreeBSD or Linux.

<p>
	Best,

	I have modified db_tcl_comb_adjust() in tcl.c such that a "db
adjust any_comb_parameter none" will set that parameter to its "not used",
or its default value.

X-URL:    http://ftp.arl.mil/~butler/index.html
Message-ID:  &lt;199901251338.aa00538@CAD.ARL.MIL&gt;

<p>

<p>
A new shader called "extern" was born in about 40 lines of code today.  It's
just a version of the venerable "stack" shader that takes it's parameters
from an external file.  The only parameter is the name of the file containing
the real parameters.  Usage:

<p>
	mged&gt; mater foo.r "extern {shader.txt}" 255 255 255 1

<p>
Then you need to fill in the file "shader.txt" with the actual parameters
you wanted on the command line.

<p>
	mged&gt; exec cat shader.txt
	camo s=200 t1=-.3 t2=.125;plastic di=.8

<p>
This lame little hack allows us to sneak around the buffer length limits in
the v4 database format.

&gt; The stock mged has a useful tree depth of twelve levels.  Is there a simple

&gt; Thanks.

<p>
	Yes, in "h/solid.h", there is a line that defines MAX_PATH. You
can adjust this, then recompile mged. Making this larger will increase
the memory used for each solid in MGED's display.
