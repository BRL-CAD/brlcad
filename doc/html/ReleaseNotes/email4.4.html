<p>
This is a minor change to make mged/dm-xgl.c compile on a Sun
workstation with XGL. XGL is an add-on product for the Sun, desirable
primarily if you have a Sun GX hardware graphics processor.  Unless you
have added dm-xgl to your MGED configuration, you do not need this fix.

<p>
Thanks to the folks at U.S. Army MICOM for contributing the dm-xgl.c
module. This error is entirely my fault, it crept in when I converted
their code to use the new "chunky" vlist structures.  Since BRL does not
have a copy of XGL, the modifications could not be tested. Thanks to
David Turner of Sandia National Labs for pointing out the error, and
debugging with me via "remote control" on the telephone one long
afternoon.

Inside MGED, I have eliminated the subroutine pr_solid(), and replaced it
with a new one that uses import/export ft_describe() interface instead.
This is an important step in the cleanup of solid editing.

<p>
&gt;I am not much of a hacker, but I need to compile BRLCAD on
&gt;my Sparc 1+ running the MIT's X11R4, not OpenWindows.

<p>
In Cakefile.defs, change these two lines:
#       define  sun_no_opts     /* Production configuration */
#       undef   sun_x11

<p>
to these two lines:
#       undef  sun_no_opts     /* Production configuration */
#       define   sun_x11

<p>
If your X11 software is not in /usr/X11 (/usr/X11/include, /usr/X11/lib) then
you will need to modify the following section to reflect where the include
files and libraries are located:

<p>
#       ifdef sun_x11
/*              Sun with X11 configuration */
#               define  LIBFB_OBJS      if_remote if_ab if_sun if_X
#               define  LIBFB_CONFIG    -DIF_REMOTE -DIF_AB -DIF_SUN \
                        -I/usr/X11/include -DIF_X
#               define  LIBFB_LIBES     LIBPKG -lsuntool -lsunwindow -lpixrect \
                        -L/usr/X11/lib -lX11
#               define  MGED_OBJS       dm-sun dm-X

Considering the number of user sites that we have, and that we don't
have any staff allocated for external user support, it can be a bit
annoying  when people don't experiment a bit with configuration before
calling for help.  We have tried to make configuration choices as
clear and simple as possible.

<p>
Anyway, for some reason it was not clear to me that you wanted an X-only
configuration.  Simply change the lines to remove the if_sun, -DIF_SUN,
dm-sun, -DDM_SUNPW entries, and remove the suntools library references.

<p>
I have expanded our copy of Cakefile.defs to make an X11-only version

Dear Keith:

<p>
John Ecker &lt;eckerjal@aplcomm.jhuapl.edu&gt;, from the Johns Hopkins Applied
Physics Laboratory, wanted to know how well supported the Apollo DN10000
is supported by BRL-CAD.  He knows there is a configuration set up
in the "cakefiles" but would like some more information.  Keith (Bowman)
is not familiar with the hardware, so he suggested to me that I forward
this on to you.  John's telephone number is (410) 792-6000 ext. 7902.

<p>
The Apollo DN1000 is not on the "supported" list, but it works OK
last I checked (which was 2 years ago).  I expect that it will take
minor polishing, but can probably be made to work.  If the machine
is on the net, and problems are encountered, I might be able to help
for an hour sometime.  But if Apollo has changed things drasticly,
no telling.

<p>
Also worthy of note is that there is no "local" support for image output
on the DN1000;  only the X-windows interface is available.  And that isn't
the best way to use our software, but it does work.

Hi John -

<p>
When your a_hit() routine gets called, you have a doubly linked list
of partition structures.  Each partition represents a chunk of solid.
From the partition structure, the element pt_regionp gives you a pointer
to the region structure, which will give you your material properties
info, and the partition name (pt_regionp-&gt;reg_namep).  The elements
pt_inseg and pt_outseg will give you pointers to the segment of the
solid that the in and out points actually struck;  from there, the
primitive solid's name (as opposed to the region name) is found from
pt_inseg-&gt;seg_stp-&gt;st_dp-&gt;d_namep, the entry solid type is in
pt_inseg-&gt;seg_stp-&gt;st_id, and the particular surface number
(specific to each st_id value) is in pt_inseg-&gt;seg_in-&gt;hit_surfno.

<p>
Does this give you enough to go on?  If not, perhaps you can give me
some kind of idea what info you need.
	Best,
	 -Mike

Subject: RPP on objects

<p>
I have noticed that in rtip-&gt;mdl_min and rtip-&gt;mdl_min is stored the bouding
rectangular parallel piped for a model.  But it seems that the values stored
in the above points are not reflective of any combinatorial regions.

<p>
For example when a cube of 10x10x10 is cut in half by 5x10x10 object, 
rtip-&gt;mdl_min and rtip-&gt;mdl_max still give me 10x10x10.

<p>
Am I using them incorrectly or does anyone know of a (painless) simply
way of getting at the bouding RPP for model made up of many combinations.

<p>
Thanks fo any help.

<p>
The values mdl_min and mdl_max are the corners of the bounding RPP for
the model.  The bound is computed at "prep" time, and is made as
tight as it can be, without extensive effort.

<p>
In essence, the model RPP is the convex hull of all the solids
in the model which are mentioned at least once in either a
non subtracted or non intersected sense.

<p>
Thus, if you had a small object with a huge object subtracted out, the
model RPP would be that of the small object.

<p>
In your example, of a larger object having a smaller object subtracted
out, the model RPP remains that of the larger (non-subtracted) object.
(The same thing holds true if you are using intersection to discard
unwanted material).

Message-ID:  &lt;9202251059.aa06215@VMB.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
Mike,

<p>
	Suppose I have n solids, { S1, S2, .., Sn } with bounding
RPP's for each Si, RPP(Si),  characterized by the two vectors, 

<p>
	[ minXSi, minYSi, minZSi ]   &   [ maxXSi, maxYSi, maxZSi ],

<p>
and I combine the Si's with boolean operations OPi, i.e.

<p>
	region =  OP1 S1 OP2 S2 .. OPn Sn  ( where OPi is "+","u", or "-").

<p>
I want to define an RPP, RPP(k), characterized by

<p>
	[ minXRk, minYRk, minZRk ]   &   [ maxXRk, maxYRk, maxZRk ],

<p>
for the object resulting from the first k combinations in the region
list in terms of RPP(k-1), the bounding box of Sk, and the operation
OPk.

<p>
Starting with the first solid and operation ( I assume it is not "-"),
define

<p>
	RPP(1) = RPP(S1) 
i.e.
	[ minXR1, minYR1, minZR1 ] = [ minXS1, minYS1, minZS1 ] 
and
	[ maxXR1, maxYR1, maxZR1 ] = [ maxXS1, maxYS1, maxZS1 ]

<p>
For RPP(k), k&gt;1 the definition depends on the specific operation OPk:

<p>
	if OPk = "u" then

<p>
		minXRk =  min ( minXRk-1, minXSk )
		minYRk =  min ( minYRk-1, minYSk )
		minZRk =  min ( minZRk-1, minZSk )

<p>
		maxXRk =  max ( maxXRk-1, maxXSk )
		maxYRk =  max ( maxYRk-1, maxYSk )
		maxZRk =  max ( maxZRk-1, maxZSk )

<p>
	if OPk = "+" then

<p>
		minXRk =  max ( minXRk-1, minXSk )
		minYRk =  max ( minYRk-1, minYSk )
		minZRk =  max ( minZRk-1, minZSk )

<p>
		maxXRk =  min ( maxXRk-1, maxXSk )
		maxYRk =  min ( maxYRk-1, maxYSk )
		maxZRk =  min ( maxZRk-1, maxZSk )

<p>
	if OPk = "-" then

<p>
		minXRk =  minXRk-1
		minYRk =  minYRk-1
		minZRk =  minZRk-1

<p>
		maxXRk =  maxXRk-1
		maxYRk =  maxYRk-1
		maxZRk =  maxZRk-1

<p>

<p>

<p>
Thus, for a union operation, the bounding RPP becomes the smallest
(axis-aligned) RPP that contains the previously defined RPP and the
RPP of the current solid.  This is not the convex hull of these RPP's,
but it is the smallest RPP that contains the convex hull of these
RPP's. ( A convex hull of two sets is the smallest convex set that
contains the two given sets.)

<p>
For the intersection operation it is possible for the RPP's to
get smaller.  In fact, if any of the min components are bigger than
the max components for RPP(k), you have a null region.

<p>
For the subtraction operation, you have just ignored the the RPP of the
subtracted solid.

<p>
	Is this the way the RPP's for REGIONS are defined in terms
of the RPPs of the SOLIDS and the corresponding operations in BRLCAD?
Your last parenthetical comment leads me to believe that your intersection
algorithm does not reduce the region RPP when it sometimes could.

<p>
&gt; 	Bill Mermagen discussed the current status of the intermediate
&gt; rayhistory file generator for SRIM that uses RT for raytracing
&gt; functions.  The generator uses a FORTRAN call to write the properly
&gt; formatted FITS header and ray information to a file that can be read by
&gt; SRIM 4.0.  This then makes it possible for a user to use RT and still
&gt; run SRIM 4.0, a relatively painless transition from the current
&gt; approach.  Users of SRIM have been given the option of tagging specific
&gt; solid faces with certain material properties; this can lead to ambiguous
&gt; material definition.  Mermagen's approach has only allowed the user
&gt; access to the region identifiers--if a certain surface needs a
&gt; particular material type, the geometry must be explicitly modeled.
&gt; Mike Muuss indicated at some point that surface identifiers could be
&gt; provided with some small work, but that hasn't happened. ...

<p>
In BRL-CAD Release 4.0, I call your attention to

<p>
struct hit {
	:
	:
	int		hit_surfno;	/* solid-specific surface indicator */
};

<p>
which is provided at every point a ray enters and exits a region.

<p>
If you have some way of making sense of the different surfaces of
the different solids that go into making up a region, you are welcome to
use the information.  It has always been present for purposes internal
to the library;  in Release 4.0 I gave the variable a more descriptive
name, knowing that the ERIM folks had need of it.  There isn't any
documentation on how to use it, other than the source code of the
geometry modules, but the legal values are all clearly #defined.
A header file could be created if they are going to start getting used
by applications.

<p>
I would be interested in learning more about what use these numbers would
be put to.

&gt; 	Along the same lines, Mike, are the bounding boxes for each

&gt; to need this info and it would be convenient to have a little code to
&gt; spew them out.

<p>
The answer is yes, if you don't mind calling a subroutine.

<p>
If you have a ray partition (struct partition), pp-&gt;pt_regionp gives you
a pointer to the (struct region) that you hit.  So, declare a region pointer,
and the min and max points of your RPP:

<p>
	struct region	*regp = pp-&gt;pt_regionp;
	point_t		rpp_min, rpp_max;

<p>
	rt_bound_tree( regp-&gt;reg_treetop, rpp_min, rpp_max );

<p>
Now you have the RPP of that region in rpp_min and rpp_max.  Note that if

<p>
	if( region_max[X] &gt;= INFINITY )

<p>
then this region is infinite, e.g., it has a non-subtracted halfspace in
it, and the RPP has no meaning -- it's infinite too.  (For computation
purposes, a specific number has been chosen to represent infinity, so
that it can be tested against.  The exact value is machine specific, but
is always at least 1.0e+20 mm, which satisfies all but the astronomers
in the crowd.

<p>
A similar procedure can be used to find the bounding RPP of an
individual solid, but I'd be surprised if you really wanted that.

<p>
Hope this helps!

<p>
Thanks for the nice note, Ed.  In fact, I mis-"spoke" when I said
"convex hull";  the bound is tighter than that, and the algorithm used
is precisely the one you spelled out.  You described it to me some years
ago, and the new tree walker implements it.

<p>
But this observation does not help the fellow I was responding to,
because, as you noted:

<p>
&gt; For the subtraction operation, you have just ignored the the RPP of the
&gt; subtracted solid.

<p>
whereas he was expecting the RPP to shrink after a subtraction.  While I
would enjoy having a tighter bound in that case, I don't know any cheap
way it could be calculated.  About the best I could suggest would be to
tessellate, evaluate the boolean using the NMG code, and find the
bounding RPP of that.  Not exactly cheap. And I wouldn't suggest
depending on the BRL-CAD 4.0 release to do any hard booleans.

<p>
I'm sure that folks will be happy to know that after a nearly year-long
haiatus, NMGs are again getting active attention.  Forward progress (as
opposed to congress) is being made.

One other thing: you didn't address the question of whether the current

first note implied in the last sentence that the intersection would
simply ignore the second RPP upon intersection.  The method I described
reduces the RPP in such a case:

if in the case above we had S1+S2, then the bounding RPP would
be the little box:

Message-ID:  &lt;9202281041.aa00757@VMB.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
Lgt users,

<p>
	I have improved the hidden-line algorithm so that highly oblique
surfaces no long get erroneously filled in.  Thanks to Tyler Brown and
Keith Applin for showing me a particularly pathological example of this
problem; I was aware of it as a design flaw, but didn't have a solution
for it.  The severity of the example inspired me to revisit the problem.
The fix involves testing for high obliquity against a built-in tolerance
so if anyone still sees black areas I may need to tweak the tolerance a
bit or make it user selectable.  Note that low resolution will typically
result in filled in areas (thick lines) where adjacent edges merge, but a
1024x1024 resolution can typically resolve the edges better, this is not
a fault in the algorithm.  Use of the anti-alias lgt option can further
improve the apparent resolution with hidden-line drawings, it's not just
for color shaded images.  I am not aware of any remaining shortcomings in
the hidden-line algorithm, let me know if you see any missing or spurious
edges in your lgt images in the future.

<p>
	There was also a minor bug where lgt would claim that a certain
number of processors were in use when the user had in fact configured
in a different number.  This was due to printing the message after all
UNIX shell command-line options were processed, but before all user
commands were read from the standard input.  This was easily fixed,
thanks to Sue Coates for reporting this bug.

<p>
	I have installed the fixed lgt yesterday on walrus in the BRL-CAD
distribution, so all of the SGIs that get the rdist should receive it by
today or tomorrow.  The older version is still available as lgt.bak.

<p>
This evening, I made some modifications to librt, so that
per-cpu statistics are now kept secretly in struct resource,
and then merged into the rt_i struct after parallel processing ends.

<p>
This has resulted in the SGI results for 8 processors going from
4X one processor, up to 6X.

<p>
A pretty good fix, but I think some more performance can still be found.

<p>
My tentative conclusion is that multi-processor interlocks may have
gotten somewhat more expensive in IRIX 4.0, but I don't have any
firm indictment.

Just now, I have placed the file "brl-cad/errata4.0-irix4" on
ftp.brl.mil for anonymous FTP, containing a script which will upgrade
your BRL-CAD Release 4.0 distribution for use on an SGI running IRIX
4.0.1.

Here is the head of that file:

          ++++++++++++++++++++          ++++++++++++++++++++

<p>
As promised, this file contains a comprehensive set changes to the
BRL-CAD Release 4.0 which are necessary to compile the software on
Silicon Graphics (SGI) workstation with the latest operating system
releases, IRIX 4.0.0, and IRIX 4.0.1. In general, these changes should
also be applied on other kinds of systems as well.

<p>
This file *includes* all the modifications from these four existing errata
sheets:

-r--r--r--   1 mike     graphics    1054 Nov  2 03:13 errata4.0-sun-xgl

<p>
This means that you only have to run this one script before starting to
compile everything.

<p>
Note that on IRIX 4.0.1, programs which link with LIBRT will produce the
following two warning messages, which are due to a harmless (but
annoying) SGI library bug.  They can be safely ignored:

<p>
/usr/bin/ld:
Warning: _oserror: multiply defined
        previous (used) definition from '/usr/lib/libmpc.a';
        new (ignored) definition from '/usr/lib/libc_s.a'

        previous (used) definition from '/usr/lib/libmpc.a';
        new (ignored) definition from '/usr/lib/libc_s.a'

<p>
Cut off this top part of the file, and run the rest as a shell script.
Note that it must be run from the top directory of your CAD source tree.
"cd cad" before running it.

Subject: errata4.0-irix4 install report

<p>
Received and installed errata4.0-irix4 today on an SGI-4D/35.  (Used to be a 
4D20 but was upgraded) running IRIX 4.0.1.  Everything went pretty smooth and "-
most" stuff seems to be ok.  However, a few difficulties were encountered:

<p>
1)  'edpix' utility was not compiled or installed.  I think this is because of 
the code in gen.sh that skips the edpix code if the machine is NOT defined as a 
4D.  Strangely enough, this machine now responds to machinetype.sh as a 5D which 
apparently causes the edpix code to be skipped.

<p>
2)  rpatch and patch-g executables not compiled or installed.  This seems to be 
because the 'patch' directory is listed in the CDIRS list in gen.sh which, 
according to the comments, is for codes without cakefiles which really isn't the 
case for the rpatch and patch-g programs.

<p>
3)  This machine has a 360MB internal hard drive holding the / and /usr file 
systems and an external 1.2GB drive holding the /usr2 file system.  With the 
advent of IRIX4.0.1, there was not enough room on the /usr file system for the 
brlcad executables.  Therefore, I elected the option indicated in the 
install.tr file and redefined by BINDIR, LIBDIR, and ETCDIR definitions in the 
appropriate files.  This seemed to work fine EXCEPT for the man pages.  The 
'brlman' command was found - would respond with a usage prompt if no args were 
given - but would respond with nothing if any arg was provided.  Turned out, 
definitions in the brlman and awf scripts in the ./bin directory ALSO had to be 
changed to reflect my non-standard installation.

<p>
4)  I have executed most of the utilities I normally used and all seem OK EXCEPT  
rle-fb.  This sits there apparently awaiting additional input.  It seems that a 
file pointer (*infp at line 33 in rle-fb.c) had to be changed so it would 
compile but the change to 'stdin' seems to cause some problems here.  I would 
appreciate some assistance in this area.

<p>
Hope this report is useful.

<p>
Bud -

<p>
Thanks for the detailed report, it was most helpful!

<p>
At BRL we are running both IRIX 3 and IRIX 4 systems.  They are
sufficiently different, that we needed "machinetype.sh" to distinguish
between them. Since IRIX 3 systems are called "4d", IRIX 4 systems got
named "5d".

<p>
1)  re: edpix.  You are correct, gen.sh has a special case for EDPIX
that only works on "4d", but not "5d".  Fixed, below.

<p>
2)  re:  patch directory.  Correct again.  Now that the patch tools
have a Cakefile, they need to move from the CDIRS to BDIRS list.  Fixed,
below

<p>
3)  re:  /usr overflow.  In a case such as yours, I would recommend
using a symbolic link, rather than changing the definitions, although
it *is* useful to know what got overlooked....  More specifically,
what I'd do is something like this:

<p>
	mkdir /usr2/brlcad
	ln -s /usr2/brlcad /usr/brlcad
	cd /usr/brlcad
	mkdir bin lib etc man .....

<p>
The symbolic link will not present a performance problem.  However, I'll
look into what got overlooked.  (I note that newbindir.sh has the
brlman/awf and brlman/brlman entries, even though install.tr does not.
I have updated the development copy to reflect this change).

<p>
If you hadn't updated the setting of $MANPATH in your environment,
that might have been the problem with the "brlman" command, especially
if you also had not changed the MANPATH=/usr/brlcad/man line in
brlman/brlman.

<p>
4)  re:  rle-fb.  I blew it, the fix was wrong.  Fixed, below.

<p>
&gt; Hope this report is useful.

The report was very useful.  In response to it, I have created a new
version of the errata sheet which addresses items 1, 2, and 4, above.
I have installed this updated version into FTP.BRL.MIL's brl-cad
directory in place of yesterday's version.  When this new version is
applied, the CAD software will identify itself as BRL-CAD Release 4.1,
to distinguish it from the unpatched software.

<p>
Here is the heading of the new, second edition, patch file:

<p>
          ++++++++++++++++++++          ++++++++++++++++++++

<p>
This document is at $Revision$.

<p>
As promised, this file contains a comprehensive set changes to the
BRL-CAD Release 4.0 which are necessary to compile the software on
Silicon Graphics (SGI) workstation with the latest operating system
releases, IRIX 4.0.0, and IRIX 4.0.1. In general, these changes should
also be applied on other kinds of systems as well.

<p>
Applying this patch file will bring your software up to BRL-CAD Release 4.1.

<p>
This file *includes* all the modifications from these four existing errata
sheets:

<p>
-r--r--r--   1 mike     graphics    4245 Mar 16 20:58 errata4.0-cake
-r--r--r--   1 butler   graphics     444 Nov 15 12:23 errata4.0-fbserv
-r--r--r--   1 butler   graphics     349 Nov 15 12:23 errata4.0-pixscale
-r--r--r--   1 mike     graphics    1054 Nov  2 03:13 errata4.0-sun-xgl
and
-r--r--r--   1 mike     graphics   30388 Nov  9 04:58 cad4.0.tar-patch.Z

<p>
This means that you only have to run this one script before starting to
compile everything.

<p>
Note that on IRIX 4.0.1, programs which link with LIBRT will produce the
following two warning messages, which are due to a harmless (but
annoying) SGI library bug.  They can be safely ignored:

<p>
/usr/bin/ld:
Warning: _oserror: multiply defined
        previous (used) definition from '/usr/lib/libmpc.a';
        new (ignored) definition from '/usr/lib/libc_s.a'
Warning: _setoserror: multiply defined
        previous (used) definition from '/usr/lib/libmpc.a';
        new (ignored) definition from '/usr/lib/libc_s.a'

<p>
Cut off this top part of the file, and run the rest as a shell script.
Note that it must be run from the top directory of your CAD source tree.
"cd cad" before running it.

&gt; From: Paul Tanenbaum &lt;pjt@server.cs.jhu.edu&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;      Sorry for the unsophisticated approach to the selection of addressees:
&gt; I just thought up a bunch of people, some set of whom would probably know the
&gt; answer to this question  (I've RTFM already, and not found the answer)...
&gt; Is the following hunk of code kosher:
&gt; 
&gt; 	foo ()
&gt; 	{
&gt; 	    widget	*wp;	/* data type defined elsewhere */
&gt; 
&gt; 	    if ((wp = (widget *) malloc(10 * sizeof(widget))) == NULL)
&gt; 	    {
&gt; 		fputs("foo():  Can't fit 10 widgets\n", stderr);
&gt; 		exit (1);
&gt; 	    }
&gt; 
&gt; 	    do_something(wp);
&gt; 
&gt; 	    /* Hereafter need only the first 2 widgets */
&gt; 	    free(wp + 2);
&gt; 	}
&gt;
&gt; In other words, is it reasonable to pass free() an address in the middle of
&gt; an allocated block, instead of the address of the start of the block?

<p>
No.  Quoting from the SGI man page, which is most handy:

<p>
     The argument to free is a pointer to a block previously allocated by
     malloc.

<p>
If you didn't get it with malloc(), you shouldn't feed it to free().
The reason for this is that malloc/free use a small data structure just
before the dynamic memory block is.  The contents are system-specific,
but often include things like:

<p>
*)  Forward and backwards links of free/busy memory blocks
*)  The size of the memory block.
*)  The busy/free status of the memory block.
*)  Magic numbers to check for pointer corruption

<p>
&gt; The
&gt; application was calling malloc() to get a starting chunk and then repeatedly
&gt; calling realloc() to double that amount as needed.  Since in the worst case
&gt; this approach will use twice the required memory, I thought I'd give back
&gt; what I didn't need.  I ended up dumping core, however, and inferred that
&gt; malloc()/free() might not be as sophisticated as I had assumed.

<p>
Or more sophisticated!  In this case, what you should be doing is
calling realloc() again to trim down the size of the block to exactly
what is needed.  Then the library will be able to shuffle the remainder
off to it's internal free list, building new headers & other internal
info as appropriate for that implementation.

<p>
Using realloc() to shrink the size of an allocation is not an expensive
operation, and won't move the actual data (although it would be safest
not to depend on that behavior).

Subject:  Re:  BRL-CAD drafting features
Message-ID:  &lt;9203201137.aa07010@WOLF.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
&gt; ... I have some questions regarding BRL-CAD's ability
&gt; to create production drawings.  The documentation mentioned some work
&gt; being done with automatic dimension, is anything available for 
&gt; incorporating into BRL-CAD?  Even a primitive (Beta) version would be
&gt; useful.  Also, is there a command to make BRL-CAD produce the drafting
&gt; drawings, or does one have to use seperate commands?  

<p>
What we have, so far, is RTHIDE, RTSCALE, and RTREGIS.

<p>
&gt;   Also, the documentation mentions a numerical milling program, is 
&gt; there a version of this avaliabe?  I would be very interested in one.  

<p>
Nope, sorry.

<p>
&gt;   I also was wondering what the vector font directory (vfont) was for,
&gt; is there some way to annotate the images, and what is libnurb for, 
&gt; does BRL-CAD have a method for produceing nurb solids, or does one
&gt; have to create those outside of BRL-CAD?  

<p>
vfont directory is used by CAT-FB, which puts troff output onto framebuffers
and image files, and FBLABEL which is used for annotating images, usually
from shell scripts.

<p>
libnurb is for the analysis of NURB solids.  We don't allow interactive
creation or editing of NURBS yet, but if you have a program that wants
to create a NURB, it's easy!  Look at proc-db/teapot.c for one example.

<p>
&gt;   These questions where some things I came up with while reading the
&gt; documintation and which I would like more information before I go to 
&gt; the effort of porting the package to my MAC.  Being in the NMR software
&gt; busness myself I can understand how easy it is to let the documentation 
&gt; fall behind.  

<p>
Actually, the documentation is in pretty fair shape.  Problem is, our
support contractor that was organizing all the camera-ready copy for
the printshop is now 6 months late in delivering, so all you users don't
actually HAVE the latest documentation. Sigh.  It's a 5 volume set now.

<p>
realloc() might or might not move the data and it might fail, even for a
request to shorten the allocation.  Standard-conforming implementations
of realloc() will not lose the original data when they report failure.
(Older implementations sometimes did.)  The programming idiom for this is:
	/* using p to refer to the start of the data block */
	if ( (np = realloc( p, new_size )) != NULL )	/* and only if */
		p = np;
	/* continue to use p to refer to the start of the data block */
(For clarity, I omitted details such as declarations, etc.)

<p>
An easy mistake to make is to store addresses within the previous data
block into various pointer variables (e.g. sparse-array links), then
fail to update them upon realloc()ation (probably because you didn't
leave yourself any way to find them!).  If you key off (base,offset)
instead, then updating just the base pointer to the data block is all
that is necessary to track a realloc()ation (the offsets don't change).

	ae 35 25
	size 4000
	knob x 1

<p>
On the Release 4.1 version of the code, I obtained 12.5 frames/sec,
while with the new version, I obtained 15.75 frames/sec.
(I might note that the new MGED also continuously monitors it's drawing
performance now, making it easy to read off frame rates).

Subject:  framebuffers under BRLCAD 4.0
Organization:  Doubly-Linked_List
Message-ID:  &lt;9201311849.aa23249@VMB.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
Paul,

<p>
	The lack of a shared memory framebuffer on the Indigo is not as
burning an issue as you might at first think.  The reason is that with
release 4.0 BRLCAD has "fbserv".  This is known as the "framebuffer server".
The idea is that you create a process which opens a framebuffer and handles
requests for that framebuffer.  This allows you to create 1 framebuffer window
for working with images, and removes the "popping window" syndrome.  One of
the great misfortunes of release 4.0 is that there is no man page for fbserv,
and the useage message is of limited help.  I will try to give a brief
overview here.

<p>
fbserv opens a framebuffer window and lingers around waiting to service
framebuffer requests.  An application opens this framebuffer and reads/writes
just like normal.  The difference is that when the application closes the
framebuffer the server does not close down the window and go away.  Instead it
goes back to waiting for new framebuffer requests.  The next application to
open framebuffer 0 gets the same fbserv, with the same framebuffer window and
display memory as before.  When the user finally wants to dismiss the
framebuffer entirely (ie: at logout time) the command "fbfree" will caues
fbserv to dismiss the actual framebuffer and then exit.

<p>
This method of operation has several advantages over previous methods of
operation.  The first is that the user gets a framebuffer window that doesn't
"disappear" as soon as the application closes the framebuffer (as is the case
with a framebuffer of "/dev/sgi").  Traditionally the workaround was to use
a "lingering" framebuffer.  The problem with this was that the window had to
be dismissed by the user after each use or there would be a buildup of
"duplicate" windows on the screen.

<p>
In addition to the "user interface" problem, there was the problem of using
"shared memory" to hold the image.  On many (if not all) systems, a shared
memory segment was not pageable/swappable. This meant that a single paint of a
1024x1024 image would lock up 3MBytes of main memory until a user explicitly
freed the shared memory segment.  Few people remember to do this.  On many
workstations, the loss of 3MB poses a severe penalty on system performance.

<p>
Finally, it is possible with fbserv to maintain 2 independent framebuffers on
the same system.  This can be useful for comparing images, or allow rendering
into one framebuffer while other images are viewed into a second.

<p>
Example:

<p>
	% fbserv -S 512 0 /dev/sgip &			# start server #1
	% fbserv -S 512 1 /dev/sgip &			# start server #2
	% setenv FB_FILE 1
 	% pix-fb -F 0 image.pix
 	% pix-fb picture.pix
 	% rt -a 35 -e 25 moss.g all.g &gt;& moss.log &
 	[1] 10671
	% setenv FB_FILE 0
 	% fb-rle image.rle
 	% jobs 	
	[1]  + Running  rt -s 512 -a 35 -e 25 moss.g all.g &gt;& moss.log
 	% 
	[1]    Done      rt -s512 -a 35 -e 25 moss.g all.g &gt;& moss.log 

<p>

<p>
It is important to note that "fbserv" can use any valid framebuffer name.
Fbserv works equally well on a sun, sgi, cray....

Subject: Frame Buffer (fb) Problems

<p>
I've got a problem running the fb routines on my SGI 4D/220.  The window
that the fb opens comes up and plots the image and then disappears as
soon as the image is complete (along with the image).  Any hints as to
how I can fix this?  Thanks.

<p>
Try "setenv FB_FILE /dev/sgipl" and then pix-fb.  The 'p' option means
private memory (not shared) and the 'l' means to linger, i.e. stay around
after the program that created the window has exited.  See "fbhelp"
for more information.

<p>
Another option is fbserv, which creates a reusable window.  E.g.

<p>
% fbserv -w720 -n486 0 /dev/sgip &
% setenv FB_FILE 0
% pix-fb -s512 file.pix
% fbzoom

<p>
etc.

<p>
You can have several fbserv's known as '0', '1', etc.  They work
remotely as well:

<p>
remotehost% setenv FB_FILE yourfbservhost:0
remotehost% pix-fb

<p>
[Not to be confused with the X11 setenv DISPLAY hostname:0, but the
 syntax is very similar.  If you are using the /dev/X frame buffer,
 you still need to set DISPLAY, xhost, etc.]

Subject:  Region ID Instance Filter installed in RIP
Message-ID:  &lt;9205150652.aa04620@WOLF.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
Thanks to Mike Muuss, future releases of LIBRT now can renumber instanced
region's item numbers.  I have recompiled a version of RIP that uses the
new LIBRT.  You will need a file that contains regular expressions like
those used in ED(1) that will be used to match region path names and remap
their region ids. The file should have the same base name as your database
file but with a ".regexp" suffix (e.g. target.regexp for the file target.g).
Comments may be placed in the regular expression file on lines beginning
with a '#'.  The following is an example:

<p>
#
# Each of the following lines follows the format:
#
#	Regular_Expression	TAB(s)	command SEMICOLON
#
# Examples of valid "command"s for remapping region ids are:
#
#	99	replace old region id with 99 (or any number)
#	+99	increment old region id by 99 (or any number)
#	+uses	increment the old region id by the
#		current instance (use) count
#
# Note that all regular expressions from ed(1), the line editor, are supported
# Note that all commands MUST end with a semicolon ";"
# Note that all backslashes have to be doubled.
# Note that ., \, [, and * are special pattern matching characters
# Blank lines are not significant.
# Commands may extend over multiple lines -- they are terminated only by ";"
#
# Note that the regular expression may specify as much or as little
# of the full path name as needed to get the desired effect.
#
# The order that commands are given is significant, if
# several regular expressions select the same region.
# 
# These lines demonstrate all currently supported features.

<p>
# discriminate between each instance of block.r
/b./block\\.r           +uses;
# ditto for sph.r
/s./sph\\.r             +uses;

<p>
# For fourth instance of block.r only, go back and force the region ID to 321.
/b4/block\\.r           321;

<p>
# For the third instance of sph.r only, go back and add 42 to prev. result
/s3/sph\\.r             +42;

<p>
#
# Note that the above database had a tree that looked like:
#
#mged&gt; tree all.g
#all.g/
#        u floor.r/R
#                u floor

<p>
# 	I think "+++paul" has brought up a good point, in fact, why not make
# the lingering frame buffer the default.

<p>
I'll tell you why.  The lingering frame buffer support is an ugly kludge
that has serious consequences for interactive libfb clients like 'lgt' and
'fbed'.  When the libfb/fbclose() function is called from an interactive
program specifying a 'lingering' window, the client gets killed off.  I have
spent mega-hours answering calls from people whose 'lgt' run gets killed
when they close a lingering window.  Note that specifying a remote device
(ie remote-host:/dev/sgipl) or using 'fbserv' is safe because the lingering
window is a remote process, not a child of the client process.

<p>
# How often does one want a frame buffer that disappears as soon as its
# displayed??

<p>
Not very often.  Fbserv is definitely the way to go.  Unfortunately, the
man page didn't get distributed (an oversight apparently), and the inetd
configuration is not part of the automatic BRL-CAD installation as far as
I know.  Getting fbserv properly installed and learning to use it is not
a big deal and is definitely worth the trouble.  There is the drawback
that you can't get a remote fbserv window to resize itself from the client
application, but this usually is not a big hardship for the user.

<p>
Gary mentioned a couple of reasons for not defaulting to lingering
windows.  I would add to that that if you are using shared memory
windows for compositing or what have you, you may not want a stack
of windows to pile up on the screen (easy to do).  And while lingering
may be more common for pix-fb, it often isn't correct for other
programs that use frame buffers (take fbzoom for example).  [I have
however considered suggesting that private memory become the default
(rather than shared).  I almost *never* use shared any more.  fbserv
is usually better if you need to do the things shared memory buys you.]

<p>
I think a big problem is that answers to FAQ's like this are very
hard to find in the documentation.  How to use fbserv is almost non
existant (my fault, since I wrote fbserv and didn't "finish" the job),
and there are other charms in there like memory frame buffers with
and without attached displays that let you do some neat things.

<p>
I have wanted to write a tutorial example on using these features
for many months now.  I think having such examples would help first
time users (and even others) a lot.

Today I added a new addition to the converter directory: it is a shell
script that will "compact" mged databases.  It takes two arguments: the
database to be compacted and the new database.  These two arguments must
be different.  The objective is to remove allocated space that remains
when a component is killed.  The program relies on g2asc and asc2g to do
the actual compacting.  

<p>
Beware: at this time there is no provision made to cover the following
situation.  When one of the converters skips a solid/solids, then the
database is also "compacted", and the solids skipped by the converters are
are omitted.

COMPARISON BETWEEN BLACK HAWK COMPONENTS HIT BY SMALL ARMS PROJECTILES
     IN GRENADA AND GEOMETRIC MODEL INTERROGATION PREDICTIONS

<p>
Interrogations of the three dimensional graphical model for The BLACK HAWK,
UH-60A, were made along the same 7.62mm projectile hit shotlines
encountered during "OPERATION URGENT FURY", the Grenada rescue mission. The
combat damage data results were compared with the predictions from the
Geometric Information For Targets (GIFT) code for the same shotlines
encountered in combat. A total of 26 shotlines were examined
from two helicopters involved in the conflict. The results of the GIFT code
output correlated well with the actual combat damage. The results of this
comparative study will be presented in a paper at the US Army Thirtieth
Operation Research Symposium (AORS XXX) to be held this November at Fort
Lee, VA. POC: Dr. Don Haskell, Ext. 2032.

  INTERACTIVE SCREEN EDITOR STYLE COMMAND DEVELOPED FOR BRL-CAD'S MGED

<p>
The BRL-CAD, the Army's primary solid modeling system, is used by the BRL,
other government agencies, and private industry.  Its graphics-based user
interface, MGED (Multidevice Graphics EDitor), now can be upgraded to
employ screen editor-like capabilities in editing building blocks (called
regions and groups) of models.  Users can select from a variety of familiar
screen editor environments such as "jove," "emacs," or "vi" to define or
modify region and group definitions. Heretofore, users were forced to
execute the "r" (region) or "g" (group) commands whose data inputs were
completely free of syntax and model construction errors.  The occurrence of
an error in one of these commands often would require the user to
completely retype the command and inputs.  Now the new command "red"
(Region EDitor) will invoke the user's choice of screen editor and allow
the user to modify group and region definitions as easily as editing a
simple file. POC: Donald Haskell, Ext. 2608.

<p>
For the first evening this week, I actually got to do some programming,
and I finished my first cut at interactive editing of NURB solids
in MGED.  It is now possible to interactively select a surface and
control point, by pointing and clicking with the mouse, and then draging
that control point around on the screen.  The spline surface follows
along beneath it.

<p>
My thanks to Mike Markowski for creating two support subroutines to assist
with the point picking.

<p>
I'd be happy to show it folks.  I've created a really deformed teapot
with almost no effort... You can see for yourself in
wolf:/m/cad/.mged.5d/ugly-teapot.pix (512).

<p>
The user interface needs some refinement before I'd turn anyone loose
on it, but all the pieces are there now.  (Finally).  I've been waiting
years to be able to do this!

<p>
I agree with Lee Butler.  Factors are:

<p>
1) If there is a lot of constant color, run length encoding (RLE)
   really wins.  See the Utah Raster Toolkit utilities (included
   in BRL-CAD).
2) For general images (e.g. with noise or lots of varying colors),
   general compression techniques (such as compress/uncompress) work
   every bit as well as "image" techniques for the lossless case.
3) Sometimes it helps to do color separations first, and then compress.
4) If you don't need lossless compression, there are some very good
   image oriented compression techniques available (e.g. JPEG).

<p>
Around here we use compress/uncompress a lot.  It's lossless, and
in general works as well or better than RLE (but slower).

Message-ID:  &lt;9208191721.aa06541@VMB.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
Just a warning that I updated VOTE with MIT's official patches 11-13.  I
I have been using this software for several weeks so it should be fine,
but you may notice a large number of Sun4 files being updated via rdist;
it's just a side-effect of rebuilding the core MIT X11R5 distribution.

<p>
Included in this update is the xrolo utility (mimics the functionality
of a rolodex).  I installed this because Jill asked for such a capability,
but I haven't got the time to test it out properly, so use at your own
risk (as usual ;-) and let me know if there are any problems.  I noticed
that it dumps core immediately on Sun3s, but so do many other xview
clients.  Apparently, the xview library has problems there, so I am not
making it available at this point in time on Sun3s.

<p>
Finally, I installed xpa on VOTE; this is the X11 front end to my presented
area, mass, moments and products of inertia, etc. program.  The ray-tracing
back end for xpa is called "paslave" and lives under /usr/vld/bin; it is
typically run on a different host than the X11 part and is installed on
some of the SGI servers.  These programs (xpa/paslave) are experimental
meaning that I have tested the results to the best of my ability, but it
is the user's responsibility to convince himself that the answers are
correct.  I just do not have the resources to come up with a robust set
of test cases with known answers for moments and products of inertia.  It
works for simple test cases (ie a cube), and there is no reason to suspect
that the complexity of the MGED region should make any difference, but
"caveat emptor" anyway.

Mike Markowski also noticed this.  On the occasions it's been noticed, it
seems to be related to an unusual state of the graphics engine.  Applying the
"Vulcan Death Grip" (simultaneous Lctrl,Lshift,F12,keypad-/) to reset the
graphics hardware seems to correct the problem.  If you can come up with a
repeatable test case, please let us know.

The short answer is that you didn't miss anything while you were sick.
I hope you are feeling better now!

<p>
The files to read in preparation for doing something with NMGs are
h/nmg.h, librt/nmg_*.c, librt/g_nmg.c, and mged/dodraw.c

<p>
For an example of some code that creates an NMG object, you might
examine librt/g_arb.c: rt_arb_tess() and librt/g_ell.c: rt_ell_tess().
I don't promise that either are "clean" or the "best" way to accomplish
that task, but they arn't bad, and work.

<p>
You are welcome to consider either the Release 4.0 versions, or the
latest sources from wolf:/m/cad, although I note that the later may be
in a state of disrepair on occasion, as Lee and I are working hard on
the code, between briefings, TDY, and other excitement provided from on
high.

<p>
After you've spent a little while looking around, it would probably be
appropriate to get together and chat for an hour or two some afternoon,
to answer whatever questions have come up.

They specify the size of the input file.  For a more full description
of these options (which show up on almost every image processing command
in BRL-CAD), run "man brlcad".  That man page documents the overall

I can not reproduce this error on Irix 4.0.5, but do recall the exact
same trouble when we were running 4.0.1.  The fix is to put the Font
Manager Library ( libfm_s.a ) before the other libraries:

<p>
./cad/edpix/Cakefile:
20c20
&lt;       CC LDFLAGS -o edpix OBJ LIB_PRE''LIBRLE -lgl_s -lfm_s LIBES
---
&gt;       CC LDFLAGS -o edpix OBJ -lfm_s LIB_PRE''LIBRLE -lgl_s LIBES

<p>
I believe the C compiler is going through some groing pains?  At leaset
it has had other difficulties between 4.0.1 and 4.0.5 so for now I will
blame it.  Let me know if the problem persists.

<p>
It seems like external interest in animation using BRL-CAD is suddenly
picking up:

<p>
&gt; From: "Kenneth H. Fielding" &lt;kfieldin@afit.af.mil&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to generate say a 10 frame sequence where I can define
&gt; scale, orientation, and position for the object in each frame.  The  
&gt; frames can then be ganged together to make a "movie".
&gt; 
&gt; what is the easiest and most straight forward way to do this in  
&gt; either "rt" or "lgt"?

<p>
&gt; From:     "Gary S. Moss" (VLD/VMB) &lt;moss@BRL.MIL&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know the easiest way.  Hopefully, if tools exist to do in-betweening
&gt; or other useful steps in generating smooth animation sequences, someone else
&gt; will speak up.  I recall some buggy frame-interpolation software that used
&gt; to be available at BRL, but it was never made available for general use.

<p>
I'm not sure what software Gary is making reference to, but in Release
4.0 you will find the two primary tools that I have used for making
animations:  TABINTERP and TABSUB.  They don't have manual pages at the
moment.

<p>
TABINTERP is a table-based interpolator that can take an arbitrary
collection of columns from an arbitrary number of input files, and
resamples them using a selection of interpolators (including spline).

<p>
TABSUB is a macro processor especially suited for generating RT
animation scripts from the output of TABINTERP.

<p>
Keyframes can be specified using MGED, by hand, or using an external
program.  I've done it all three ways.

<p>
Once an animation script has been prepared, it can be fed to either
RT or REMRT on stdin by giving the -M flag on the commandline.  All
frames will be computed in sequence, with "checkpoint-restart" handled
automaticly, so that the machine going down won't cost you more than a
few pixels of the final result.

<p>
Note that the RT animation script facility can BOTH (a) move the
eyepoint around stationary geometry, and (b) articulate the geometry
at any number of arcs in the database DAG (tree).  For example, the eye
(camera) could by flying, while a rotation was being superimposed on the
arc tank.g/turret.g.

<p>
Lee Butler has a draft of a paper on how to use this capability.  It
is not complete, but should serve as a useful baseline.  Contact him
at &lt;butler@brl.mil&gt;.

<p>
Also note that there is a tutorial session on using this capability
being given by Chris Johnson at the BRL-CAD Users Conference this week.
Contact the conferenct at 800-466-4862 for info.  While I have not seen
his presentation materials, he has produced quite a number of successful
animation sequences using the RT animation capability, so his talk
should be quite informative.

<p>
I'm sorry that there isn't more written about this stuff, but writing
takes time.  After you have looked over the intro materials, I'd be
happy to send you an example of a simple animation.

<p>

Subject: perspective switch for MGED

<p>
At the BRLCAD conference it was demonstrated that their is a toggle switch
for perspective viewing in MGED.  On the SGI machines I beleive it was F2
or F3.  One of the other keys could then be used to flip through the
major perspective angles (90,60,30).

<p>
I have tried to put MGED into perspective viewing mode, and it doesn't seem to
work.  We have BRLCAD running on SPARC IPX.  Is perspective viewing supported
for the SUN running X?  If so, what is the keystroke to turn it on?

Message-ID:  &lt;9211161536.aa21053@WOLF.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>

<p>
&gt; The perspective viewing mode is not available under X.  The reason is that
&gt; the perspective is generated in the view module of mged.  Under the sgi
&gt; view module each vector is passed through a (hardware) matrix multiply. 
&gt; There is no such manipulation in the X window support.

<p>
The details here are incorrect. In Release 4.0, the perspective is
generated in the SGI-specific display manager module mged/dm-4d.c (*not*
the view module).  Both the SGI and the X display managers already
transform each vector by a 4x4 transform matrix.  But the conclusion is
right -- in Release 4.0, there is no perspective viewing on the X
interface.

<p>
However, in the development version of MGED, perspective support has
been pushed up into the "top half" of the display interface, and thus
automaticly operates properly on X displays, and all other displays.

<p>
No function key has been assigned on the X display yet, but keyboard
commands can be used to assign the viewing angle, like:

<p>
	set perspective=90
and
	set perspective=42.5

<p>
It can be turned off (orthoview) with

<p>
	set perspective=0

<p>
Something to look forward to in the next release.
	Best,

<p>
I'm just guessing, but it could be that you need to make sure the mouse
pointer moves into the framebuffer window.  Since the X server will probably
need to load a new color map for that window, you may not see anything until
the mouse is in the window.

<p>
Taking another stab in the dark, can you display one of the pix files that
came with BRL-CAD?  Try:
	 pix-fb -F /dev/Xl  brlcad/pix/moss.pix

<p>
Since I don't have a Mac to try this on, I can't offer much else.

Jim,

<p>
The most likely problem you are having with your X display under A/UX
(assuming that you are using MacX) is that you are using the wrong screen. 
The method that I use is:
        Make a version of libfb under A/UX that has X support compiled in.
                (There is a #if 0/1 in /m/cad/Cakefile.defs to do this)
        cd /m/cad/libfb
        cake clean; cake libfb.a
        cd ../fbserv
        cake
        (install fbserv)
        edit /m/cad/Cakefile.defs to change the frame buffer support to no
X)
        cd /m/cad/libfb;cake clean; cake libfb.a

<p>

<p>
Once fbserv is installed, try the following:
        DISPLAY=localhost:0.2;export DISPLAY
        fbserv -F/dev/X 0&
on your sun:
        FB_FILE=mac_name:0;export FB_FILE
        pix-fb /m/cad/pix/world.pix

<p>
This should work.  Be aware that color support is not very good for X yet.

<p>
Responding to the suggestion of Tom Sullivan of SANDIA at the recent

VDECK to support the creation of .cg files containing more than 9999
solids.  This can be important for the calculation of radar signatures
of certain large geometry files on Sandia's parallel machines.

Here is the RCS log entry:

Subject:  libfb autosize

<p>
Following up on a remark that Chris Johnson made at the BRL-CAD User's
Conference, and motivated by having to process some SIGS images, I have
expanded the autosize functionality of LIBFB (usually obtained with the
"-a" flag on programs) so that if the image is exactly square (of any
dimension), it will autosize.

<p>
This means that, e.g., 1800x1800 or 200x200 images or 52x52 images
will all autosize, without having to add those sizes to the
table.

<p>
Something to look forward to in the next release.

Subject:  'f' option to /dev/ab (LIBFB)
Message-ID:  &lt;9301062313.aa08331@WOLF.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
This evening, I added an 'f' option to the LIBFB routine if_ab.c, so
that instead of writing .YUV data over the EtherNet to a network
connected Abekas, the .YUV data is written into a disk file.

<p>
For example, the command:

<p>
	pix-fb -F /dev/abovf@prefix#42 dragon.pix

<p>
will create the disk file:

<p>
	prefix42.yuv

<p>
When the 'f' flag is given, what is usually the host name (following
the '@') is now interpreted as a prefix string, which may include
slashes to indicate a full path.  The suffix of ".yuv" is always
provided.

<p>
Similarly, the command

<p>
	fb-pix -F /dev/abvf@/tmp/#42 newfile.pix

<p>
will read the (framebuffer) disk file "/tmp/42.yuv" and store it in
"newfile.pix".

<p>
This new option should allow more efficient use of disk space when
creating animations destined exclusively for an Abekas, because
.YUV files are smaller than .PIX files.  Also, if frames are stored
in .YUV format, they can be bulk loaded to the Abekas without having
to pay the 4-seconds per frame processing time for converting .PIX to
.YUV.  The transmission then becomes simply:

<p>
	rcp *.yuv abekas:

<p>
This also makes it easy to write Abekas backup/restore formatted 8mm
Exabyte tapes directly from the UNIX host.  The Abekas loads images
about twice as fast from the Exabyte as it does over the Ethernet.
That, plus the advantage of getting a tape backup copy as a "free"
by-product, makes this attractive for longer animations.  More on this
in some future note.

so that all the pixels are converted.  (The default is -s512, which

<p>
Many brl-cad users have been interested in extruding into 3d an arbitrary
polygon or in adding thickness to faceted objects.

<p>
Yesterday I finished a subroutine that given an NMG face and a vector, will
extrude the face based on the direction and magnitude of the vector.  The
routine handles a single face of one or more loops.  This is the 1st step
towards a routine allowing general (multiple face) extrusion of faceted
objects.

<p>
Stay tuned,

Subject:  Hidden Line Drawings and Plot Files
Message-ID:  &lt;9301200957.aa04781@WAFFLE.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>

<p>
At a recent meeting it was asked how to produce HPGL or Postscript 
files for line plots (hidden line drawings). Since it seems to of general
interest in the community I thought that I would give a brief description
on how to do this.

<p>
The first phase is to get a plot file made. I will use the m35 truck 
found in the database to illustrate on how this is done. 

<p>
To get a top view of the m35 truck made into a plot file
you can use the rthide command. 
	rthide -o top.pl -s 1024 -a 90 -e 90 m35.g component 

<p>
This creates an Extended Unix Plot file, the extended Plot format allows
for 3D data, color, space bounding boxes, etc. You can look in the libplot
directory for more info. 

<p>
We now need to Rotate the plotfile, Scale it, convert it to the standard
Unix Plot format.

<p>
	plrot -a 90 -e 90 -g top.pl | pl-pl -S &gt; top2.pl

<p>
The plot file is now ready to convert to a number of different formats
and there are several converters, 
	pl-tek		Plot to Tektronix
	pl-ps		Plot to Postscript
	pl-hpgl		Plot to HP GL format
	pl-fb		Plot to BRLCAD Frame buffer

<p>
If you want hpgl then do 

<p>
	pl-hpgl &lt; top2.pl &gt; top.hpgl

<p>
I tested the above including sending the top.hpgl to our
Tektronix Phaser III in hpgl mode. 

<p>
You will want to look at the man pages for details on each of the 
above programs.

<p>
The following script can be used to generate a side view of the database

<p>
and can be called by

<p>
	side.sh m35.g component

<p>
----------------------------- side.sh ---------------------------

<p>
#!/bin/sh

<p>
PATH=/usr/brlcad/bin

<p>
rthide -s 512 -a 90 -e 0 $1 $2 | plrot -a 90 -e 0 -g \
	| pl-pl -S | pl-hpgl

<p>
-----------------------------------------------------------------

<p>
Hope this helps.

<p>
Along the way I re-learned that eu-&gt;eumate_p-&gt;vu_p is not at all
the same as RT_LIST_PNEXT_CIRC(edgeuse,eu)-&gt;vu_p -- the vu's UP pointer
is in the faceuse of *opposite* orientation in the first case, and
the correct orientation in the second case.  Important difference,
even if the first formula is easier to type.

<p>
&gt;    I just got my 4.0 documentation, and after just scanning through
&gt; it looks pretty impressive.  I think everyone did a good job.  

<p>
Thanks!  It's also good to know that the boxes are making it through
the mail, too.

<p>
&gt; On to the actual topic.  I was very impressed by the complexity of
&gt; some of the models displayed (created in mged), and I thought it would
&gt; be a big help in learning how to design complex models if I had one
&gt; or two of these to play with and see how they were built. 

<p>
Probably the best way to gear up a staff for a large model building
task would be to contact one of several companies which provide BRL-CAD
training courses, and take a class.  CSG model building is a little
bit different than traditional modeling, and the current documentation
is not oriented towards this.

<p>
A lack which we are aware of.  There are plans afoot to have more
documentation created, but it won't be in the hands of end-users for
at least another year.

<p>
&gt; So, is
&gt; it possible to get via ftp some of these models, like the M1A1 
&gt; and/or the Bradley.  

<p>
There are some restrictions on what geometric models can be distributed,
and there is a small handling fee associated with acquiring each model
and it's supporting documentation.  Please contact Keith Applin at
410-278-6647 &lt;keith@brl.mil&gt; for information about what models are
available, and what the distribution arrangements are.

<p>
On the other hand, you might want to examine the "db/" directory in
BRL-CAD Release 4.0 -- it contains a railroad tank car (db/tank_car.asc)
and a Havoc 'chopper (db/havoc.asc), both very nice looking models
which were provided courtesy of Harry Reed, Geometric Solutions Inc.

&gt; 
&gt;   Does the "ev" command work in the 4.0 version of meged.  When I
&gt; use the command the whole program quits.  

<p>
In the 4.0 Release, the "ev" command does occasionally work, but only on
exceedingly simple cases.  It is provided more so that interested
developers can examine the code to learn more about how the NMG
routines can be used, than to provide an end-user service.

<p>
We felt it important to ship Release 4.0 with a non-working NMG library
so that users could take advantage of the many other improvements and
optimizations it contains, rather than delaying the rest of the software
a substantial length of time (years, as it has turned out). The
maintenance release will provide a functional NMG library.

<p>
Expect this pattern to recur.  Release 5.0 will probably have initial
support for trimmed-NURBS (t-NURBS), and in Release 5.1 the t-NURBS
support will be complete.

Subject:  nmg_esplit() arg change
Message-ID:  &lt;9302200602.aa10899@WOLF.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
In preparation for doing code review on the first set of modules which
comprise the NMG support library, I encountered the routine nmg_esplit(),
the function of which was difficult to describe.

<p>
To make the function more precise, easier to understand, and much easier
for calling routines to use, the second argument was changed from
being an edge to an edgeuse (of that edge), and the return code was
changed from being an edge to an edgeuse, also.

<p>
The new calling sequence is:

<p>
struct edgeuse *
nmg_esplit(v, eu)
struct vertex	*v;
struct edgeuse	*eu;
{
}

<p>
This routine was only used by internal routines, and in only a few
places, so the change was not disruptive.  Furthermore, in every
instance, the previous call had been

<p>
	nmg_esplit( v, eu-&gt;e_p );

<p>
so changing that to be

<p>
	nmg_esplit( v, eu );

<p>
was no hardship.  Since this routine is mentioned in the documentation,
there is a slight chance that other code developers have written
something which makes use of it.  That is the purpose of this message,
to warn of the impending change.

<p>
Both the compile time argument checking (on ANSI C compilers) and the
customary NMG library's run-time argument checking (on all systems)
will assist in swiftly isolating any non-library code which needs to
be modified to deal with this change.

<p>
	The presented area calculated with a view normal to the cutting
plane would be the area of the cross-section provided that the projection
of the rest of the object does not spill into places outside of the
2-d regions defined by the planar cut.

<p>
	There may be elegant MGED solutions to this in place, but I
don't know of them.

<p>
	If you are planning to get a good approximation--one which
avoids the problem mentioned above, you can make a second planar cut
parallel and near to the first and subtract the backside of the region
before making the presented area calculation. That will improve your
chances of getting the area of the slice of baloney of interest.

<p>
Yes, I got the cross-section in a test I just ran with a 1-inch cube.
At azim 0 & elev 0, I was looking head on at one of the faces (with
another face being flush with the ground), and at that view "area"
gave me 1 square inch.  Then I went to azim 45 & elev 0, and "area"
gave me square-root-of-two (about 1.414) square inches.

<p>
I also don't know what I'd do to pass a different cutting plane through.
The best I could do would be to delete (using "d") objects which project
beyond the area I want to see.

<p>
Another test with the cube was to go back to azim 0 & elev 0 and hollow out
a portion of it so that what's left looked something like:

<p>
*****                 *****
*   *    instead of   *****
*****                 *****

<p>
and I still got 1 square inch.  Notice that the face which is showing
still has all its edges intact.  I then expanded the subtraction so
that part of one of those edges was chopped off:

<p>
*   *
*   *
*****

<p>
and that reduced what "area" gave me.  "area" is obviously ignoring holes
except for holes which cut into the outer edge.

The algorithm which is used by the BRL-CAD software is based on
algorithms found in the SigGraph 1990 paper "Ray Tracing Trimmed rational
Surface Patches" by Nishita, Sederburg, Kamimoto, The routines are 
a combination of librt and libnurb. The libnurb routines are included in
the librt library. 

<p>
A sample data base can be generated by using the teapot program found in the
proc-db directory. 

<p>
Currently the Nurb raytracing routines do not handle trimmed nurbs. 
Eventually there will be support for trimmed nurbs as part of the 
NMG routines.  At the time of the last BRL-CAD meeting the libnurb
library routines were still in a state of change. I hope to have some 
documentation on the libnurb library before the next release.

It was short work to mutate that program into "pcd-pix", and that

Basically, any machine that can mount a CD-ROM with High Sierra (ISO 9660)

Message-ID:  &lt;9303221615.aa07919@VAT.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
	Dr. Walbert has agreed to provide funding for me to TDY to the IPO
meeting in Nashville the week of April 4.  If both of you are agreeable, I would
like to attend.

<p>
	Mike, I haven't had a chance to talk to you about IGES, but there are a few
problems with the standard for a hybrid system with boolean trees (like BRLCAD).
One problem is that the CSG standard has a limited vocabulary of primitive solids,
and in particular cannot handle our TGC, polysolid, or arb8's with non-right angles.
When Earl and I heard about the BREP standard, we thought that these solids could be
handled by making them BREP objects. Unfortunately, when the new standard came out,
the CSG boolean trees were prohibited from containing BREP objects, so we are still
stuck. It seems to us (Earl and me) that the solution is to remove the restriction
on CSG boolean trees and possibly enrich the CSG vocabulary.

<p>
	Another concern is that the same people who developed IGES are developing PDES.
If we don't do something now, we are likely to end up with the same problems on PDES.
This meeting in Nashville is a combined meeting of both the IGES and PDES people and
is a convenient oppurtunity to start pushing those people around to "correct" thinking.

<p>

<p>
I put the defaulting into MGED where "preview" uses the current
MGED view if none is given in the script.  Lets you preview
animations from any angle, and saves the need to put view specs
in your scripts.

Here is a copy of NCD rgb.txt which contains lots of colors.  Could
you replace this file with one that we currently have for rdist?

Subject:  Another animimation bug - fixed
Message-ID:  &lt;9304060043.aa24911@SPARK.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
John found another bug today: If you change the view parameters
from frame to frame, RT gives the wrong results (i.e. the wrong
view), while MGED was correct.

<p>
What was happening was that since you can either set the width/height
(via -n -w; or set width=xxx) or the cell_width/cell_height (via
-g -G; or; opt -g -G), RT was checking for a zero value in one of
these pairs (to see which the user set), and computing the OTHER
pair based on the ones given.  If neither was zero, it did nothing
(assuming it has already been computed - which it was).  However,
in an animation, if you change the viewsize, or any of the above named
parameters, these values need to be recomputed.  This wasn't happening.

<p>
I added a cell_newsize flag to indicate when a new -g or -G was given,
and then ALWAYS do the grid computation code, choosing the version based
on cell_newsize.  Changes are checked into rt/ext.h, opt.c, worker.c.

<p>

Subject: BRL-CAD 4.1 MGED screen is BLACK ...

<p>
	I have just installed BRL-CAD 4.1 on an SGI SKYWRITER
(two graphics heads) running 4.0.5(A). The software was built to run
in /data3/brlcad..... 
 When I run MGED, useing one of the sample databases, the MGED 
window comes up, but no buttons show up on the left had side of the
screen. When I issue the B command to draw the database, the figure
flashes on the screen for about 1 scan then the contents of the window
goes black. The same for left/center/right button -  the figure
appears for about 1 scan and then the window contents goes to black
again. 
	Any suggestions as to the cause/cure???

<p>
The place to look is in "mged/dm-4d.c".  The problem may have to do with the
SKYWRITER's implementation of double/single buffered modes.  Since I don't
have one of these displays, I'm afraid I can't help much more than that.

<p>
I thought that I had announced the availability of "xpa", but perhaps
I never got around to it.

<p>
	This is an official warning that the products and moments of
	inertia calculation has not undergone extensive validation.
	If someone has an alternative means for checking the numbers
	for some fairly complicated geometries, I would appreciate
	if they would report their findings back to me. I did check it
	against simple test cases for which the answer could be easily
	computed by hand.

# I am hearing of an "xpa" utility which can be used for cross-section area,

<p>
Carl,
	Xpa computes presented area, not cross-sectional area.  It also
computes volume, mass, centroids, moments and products of inertia.

<p>
        Assuming you have /usr/X11/man in your MANPATH, you should be able
to type "man xpa" to get the documentation on it.  It is installed on the
SGIs and Suns that have the X11 and vld software rdist distributions.

<p>
Haah,

<p>
I'm running BRLCAD on an SGI with remote output to a color Sun running
X11R4.  MGED runs ok (except for some ugly color choices) and the
fb commands I tried (rle-fb and cell-fb) run correctly.  I manually
started fbserv on the Sun like this:

<p>
vacation&gt; fbserv -S 1024 0 /dev/X

<p>
with these variables set on the SGI:

<p>
DISPLAY=vacation.brl.mil:0.0
FB_FILE=vacation.brl.mil:0

<p>
Running rle-fb on an existing RLE file displays the proper image (I'm
using cell-fb output and the spectrum at the bottom looks correct).
The framebuffer window is using a private colormap.  However, if I run
fb-rle the new RLE file is always grayscale.  I ran rlehdr on the
original and new files and got identical results, altho the new files
are about one half the size of the originals.  I played around with
the '-c' option and it didn't make any visual difference.

<p>
The problem with rt is more serious.  If I run rt from within MGED or
directly from the command line it *seems* to work but I never get an
image in the framebuffer.

<p>
I grep'd on X11 in the BRLCAD man tree and only 4 files even metioned
X11 -- mged (reminding people to define DISPLAY), pl-X (display
UnixPlot in an X11 window), urt (getx11 program), and libfb (use -lX11
when linking X programs).  There's nothing about defining FB_FILE to
point to an X11 client, nor is there an fbserv man page.

<p>
Now that SGI has switched to X11, is there going to be a greater
emphasis on X11 support in BRLCAD?  People have been writing to this
list saying they can run BRLCAD on their Suns under OpenWindows and
other X-ish things, but distributed SGI-&gt;Sun support is weak.

<p>
Ferd,

<p>
Remember "fbhelp", it will show you frame buffer options.
Try /dev/Xm.  The "m" means that it allocates a 24-bit memory buffer
to hold the image info, even if the display has e.g. only 1-bit.
This way pixel readback (such as fb-pix) will get the right values,
otherwise the best you can do is read the scant bitplanes from the
X server.  [You might have found a real bug, but this may work around
it.]

<p>
The other way to get 24-bit readback is to use /dev/mem.  On the SGI,
you could do:

<p>
fbserv -S1024 0 "/dev/mem vacation:0" &
FB_FILE=0

<p>
[possibly with 'r' (pre-read), and/or 'w' (write-through) option on /dev/mem]
What this will do is to make a pseudo 24-bit frame buffer on the SGI in
memory, do all libfb operations there, and when an application exits (or
closes the frame buffer) the image will be flushed to any attached frame
buffers (in this case vacation:0).   Doing this also means that readbacks
will be far faster, since they now come from your SGI memory, rather than
the Sun.

<p>
Yes, fbserv, /dev/mem, /dev/X, mged dm-X, aren't well documented.  Point
noted.  I have a small tutorial somewhere on using fbserv.  I'll see if
I can find it and send it to the list.

<p>
About X support in MGED, little known features: In the drawing window,
certain keystrokes do things for you.
  0        zero "knobs" (translates and rotates)
  x, y, z  translate
  X, Y, Z  rotate
  f, t, b, l, r, R, 3, 4  preset-views (front, top, ...)

<p>

| emphasis on X11 support in BRLCAD?

<p>
On an SGI, GL still beats the pants off of X as the prefered way to
do graphics.  However, to do GUI's, X is the thing to do.  There is
a much much better MGED X driver in the works (which will also drive
GL windows).  Expect to see it this Summer.

Subject:  Combinations, Groups, and Regions
Message-ID:  &lt;9304050300.aa01682@SPARK.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
             Combinations, Groups, and Regions

<p>
New users of MGED are often confused over the differences and
relationships between "combinations", "regions", and "groups".
The latter two are special cases of a combination.  A lot of
the confusion in the documentation results from the history by
which we got to the present system.  Here is a "modern" way of
looking at the three(*).

<p>
The fundamental command for building combinations of objects is:

<p>
	comb name &lt;op1 member1&gt; [&lt;op2 member2&gt; ...]

<p>
Where the members are either other combinations or primitives (single
solids).  The first &lt;op&gt; is meaningless.  Many people use union (u),
but some argue that intersect (+) should be used. [To distinguish this
from a group perhaps??  I've never understood their reasoning.]

<p>
If all of the operations are unions, there is a shorthand version of the
above to make what is called a "group" (a combination of all unions):

<p>
	g name &lt;member1&gt; [&lt;member2&gt; ...]

<p>
The result of this command is *exactly* the same as having made a
combination (comb) with all union (u) operations.  I.e.

<p>
	comb name &lt;u member1&gt; &lt;u member2&gt; ...

<p>
Finally, any combination can have a "bit" set (i.e. have a property
of any combination enabled) that makes that combination what is known
as a "region".  The idea of a region is that it consists of one solid
piece of material.  That is, however it was constructed in the editor,
by combining any number of levels of primitive solids and combinations
together, this finally result is one identifiable piece (e.g. a machined
part perhaps).  A combination so identified as a region can have various
properties associated with it: its color, the type of material it is
made out of, a "region id", etc.  There is a special form of the
combination (comb) command that makes a combination with this region
property set:

<p>
	r name &lt;op1 member1&gt; [&lt;op2 member2&gt; ...]

<p>
An existing region or combination (where "combination" is used here
to refer to a non-region, even though technically a region is still
a combination) can have this "bit" turned on or off via:

<p>
	edcomb name regionflag [regionid air los GIFTmater]

<p>
Other ways of editing regions include:

<p>
	item name item# [air]		to change the region_id
and
	mater name [material]		to change the material

<p>
[regdef item [air] [los] [GIFTmaterial] - sets defaults for next "r" cmd]

<p>
Speaking of historical confusion, note that the following names all
refer to the SAME single value!:

<p>
  "region id", "region ident", "ident", "ident code", "item number", "item".

<p>
<hr>
(*) Why I call it modern, is that for quite some time only the "r"
    and "g" commands existed.  "comb" was added much later, yet in
    this authors opinion, is the most fundamental of the three.  You
    used to be able to be fast-and-loose about having regions that
    contain regions, so everything could be built with "r".  When
    the ray tracer became more precise about not allowing two physical
    pieces of material to occupy the same space (overlapping regions),
    it became important to have combination nodes that did NOT have
    the region property turned on, and could thus be freely used as
    members in other combinations.

In my note about Combinations, Groups, and Regions, I had said in

<p>
Mike Muuss corrected me here.  I remembered "comb" being added, in
part when I complained "If you can't have regions within regions,
how are you supposed to make a non-region combination?"  My reasons
for why it didn't used to be there were wrong however.  Here is a
better footnote:

<p>
(*) Why I call it modern, is that for quite some time only the "r" and
    "g" commands existed.  "comb" was added much later, yet in this
    author's opinion, is the most fundamental of the three.  VDECK and
    GIFT (the predecessor to RT) did not support things such as regions
    within regions, booleans above regions, and non-unions below regions.
    Therefore MGED did not have support for them.  Adding "comb" to MGED
    generalized and increased MGED's expressive power, but it also allowed
    a diversion from GIFT compatible databases.

Chances are that select() is not working correctly.  Look in
"libsysv/bsdselect.c".  If you are falling into the generic
System V code that does a "return(32-1)", you will see the
problem you described.  You need to see if your HP supports a
real select system call and enable it by changing the ifdef's
in that module.

As far as I know you are not missing anything with reguards to mged.
The 'big e' command has never worked (to the best of my knowledge) on
a torus (or an ars).  The error below is the normal reaction to 'big
eing' a torus (or an ars).  I don't know anything about the same error
with rt.  My experience with tori and rt is that everything seems to
work.

Subject:  BRLCAD to IGES translator
Message-ID:  &lt;9306020927.aa23838@WOLF.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
	I have completed the coding of a BRLCAD-to-IGES translator (g-iges).
The code has two mutually exclusive options (plus a few others):

<p>
		-f for facets (each region is converted to NMG's prior to
			output in IGES format).

<p>
		-c for CSG (each object is output in IGES format unless
			there is no corresponding IGES entity, in which case
			it is converted to NMG's and then output).

<p>
	The -f option is essentially Markowski's g-jack converter with
different output and some additions. This option is dependent on the
successful implementation of NMG booleans. One major issue with this
option is that IGES expects BREP objects to consist of one or more outer
shells with zero or more inner void shells, while BRLCAD combines all of
this into a single shell.  This issue is being shelved until we know
for sure whether BRLCAD will use the IGES version of shells.

<p>
	The -c option has been exercised on two real models - the MH60
and MH47 helicopters. The 3.8 Mb mh47.g file produces a 39 Mb, 484,000
line IGES file with all the ARS solids, 65% of the ARB's and 10% of the
TGC's converted to NMG's. Everything else is written to the IGES file
without conversion.  The 4.5 Mb mh60k.g file produced a 59 Mb, 735,000
line IGES file with similar statistics.  There are a few issues here:

<p>
	1. What to do with solids that are not in IGES and are not
	   tesselated (like the half-space solid).

<p>
	2. IGES cannot handle an object that is scaled. If a scaled object
	   that has not been "pushed" is encountered, it is translated to
	   IGES without the scale factor and the user is warned.

<p>
	3. I have not implemented the IGES right angle wedge (RAW) solid.
	   This is just a matter of whether it's worth the effort of
	   developing code to recognize if a BRLCAD arb meets the criteria
	   to be an IGES RAW.

<p>
	Issue #1 was not encountered in either of the two models converted.
Issue #2 was encountered in one region and safely handled by a "push"
command in MGED and then re-running g-iges.

<p>
	Both options produce an IGES file that includes object names
(using the IGES "name" entity), colors (using the IGES color entity),
and region flag, region id, air code, GIFT material code, los, material
name, and material parameters are included using the IGES attribute
entities.  The attribute entity sort of a free for all entity to assign
any attributes to any IGES object.  No other IGES translator will understand
my attribute entity unless they code my conventions into their translator.

<p>
	Obviously, the only verification I have done on this is visual
inspection of the output files.  Given the size of the files, the possibility
of overlooking a bug is not insignificant.  I propose upgrading the existing
iges-g translator to the same level as the new g-iges and using them to
help debug each other.  This would also give me a chance to become familiar
with the nmg "make" routines.

<p>
For those of you fans of VDECK, it was reported today that VDECK will
not compile on an SGI R4000 Indigo machine.  In the Release 4.1 sources
this can be worked around by removing line 162, which states:

<p>
int sortFunc RT_ARGS((const void * a, const void *b));

<p>
In the Release 4.0 sources (which probably won't work on an Indigo
anyway), remove line 137, which states:

<p>
static int sortFunc RT_ARGS((const genptr_t a, const genptr_t b));

<p>

/*              Bare Sun configuration */
You can switch to the OpenWindows support by changing the "if 1" for
the bare sun configuration to an "if 0".  This will enable the section
labelled:
/*              Sun with X11 (aka "openwin").  Default for SunOS 4.1.1 */

<p>

<p>
		Hope this helps,

You know, you *are* allowed to edit the Cakefile.defs entries, if they
don't suit your particular configuration.  I've tried to provide a
variety of useful selections via the #if mechanism, but once you have
the baseline package working, if you want to make modifications, do feel
free to do so!  One of the benefits (and responsibilities) of getting
software in source code form.

Hi,
	I'm interested in adding concurrent multi-user capability
to MGED.  I wanted to know if anybody had tried this, or if
anybody had any tips on how I might go about it.  I'm
somewhat familiar with designing multi-user programs, but I am not
familiar with mged yet.  Any suggestions, warnings, etc would be
greatly appreciated...

The new MGED user interface allows multiple X servers to be used
to display geometry.  The alternate displays are even mouse input
sensitive.  We have discussed the issue of whether or not to allow
complete editing capability from every display, and issues such as
whether or not to warp the mouse on one display as it is moved on
another.

<p>
I personally don't see much utility in making it multi-user beyond
seeing the output on multiple desktops and being able to interactively
point out objects/actions to others.  But I'm open to ideas.  How
would you use a multi-user geometric editor?  In something other
than a demonstration/teaching mode?  How would you handle control,
e.g. would all mouse clicks and key presses apply to every display
in a first-come/first-serve fashion?

&gt; The new MGED user interface allows multiple X servers to be used
&gt; to display geometry.  The alternate displays are even mouse input
&gt; sensitive.  We have discussed the issue of whether or not to allow
&gt; complete editing capability from every display, and issues such as
&gt; whether or not to warp the mouse on one display as it is moved on

<p>
where could I get this new MGED UI?  Sounds *very* much like what I'd
want...

<p>
&gt; I personally don't see much utility in making it multi-user beyond
&gt; seeing the output on multiple desktops and being able to interactively
&gt; point out objects/actions to others.  But I'm open to ideas.  How
&gt; would you use a multi-user geometric editor?  In something other

&gt; e.g. would all mouse clicks and key presses apply to every display
&gt; in a first-come/first-serve fashion?

<p>
well, that question has many long answers.  The basic idea is
collaborative design.  That's my current area of research.  There is
alot of work being done in collaborative/multi-user programs, and
there are several ways in which you can handle control.  One solution 
is to do it the way it would be done in a meeting with a whiteboard. 
have one "pen" and allow only one person to edit at a time.  Another
way, (which, in my opinion is the way it should be done) is to allow
people to have their own views of the 3D database, and allow them all
to edit at the same time, but allow for "selection" of objects, and
when somebody has something selected, nobody else can modify it.  It
would also be good to have a local instance running as well, which
would allow users to work on a small part of the design outside of
the main database, and then add it in when they want to show it to
people.  Of course, it would be very important for the designers to
also be speaking to eachother to prevent problems.  A masters student
at MIT named Li Shu did a good piece of work on collaborative cad and 
had a paper in CSCW'92...

<p>
hope that answers part of your question...

Subject:  Intergraph/BRLCAD Translator
Message-ID:  &lt;9306291404.aa28542@WOLF.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
	I just talked to Bill Seyfert regarding the Intergraph/BRLCAD
translator that TACOM and FSTC sponsored. He gave me a brief description
of the status:

<p>
	The translators were written for Intergraph version 1.4 and BRLCAD
version 3.7. Translation to BRLCAD converts about a half dozen equivalent
solids directly to BRLCAD and the remainder are facetized and converted as
polysolids.  The translators are now being upgraded to Intergraph version
2.1 and BRLCAD version 4.0, and that effort is nearly finished.  The
current software runs only on an Intergraph workstation, but Mr. Seyfert
is procuring Intergraph software that will run on an SGI, and then intends
to port the translators to the SGI platform.  Translation to Intergraph
is also possible.  For a successful translation to BRLCAD, the Intergraph
user must follow some simple rules in the construction of the Intergraph
model.  For example, the user must build a solid model (not just surfaces
hanging in space), and the user must utilize Intergraphs layer capability
to create groups with names in the resulting brlcad model.

&gt; I'm interested in adding concurrent multi-user capability

<p>
and Phil responded with some information about his new X interface
to MGED.

<p>
I have taken another approach in my team's "Virtual Reality for CAD"
project -- we support an arbitrary number of copies of MGED running,
and coordinate them via a program called VRMGR (Virtual Reality
Manager).  This permits multiple people to wander within a single
database, some using regular displays, some using stereo-capable
workstations, some using a workstation pair driving an HMD, and some
using an arbitrary number of workstations driving a "cave" display
surface.  Any combination is possible, and "overview" display stations
can also be instantiated, to see how the users are moving through
the virtual space.

<p>
Each MGED user has control over his own point of view, and can see the
other users as a simple wireframe "eye" token.

<p>
A prototype of this much is more-or-less working now, the real issues
of how to do distributed *editing* (rather than just viewing) remain
to be tackled.  Much of the infrastructure for that is already in place,
but there are some key issues in interface design and in MGED internals
that still need some work.

<p>
This is a low-priority project at the moment, but because it's fun it
gets continuing attention, and I have some big plans for this effort,
including integrating audio.

<p>
Naturally, a VR capability is most fun if you have polygons to render,
which makes the "VR for CAD" project take a distinct second seat to
the "finishing NMG Booleans" project....

<p>
There is a lot more that I could say about "VR for CAD".  I hope that
I've tantalized you a bit already!

<p>
     Thanks for your help on compiling brl-cad on my sun sparcstation
under openwindows.  I modified the Cakefile.defs a slight bit to
compile under the "Sun with X11 only" option, but I still have
problems.  mged works fine, except that it flickers horribly when
rotating, zooming, etc.  Is it true that it does not do double
buffering because it's running under X? 
     The main problem, however, is that rt doesn't work in mged. It 
just messes up the screen alot and leaves the screen in black and 
white mode when it stops.  Then if I re-attach X (or type fix), 
everything goes back to normal, except that I have lots of debree 
left on the screen where rt popped up a "window".

<p>
I've included the part of the Cakefile.defs file that I think is
relevant...

<p>
Sounds like you are using the raw Sun "pixrect" interface (/dev/sun),
rather than the X11 interface to the framebuffer.  You can verify that
this is in fact the case by running "fbhelp" from the shell once, and
examining the lower half of it's output (after the "=== Current
Selection ===") message.

<p>
&gt; I've included the part of the Cakefile.defs file that I think is
&gt; relevant...

<p>
This was very helpful.  Thanks!  Where you said:

<p>
/*            Sun with X11 (aka "openwin").  Default for SunOS 4.1.1 */
#             define  LIBFB_OBJS      if_remote if_ab if_X if_sun
#             define  LIBFB_CONFIG    -DIF_REMOTE -DIF_AB -DIF_SUN \
                      -I/usr/openwin/include -DIF_X
#             define  LIBFB_LIBES     LIBPKG -lsunwindow -lpixrect -lsuntool\
                       -L/usr/openwin/lib -lX11

<p>
remove the if_sun, -DIF_SUN stuff, so that it now looks like this:

<p>
/*            Sun with X11 (aka "openwin").  Default for SunOS 4.1.1 */
#             define  LIBFB_OBJS      if_remote if_ab if_X
#             define  LIBFB_CONFIG    -DIF_REMOTE -DIF_AB \
                      -I/usr/openwin/include -DIF_X
#             define  LIBFB_LIBES     LIBPKG \
                       -L/usr/openwin/lib -lX11

<p>
This will prevent you from accidentally getting the SunTools interface
by default.

<p>
Alternatively (requiring no recompilation), remember to set your
environment variable FB_FILE before starting up MGED or other BRL-CAD
tools.

<p>
csh:	setenv FB_FILE /dev/X
sh:	FB_FILE=/dev/X; export FB_FILE

<p>
I hope this helps.

	Try setting your framebuffer to X.  If you are using the Bourne
shell do:
	FB_FILE=/dev/Xl
	export FB_FILE
Or, if you use a csh do:
	setenv FB_FILE /dev/Xl

<p>
	Also, try the "fbhelp" command for more info.

I suspect that what Andre was really asking for was a pointer to the
examples on how to use MGED.

<p>
In Vol IV (MGED User's Manual), try looking at chapters 13 and 14,
then refer back to earlier chapters in that manual for details.

<p>
&gt; 	Since I haven't been receiving *any* responses to my questions, this
&gt; will be the last time I will post a general mailing to cad@brl.mil.

<p>
Well, I answered at least one of your earlier messages, at least to say
that you were welcome to ask away, and that the developers really could
not commit to answering such detailed questions with any kind of
promptness -- we have quite a few other things going on right now,
and being only 4, can't invest too much time providing help to folks
who obtained "no support" distributions....  I regret that we can't
offer more help, but we can't. If we provided each of our 800 user sites
even a few hours of help, we wouldn't have any time left for our own
projects.  I hope you can appreciate our limitation.

<p>
You are engaged in a difficult task (multi-user geometry editing).
There are many different strategies that you might adopt for
implementing this within MGED.  You have not made it entirely clear
what strategy you are considering, which makes it hard to provide
concise suggestions.

<p>
&gt; I also understand (I think) how the dbase works and when it is
&gt; accessed. 

<p>
This is one of the main benefits that you obtain from having the source
code -- you can study the code and figure things out for yourself.
I'm glad it is yeilding some of it's secrets to you, already. :-)

<p>
&gt; However, I am still in desperate need of getting in touch with
&gt; someone who "understands" how the actual memory management works and
&gt; perhaps why it was designed in certain ways in certain places...

<p>
I designed all the memory management;  if you have a specific question
that has a brief answer, I'll try to reply.

<p>
Much of the memory management code is more than 10 years old, and was
designed to run on PDP-11 processors with limited address space. Thus,
the notion of "database granules" (128 bytes each) which can be
processed one at a time.  This mode of operating is no longer necessary,
but not all the code has been converted yet.   So, you will see both the
"old way" db_get()/db_put() usage, as well as the "new way" usage of
db_get_external()/db_put_external() to move 'objects' between memory and
the ".g" database file.

&gt; 	In other words, how can I do something to the effect of "e
&gt; /tank/fuel" instead of either "e tank" or "e fuel" (which would
&gt; ignore matrices higher up in the tree)?

<p>
Ah, an easy one!  How about just doing "e tank/fuel" (or whatever the
partial path spec is).  That works.  Or, better still, see my remarks
below.

<p>
&gt; An even shorter short-ish mged hacking question:
&gt; 	from within db_put(), how can I find the complete pathname
&gt; of the solid being "put"?  

<p>
You can't do it, that far down in the library.  Best you can do is to
get the name of the object being written (dp-&gt;d_namep).  In any case,
this is what you actually need, because you should then go and search
the MGED solid table for all objects on the screen that refer to this
database item, and redraw those "involved" solids.  There is handy
support for this operation in the form of subroutine
replot_modified_solid() in file mged/dodraw.c

&gt; Let's try a yes/no version of the question: when db_put stores s214,
&gt; from accepting changes on /tank/computer/r213/s214, does that mean that
&gt; all references to s214 are changed?

<p>
Alas, he didn't succeed in making it yes/no.  Grin!

<p>
There are two kinds of editing in MGED:  "solid edit", which transforms
the parameters of a *leaf* node (solid) in the tree, and "object edit",
which modifies the 4x4 transformation matrix stored along one *arc* of
the tree.

<p>
So, if you did a solid edit on "s214", all instances of that solid would
change.  If you did an object edit on "/tank/computer/r213/s214" and
replaced the matrix at the arc "r213/s214", then only that instance
would change.

<p>
At present there is no way to specify changing an leaf-node's
paramter(s) in an object edit.  Instancing is primarily used for
repeating many copies of identical parts.  Some modelers (e.g. Harry
Reed & crew) tend to avoid instances, while others (e.g. Jim Hunt &
crew) couldn't live without them.

<p>
I agree that the instancing capability could be more flexible, but
that leads the discussion in the direction of a non-global name space
or an 'interpreted' database, neither of which are 'minor' changes to
the design of the system.  As it stands now, these lacks don't seem to
be a serious hindrance, so this is not a 'hot topic', although we do
kick it around from time to time.

I noticed the comments on instancing.  I have had cases where I "inherited"
instancing in a description, and I started getting annoyed when I tried to
display a low-level solid and it did not appear where I thought, due to my
missing a transformation at a higher level in the tree.  Solution: I set
up at least one transformation-free path leading down to each solid.

<p>
This two and a half day conference will cover many topics of interest to
users of the BRL-CAD Package. While other symposia have focused on
presenting results of research and various theoretical applications,
this conference will teach attendees how to use the power of BRL-CAD
to accomplish their own tasks.

<p>
Presentations, papers, and tutorials will focus on a variety of subjects
for users at all skill levels. Subject range from introductory materials
for persons new to CSG to more esoteric subjects such as generation of
synthetic images for the simulation of thermal and laser radar sensors.
Intermediate topics will cover such practical considerations as printing
images, animation, vulnerability analysis, and specific information on
tools such as MUVES, FRED, LIBRT and others.

<p>
The conference fee includes a superb banquet of New York Strip Sirloin
(vegetarian alternative available), spinach salad, crab bisque (A
Maryland speciality), vegetables and potato, and a wonderful strawberry
cheesecake, all served with red or white wine.  Two lunches, three
Continental breakfasts, numerous breaks, and a hospitality suite are
also provided with equally handsome comestibles.

Subject:  Re:  nearest edge algorithm
Message-ID:  &lt;9308131426.aa26554@WOLF.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
Ed,

<p>
&gt;	In your algorithm for classifying a point as in or out of a
&gt;face, Mike claims you look at the nearest edge.  How do you find that
&gt;nearest edge?  Do you assume the polygonal boundary is convex?  If
&gt;you use a similar approach to what was being described on the sphere
&gt;yesterday, you may have a problem.  

<p>
The current version of the algorithm is something like this:

<p>
Given:
	 a "plane point" in the plane of a face,
	 a set of edges in the plane

<p>
For each edge in the face, determine the point of closest approach (PCA) of
the edge to the "plane point".  Remember the edge/PCA pair with the smallest
distance to the "plane point."

<p>
iff the "closest" edge has its PCA along the length of the edge, or the "plane
    point" is on the edge:
	A) if the "plane point" is on the edge, declare it to be "on" the
		face", otherwise....
	B) Determine if the plane point is "left" of the use of the edge in
		the normal-ward use of the face.
		1) form the "left vector" for the edgeuse.
		2) form a vector from the endpoint of the edgeuse to the
			"plane point"
		3) form the Dot product of these two vectors.

<p>
			If the sign of the Dot product is positive or zero,
			the plane point is inside the surface area of the
			face, otherwise it is outside the surface area of
			the face.
			

<p>
iff the "closest" edge has its PCA at a vertex (end point) and the vertex is
    NOT coincident with the plane point:
	A) form the vector from the endpoint to the "plane point".
	B) for each edgeuse of the face which touches the vertex:
		form the unit "left" vector for the edgeuse, (which points
		in the direction of the face area WRT the edge).
	C) find the edgeuse whose left vector has the smallest Dot product
		with the vector to the "plane point."

<p>
			If the sign of the Dot product is positive or zero,
			the plane point is inside the surface area of the
			face, otherwise it is outside the surface area of
			the face.

<p>

<p>
Sorry, we have not had any opportunity to bring BRL-CAD up under Solaris
2.2, that I am aware of.  Your best bet would be to remove all LIBFB and
MGED display options from Cakefile.defs, and proceed from there.  Once
you get that working, adding back (say) X windows support shouldn't be
too hard.

<p>
That is to say, delete all lines starting with:

<p>
#	if 1
/*		Bare Sun configuration */
#		define	LIBFB_OBJS	if_remote if_sun

<p>
down through

<p>
#		endif
#	endif

<p>
Thats about 32 lines worth (judging by eye).

<p>
	I have added a routine called "nmg_break_long_edges" to "nmg_misc.c".
        This codes looks for situations as illustrated:

<p>
	    *-------&gt;*--------&gt;*---------&gt;*
	    *&lt;----------------------------*

<p>
        where one long edgeuse (the bottom one above) and two or more
        shorter edgeusess (the tops ones) are collinear and have the same
        start and end vertices.  The code breaks the longer edgeuse into
        ones that can be radials of the shorter ones. I ran into this
	situation in converting the "tankill" geometry.

&gt; i've just installed brl-cad on a sun4 system.
&gt; After compiling and installing everything right (?!),
&gt; i've got som problems :
&gt;                         1. how can i rotate a single 
&gt;                            solid, when i chose the rotate-
&gt;                            function in the edit-solid menu.

<p>
	Choose the solid to edit.
	Select rotate with the mouse.
	Then type 'p x y z'
		Where x is the rotation about the x-axis, y is the
		rotation about the y-axis, and z is the rotation
		about the z-axis.  For example 'p 0 0 -10' rotates
		the solid -10 degrees about the z-axis.  I find
		it easier to rotate about one axis and accept the
		edit and then do a rotation about the next axis.
		I do this because I can not keep straight which
		rotation comes first (I want to say it is about
		the z-axis).  Also I have trouble visualizing
		more than one rotation at a time.  The rotation
		must be accepted before another rotation is
		typed in.  For example if the following commands
		are issued.
			p 0 0 -10
			p 0 0 -20
		The result is that the solid is rotated -20
		degrees about the z-axis not -30 degrees.
	An alternate way is to use the sliders.  Select sliders
		and seven sliders appear at the top of the screen;
		xslew, yslew, zslew, zoom, xrot, yrot, zrot.  The
		solid may be rotated using xrot, yrot, and zrot.
		Click the mouse to the left or right of the rotate
		sliders to get the solid to rotate.  On my SUN this
		is extremely difficult I can't see the sliders (I
		had to log on to an sgi to read what they said).
		Select Zero Sliders to stop or click the mouse right
		in the middle of the slider.

<p>
I hope this answer helps.  I don't know anything about the second
problem you are experiencing.

I've had that problem before.  the way you fix it is by typing "fbhelp" (which
is in the fb directory).  It should tell you how to set env options that should
fix the problem.  I know you're on a sun4, but what os version are you using?
Sunview or OpenWindows or Solaris?  What options did you compile with?  I was
running Openwindows...

<p>
Sven Schroeter,

<p>
	There is a problem with selecting solids on a SUN machine using the
current version of BRL-CAD.  The general process of selecting a solid for
rotation is:

<p>
	1) Display the items on the screen that you want to edit or will need
	for determining how the solid of interest should be processed.  For
	example, if you want to rotate a cylinder and translate it to rest
	on the side of a box, then it may be interesting to not only
	display the cylinder, but the box as well.  When the cylinder is
	modified, then the immediate feedback of the box and cylinder (in its
	new rotation and orientation) will uickly confirm that the processing
	action on the cylinder was either a success or a failure.

<p>
	2) Select "solid edit" from the pop down menu.  This action will
	place you in solid edit state rather than the initial (base) viewing
	state.

<p>
	3) Since many different solids can be illuminated at one time, MGED
	expects you to select a particular solid for editing.  One selects
	a particular solid by moving the cursor up and down until the desired
	solid outline is either changed in color (red to white on an SGI
	machine) or is redrawn with a tripple line thickness.

<p>
	Once the solid you want to edit is highlighted by either of the
	previously mentioned methods, simply click on the center mouse
	button once to inalize the selection.

<p>
	4) Select rotate from the pop down menu and either type in the
	desired X, Y, or Z axis rotation, or use the sliders or graphics
	station peripheral control knobs.  Please note that if you type in
	an X, Y, or Z axis rotation value, you must exit rotation mode and
	re-enter rotation mode if a further rotation is desired.  Otherwise,
	the old (previous) rotation will be replaced by the new rotation as if
	the old rotation never occurred.

<p>
	5) Once rotated correctly, select the accept edit field in the pop down
	menu an the solid edit is complete.

<p>
	Two final points, I hope that you understand the difference between
solids, regions, and groups in a BRL-CAD CSG target description and that you
are not referring to regions or group items as some complex surface editors
often do.  Secondly, there are more direct and sometimes easier to use
methods for editing solids such as MGED's "sed" command that were not
discussed here.  As always, each method has its strengths and weaknesses.

<p>
	For a more indepth answer to your problem (if you want one), feel
ffree to call us at 1-800-598-BRLCAD (2752).

Thanks,

Er, yes, but the problem with the X interface is that you seem to need
xgl _v2.0_, which a lot of sites don't have (it's unbundled), and which
is not upwards compatible with the current xgl (v3.0).  This was a
sufficient deterrent to send me back to suntools.

Subject:  LIBFB Interface Change on ANSI compilers
Message-ID:  &lt;9309251113.aa20302@WOLF.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>

<p>
This evening, in an attempt to start porting BRL-CAD to our new SGI
Power Challenge machine running IRIX 5, I once again had to wrestle with
the issue of ANSI function prototypes for the routines in LIBFB.  We had
previously said that routines like fb_write() took arguments of type
RGBpixel[].  RGBpixel was a typedef for an unsigned char[3] array.  As
Doug Gwyn pointed out when I brought this up the last time, arrays are
not fundamental types in C, and so this construction can be a bit
awkward.

<p>
With the necessity for (and desireability of) using function prototypes
upon us, the difficulty presented by the old method was just too great.
So, in the name of simplicity, I converted all the pixel parameters
to type (unsigned char *), which more simply describes the "packed byte
array" in which pixels are stored.  This is better than saying "RGBpixel
pp[]" everywhere, which would have had to be dereferenced as pp[i][RED].

<p>
I've changed h/fb.h, all of libfb/, all of fb/, all of util/, and
odds and ends elsewhere to account for this change.  Next time I need a
break from working on NMGs I'll try to recompile all the sources, and
chase down any other code that needs to be modified as a result of this.

<p>
Not surprisingly, a lot of the fb/ code was already using arrays of
chars, so making this is proper way to do things actually fits well with
a nice chunk (but certainly not all) of our current practice.

<p>
I'm sure that there are some of you who will find this change to be
disturbing, because it implies that some existing code might not work
with the new LIBFB interface.  First, let me note that if you are
not using an ANSII C compiler, this is an invisible change.  And, if you
*are* using an ANSII C compiler, you can't get the benefits of function
prototypes without this change.  Function prototypes are no panacea, but
I'm sufficiently pleased with their utility to insist that they be used
on all major interfaces.

<p>
I converted about 60 complete source modules in the course of about 6
hours, so in general changing a source file or two shouldn't take long.
I really didn't want this change, I'm not looking for change just for
the sake of change.  This is something that is being forced upon us by
the increasing availability of ANSI C compilers.

<p>
I think I've gotten everything in LIBFB except the X Windows module
(libfb/if_X.c) ported to IRIX 5 already -- and X is only complaining
about one thing (dpy-&gt;fd reference).  Should be easy to fix.

<p>
	Best,
	 -Mike

<p>
The only reasonable alternative would be to change RGBpixel to be a
structure type, but that means each RGBpixel could have from zero to
five additional unusable "padding" bytes (most likely 1 byte) added
by the compiler, which would (a) waste space and (b) be incompatible
with existing code that handles pixel data as a packed byte array.
Thus, while (a) might be deemed acceptable when designing new software
(especially since it might lead to faster generated code),
consideration (b) pretty much forces the solution Mike chose.

<p>
The "flavor" of code using constructs like pp[i][RED] can be retained
by defining suitable macros, e.g.:

<p>
typedef unsigned char RGBpixel[3];	/* still useful! */
#define RED	0
#define GREEN	1
#define BLUE	2

<p>
#define PIX(a,i,c)	((RGBpixel *)(a))[i][c]
#define	PIX_RED(a,i)	PIX(a,i,RED)
#define	PIX_GREEN(a,i)	PIX(a,i,GREEN)
#define	PIX_BLUE(a,i)	PIX(a,i,BLUE)

<p>
#define PP(i,c)		PIX(pp,i,c)

<p>
	PIX(pp,i,RED)	/* was: pp[i][RED] */
	PIX_RED(pp,i)	/* ditto */
	PP(i,RED)	/* ditto */

Subject:  4.0 on Solaris 2.X (and other porting/misc issues)

<p>
Folks,

<p>
I am in the process of getting 4.0 up and running on Solaris 2.3.  I
have a fair amount of stuff already working and am on the way towards
getting the rest of it working and have a couple of questions that
someone out there might be able to answer.

<p>
I am not on the mailing list so if I am asking questions that have
been discussed before (or discussed to death) please kindly refer me
to the archives (if there are any) and excuse my interruption.

<p>
- The code classifies the world into two interface camps (BSD and
SYSV).  While historically this has been a good way to do things the
days of vanilla BSD versus SYSV are waning.  It looks like most
vendors are going to hybrid systems that support a number of
interfaces.  Are there any plans to try adapt to the brave new hybrid
world any time soon?  I am going to have to butcher the code to make a
number of things work properly and am not looking forward to
perpetrating such bogosity if it can be avoided.

<p>
As an aside, I have worked on a couple of projects where we have taken
the approach of using a single OS define to select a the right set of
interfaces to use on a given platform.  It has been my experience that
this really cuts down on the "ifdef soup" in large projects and makes
it fairly quick and painless to port to a new platform.  It would be
great to see the cad source set up like this although it would require
a boat load of work.

<p>
- Is anyone using shared libraries?  I have not really done any memory
profiling yet but shared libraries usually tend to be a win and do not
require too much extra effort.

<p>
- Is there any tentative release data for the next version yet and is
there a working list of what will be in the next release?

<p>
- Is BRL interested in taking back diffs for solaris support and
integrating them into the next release?

<p>
- When I worked at BRL the platform of choice for running the cad
package was from SGI.  I assume this is still true.  Can someone fill
me in on the config and performance numbers of typical SGI being used
for CAD work?  I would like to put together a similarly configured sun
to see how it performs.

<p>
thanks,
--tim

<p>
PS:  Please make sure to include me, tgsmith@sun.com, directly in any
replies since I am not on the cad mailing list.

Subject: Axes, Automating Repetitive MGED Chores

Thomas Browder writes:
&gt;
&gt;A great aid in MGED would be a constant XYZ coord. system 
&gt;orientation aid, say a small set of labeled unit vectors 
&gt;in the lower right corner of the screen.
&gt;

<p>
Axes are not automatically available in MGED but can easily be built 
as an added element to a .g database.  "The MGED User's Manual", 
Volume IV of the BRL-CAD Release 4.0 Documentation describes building 
coordinate axes in Chapter 13.  Once built, the axes may be included
in any output to aid in orientation and to provide scale.

<p>
Repetitive chores like adding coordinate axes, placing multiple copies
of objects into databases (ex. illustrating burst points around a ground
target), or generating a depiction of a shotline given impact coordinates
and final azimuth/elevation can all be all be automated.  Commands from a
file can be redirected or commands from a program can be piped into MGED
avoiding the repetitious interactive input.

<p>
ex:  #mged test.g &lt;build_test.cmd
 or  #build_test &lt;build.dat | mged test.g

<p>
The creator of the file or the program anticipates the needed MGED command
sequence.  MGED opens the database with null display, echoes the prompts the
user would otherwise see and terminates on EOF.   

<p>
The following shell and awk files provide a quick kludge to automate
the process of adding a single set of coordinate axes to a .g database
where the user specifies an offset (in model coordinates) and axis size
parameters.  The shell script simplifies parameter passing to awk.  The
awk script generates mged commands which can be piped to mged.  Three
cylinders are generated at the specified intersection, defined as regions,
color coded (rgb &lt;==&gt; xyz) and grouped as __axes.  If needed __axes may
be object edited to a better location or they can be removed with
"killtree __axes" and regenerated with more desirable properties.
A sample of the input generated for MGED is also included.

I was trying to duplicate the things in the "Animation Techniques in 
BRL-CAD" WWEB file.  Most everything went fine except when I tried
to preview the animation script in "mged", in which case "mged" just
quit on me when I typed the command "preview moss.rtanim".  This 
happend in both the 4.1 and 4.2 version of BRL-CAD.  Below is the
output from meged:

The "moss.rtanim" script seems fine to me, because it works fine
when I create the Postage stamp animations.  Does any one know why
this is not working? I am running on a 4D/35 with Irix 4.0.5.  

<p>
  I also have a few more questions.  The first is how the mpeg movie
for the animations in this paper were created? Is there some public
domain software which can convert the BRL-CAD pix files into a MPEG
file?  Finally, whay are the main new features of the 4.2 version.  Is
it just a improved X11 version of "mged"?  I could sure use the NURB
editting capability that is being worked on.  Any plans on a beta 
relase of this stuff?

The SURVIAC BRL-CAD User's Group Meeting was held at the Booz-
Allen Hamilton facilities in McLean, Virginia.  Mr. Jeff Foulk, 
SURVIAC Aberdeen Satellite Office (ASO) project manager, welcomed 
the attendees, presented the purpose of the meeting, and provided 
an overview of the SURVIAC organization.  The thrust of the 
meeting was presentation of uses for BRL-CAD, program updates, and 
discussion of user problems and ideas.

<p>
Ms. Carla Moyer, SURVIAC ASO administrative manager, presented the 
function of the SURVIAC ASO regarding BRL-CAD.  SURVIAC full 
support includes distributing the BRL-CAD source code and 
documentation, providing telephone support for installation and 
operation technical inquiries, distributing maintenance release 
updates, and maintaining a mailing list database of users.  Points 
of contact for BRL-CAD 4.0 are:

<p>
          Technical Inquires:        cad@arl.army.mil

<p>
Mr. Bob Strausser, SURVIAC ASO BRL-CAD technical POC, presented an 
overview of technical inquiries over the last 9 months.  Inquiries 
were primarily administrative (67%) with the balance divided 
between installation and operation questions.

<p>
During the Technical Inquiry overview, Dr. Dietz stressed that the 
vdeck conversion program and gift shotlining program are obsolete.  
The principal problem with using vdeck lies with the expansion of 
BRL-CAD primitives beyond the supported primitives of the old 
comgeom format (generated by vdeck).  This can result in the loss 
of data by the conversion back into the comgeom era.  Joseph 
Silverstein is using vdeck and gift to interface between BRL-CAD 
geometries and the schrim radar signature program.  Dr. Deitz and 
Bill Mermagen, Jr. recommended using rtrayhist and xpatch as 
better tools than the gift / schrim pair.  The vdeck and gift 
programs are also used to feed hevart because the sequence of 
shotlines provided by rtg3 is not compatible with hevart's input 
requirements.  Carole Keyser recommended using shotb2g, it 
converts rtg3 output into a format compatible with hevart.  
Contact John Anderson at ARL (278-7267) for copies of the shotb2g 
program.

<p>
Mr. Bob Strausser also presented a status update on the patch-g 
conversion program.  This program provides initial conversion of 
FASTGEN faceted geometry descriptions into BRL-CAD format.  The 
updated program has been sent to Bill Mermagen, Jr. for review and 
release.

<p>
Bill Mermagen, Jr. presented an overview of BRL-CAD status and 
plans.  The next release of BRL-CAD anticipated Summer 1994, will 
have a production version of the N-manifold Geometry (NMG) 
capability.  This will permit use of polygonal representations for 
import, export, and visualization and will provide better support 
for faceted-geometry dependent analysis codes.  Along with the 
NMGs, new primitives (i.e.. elliptical tori, paraboloids, and 
hyperboloids) will be available.  A second task area has been 
revising the MGED graphical user interface (GUI) to make the 
system more user friendly.  Two GUIs are in development as 
replacements for the current interface.  One GUI (being developed 
by Phil Dykstra) is based on MOTIFF and X-windows.  The other GUI 
(being developed by Mike Muuss) is 
vendor independent (depart from X-window dependency).  The BRL-CAD 
team (primarily Mike Muuss) is also examining the possibility of 
using virtual reality.  The third task area has provided more 
conversion routines for importing foreign CAD geometries into BRL-
CAD.

<p>
The importance of BRL-CAD's need to support faceted geometries 
(the NMG / tessellation upgrade)  was reinforced by Kellye Frew , 
Applied Research Associates (ARA).  She indicated that ARA is 
involved with an effort to generate a 3-D mesh to interface with 
epic.  BRL-CAD was used for Phase I of this program.

<p>
Mr. Bud Bruenning, Sverdrup Technology, presented an overview of 
how he is using BRL-CAD and enhancements he would like to see.  
The highest priority was a simple tutorial document.  He would 
also like some new image generation capabilities (cross sectional 
cuts, automated component id number labeling, easier overlays).  
Lesser issues concerned improvements to patch-g and better support 
from the developers.  Dr. Dietz suggested that Bud visit with ARL 
for a "working group" session on generating images and plots.  Any 
one interested in participating in an imaging working group, 
please contact the SURVIAC ASO (Resalee Bilka).

<p>
Geometric Solutions, Inc. (GSI) presented a report on the addition 
of joint information to BRL-CAD models.  This new ability, as 
outlined by Chris Johnson, GSI, will allow users to change the 
configuration of targets with a simple click and drag interface.

<p>
This new capability is being integrated with BRL-CAD and will be 
available to all in the next BRL-CAD release.  More information is 
available from Victor Cericole, Jr., GSI Software Director, 1-800-
598-BRLCAD (2752).

<p>
Mr. Steve McKay, Pacific-Sierra Research Corp., expressed an 
interest in accessing a model description database.  He is aware 
of several and was wondering if any coordination existed between 
these databases.  Information concerning geometry model databases 
would be appreciated as the SURVIAC ASO researches this issue.

Subject:  Re: rt_free( rt_i ) ???
Message-ID:  &lt;9312220707.aa28241@WOLF.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>

<p>
&gt; BTW, I had been using rt_malloc, [...]

<p>
Good, I'm glad it has been useful.

<p>
&gt; Now, I have another question.  The interactive program I am developing
&gt; may import many different BRL-CAD data bases during a single session.
&gt; Each may optionally be raytraced any number of times.  When I am done
&gt; each raytrace, I am finished with the struct rt_i that rt_dirbuild
&gt; gave me.  Is there a (kosher) way to free the memory allocated for this
&gt; rt_i and its members?

<p>
The answer is: YES.  I already thought of that. :-)  It's broken out
in several pieces, so you can free different parts at different times.

<p>
	/* Release dynamic storage */
	rt_vlist_cleanup();		/* if you use vlist */

<p>
	rt_clean( rtip );		/* eliminate prepping, but not db */
	db_close( rtip-&gt;rti_dbip );	/* eliminate all db info */

<p>
#if MEMORY_LEAK_CHECKING
	rt_prmem("After complete processing");
#endif

<p>
I noticed that there was no way to dispose of the rt_i structure itself,
so I've added:

<p>
	rt_free_rti( rtip );		/* does rt_clean, db_close, rt_free */

<p>
Also note that if you are not changing the database, and not doing any
articulations, you can just keep using the existing rt_i structure.
No need to re-prep.

<p>
If you are doing articulations, you can rt_clean(), change articulation,
and then just call rt_gettrees() and rt_prep().

<p>
If you are going to be changing databases in mid-stream, there is
probably some additional minor library support that you will need.
(Such as routines like rt_new_rti(), and perhaps reference counts
on the db_i structures).  I have always intended for this to be
possible, but I've never actually tried it, so you know what that means.
Please let me know what you have in mind, so we can support it.

<p>
&gt; I'm already peeking (poking) at struct region
&gt; to put criticality information in the reg_udata member.  Is that even
&gt; kosher?

<p>
reg_mfuncs and reg_udata are pointers for you to set as you need.
It's entirely kosher for you to make them point at your own data
structures.  (Just don't serve them on the same plates as the Swiss
cheese.)

<p>
&gt; Maybe I should make a (short) list of the rules I am breaking
&gt; (especially w.r.t. union record) and see if you guys can come up with
&gt; an alternative for me (either a better way for me to do it, or new
&gt; library calls to be maintained outside of application code.)

<p>
That sounds like a very good idea.  If there is some operation that you
need to be able to do to the data structures, probably somebody else
will have a similar need in the future.  So it would be best to minimize
special LIBRT interface code built into your application.   Unless it
turns out to be really hard, I'd rather just make sure that the library
gives you all the support that you need.  So speak up. :-)

<p>
So, now I'm curious:  what are you doing to "union record"?  That
structure defines the on-disk database format, and is _the_ most
difficult to change....  Hopefully you meant "union region"?

<p>
	Best,
	 -Mike

Subject:  BRL-CAD as Interim PDES/STEP standard
Message-ID:  &lt;9401251925.aa04336@WORM.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>
To mdelapp,

<p>
BRL-CAD has been proposed as an AMC standard for geometric system data
exchange through the AMC Functional Coordinating Group for Computer
Interoperability and Interchange (FCG-CII).  PDES/STEP are ultimately tackling
a much broader spectrum of data, such as plumbing and sheet-metal-folding
data, than what BRL-CAD represents.  BRL-CAD however offers an OPEN (i.e.
government owned) format for exchange of geometric information and
associated properties at a level of information sufficient for most of the
engineering analyses performed within AMC.  No commercial CAD/CAE package can
meet all the requirements for geometry representation/interrogation to meet
the analysis needs of this community - hence the proliferation of different
CAD/CAE systems.

<p>
BACKGROUND.  The issue of geometric target data exchange came up between ARL
(old BRL), ARDEC, Benet and TACOM when it was pointed out that each
organization used a different modeling system.  For efficient design,
evaluation and integration of Army systems it would be of benefit if these
organizations could exchange system information in electronic format.
MICOM also asked to be included on the Technical Working Group to address
these issues, since within MICOM they had as many or more
different/non-compatible modeling systems as the rest of us put together.
Most of the commercial modeling systems have proprietary data
representations and although you can build geometric target descriptions in
these modelers and perform various analyses, most do not allow you to export
the geometry and associated information such as material properties.
Additionally, the underlying mathematical representations of the data, if
available, may not be compatible. That is, a format for exchange does not
handle translation of data from one mathematical form to another.  

<p>

<p>
CURRENT STATUS. PDES/STEP addresses only the problem of exchange, not
translation.  That is, if two modeling systems represent the geometric
information in the same mathematical form - say splines, then PDES/STEP
specifies the format for exchange. However, the PDES/STEP standardization
effort is still fairly young and not all geometric entities are yet
specified for exchange. For example, in the area of solids, there is no
specification for the exchange of a truncated general cone, elliptical torus,
paraboloid of one sheet, etc.

<p>
Within AMC we have both problems, that is, the underlying mathematical
representations of the geometry are not the same and not all geometric
representations are covered by exchange specifications.  BRL-CAD, used by
ARL, is a Constructive Solid Geometric modeling system with Boolean trees.
Intergraph, used by TACOM, is believed to be a spline-based system, although
the specific data representations are proprietary.  Translators, which may
be approximations, must be developed to transfer data between these systems.

<p>

<p>
TRANSLATORS

<p>
BRL-CAD &lt;=&gt; Intergraph.  The Foreign Science and Technology Center and the
Tank Automotive Command jointly sponsored BRL-CAD &lt;=&gt; Intergraph translators
through a contract with Intergraph. The Intergraph =&gt; BRL-CAD translation is
accomplished by converting GIFT (Geometric Information For Targets) and
Booleans into the corresponding BRL-CAD representations.  Any solid not
represented in the GIFT format is tessellated and transferred as a
polysolid.  The Intergraph =&gt; BRL-CAD translator works reasonably well,
when Intergraph models have been constructed following certain stylistic
rules peculiar to the translator, however the BRL-CAD=&gt; Intergraph
translator has a much greater loss of information.  

<p>
PATCH-G.  The patch-g translator was developed by BRL (now ARL) under
sponsorship by the Air Force.  Patch-g translates FASTGEN2/FASTGEN3 target
descriptions into BRL-CAD .g format.  Plate-mode facets are difficult to
convert. 

<p>
Jack-G.  Jack is an articulated human figure package developed by the
University of Pennsylvania under the sponsorship of the Human Engineering
Laboratory (now Human Research & Engineering Directorate, Army Research
Laboratory).  ARL/SLAD developed the jack-g translator to import articulated
human figures into vehicles.

<p>
ACAD &lt;=&gt; BRL-CAD.  ACAD is the geometric modeling system developed by
General Dynamics in the Fort Worth office (this branch has since been sold
to one of the aircraft companies). ACAD has developed and distributes the
ACAD &lt;=&gt; BRL-CAD translators.  ARL has no experience with the use of these
translators.

<p>
BRL-CAD &lt;=&gt; Euclid.  Euclid is a geometric modeling system developed by
Matra Datavision of France.  The underlying data representation is believed
to be cubic Bezier patches (the simplest subset of B-splines), however,
the users with whom we are coordinating the effort, have access to only a
polygonal boundary representation of their geometry. ARL is currently
extending our valid data representations to include N-Manifold Geometry
(NMG) data structures.  In the initial implementation, NMGs will include
polygonal boundary representations and the associated topological
information.  We are currently able to import Euclid polygons into BRL-CAD
and view them using the polygon fill hardware of the SGI, but cannot
interrogate (i.e., raytrace) the geometry.  Conversion routines for CSG to
NMG forms must be completed to export BRL-CAD to Euclid.

<p>
BRL-CAD &lt;=&gt; IGES.  The IGES=&gt; BRL-CAD converter has been developed in-house
(by ARL) and has recently been upgraded to include the IGES BREP (boundary
representation) objects into N-Manifold Geometry (NMG) data structures for
planar faces and IGES drawings (2D lines) to BRL-CAD NMG's.  The iges-g
converter translates IGES Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) files into
BRL-CAD CSG files with approximations for IGES solids of revolution and
solids of linear extrusion.  The g-iges translator allows for two types of
IGES output from BRL-CAD.  1) A 100% facetized representation can be
selected where each region is facetized to an NMG object before output as an
IGES "Manifold Solid BREP Object (MSBO)", or 2) a mostly CSG file can be
produced where each region is output as an IGES "Boolean Tree" entity and
each solid is output as the corresponding IGES solid.  In cases where there
is no corresponding IGES solid (truncated general cone, elliptical torus,
etc.), a facetized approximation of the BRL-CAD solid is output as an IGES
MSBO.  The efforts described here depend on the current NMG work mentioned
in the previous paragraph.  We expect the NMG work and translators to be
available in the next BRL-CAD release.

<p>
Target descriptions in BRL-CAD format are a deliverable from the contractor
on most ground system development programs.  Since the BRL-CAD format
is government developed and open, it can be specified as a deliverable in a
contract.  This facilitates the transfer to Intergraph for analyses by TACOM
and directly feeds the vulnerability/lethality analyses required by ARL.

<p>
The Intelligence Community Modeling Group is also relying on BRL-CAD
geometry both as input to various signature codes (e.g. Xpatch, TSAR) and
also as an intermediate file format for exchange.  We are currently
investigating extending our geometry representations to include a "height
field" data type to facilitate terrain modeling in support of a DMSO
proposal for signature generation and automatic target recognition.  

<p>
I have included below a note from one of our users who uses BRL-CAD
specifically as an interface between other CAD tools.

<p>
At Mcdonnell Douglas, we are using BRL-CAD as an interface between other CAD 
tools (such as Unigraphics, PATRAN, and SMART) and radiation transport codes to 
calculate the radiation dose in space (e.g., from solar flare protons or cosmic 
ray heavy ions).  The ray tracing capabilities of BRL-CAD are what led us to 
this configuration.  As we gain experience with the package, we may use it as 
more of a total integrated product development tool (e.g., for determining mass 
properties, etc.).  So far, we are very pleased with tho package.

<p>
Future uses for the radiation transport work include medical imaging and 
therapy, and risk calculations for the High-Speed Civil Transport.

I was trying to figure out how to use the pipe generating code, by
playing around with pipetest.c, but it seems like all the pipes are
generated with a infinitly small diameter.  Even, if I try to change
the id and od parameters.  The pipes that are generated by the program
cannot be zoomed in on.  How do I increase the diameters of the pipes?
I tried using the following for:
        {
                {(long)WDB_PIPESEG_MAGIC, 0, 0},
                0, 1, 0,
                0, 0, 0,
                500.10, 900.5, WDB_PIPESEG_TYPE_LINEAR
        },
From my understanding this should give an id=500.10 mm and an od=900.5,
but I still cannot zoom in on the resulting pipe.  

<p>
Also, how does one specify bends greater than 90 degrees (like say
180 degreees)?

<p>
The old Television saying applies here: "The Problem is Not in Your Set".

<p>
The support for PIPE solids is very rudimentary.  What you see was done
as part of the proposal for a joint project with Air Systems Branch that
was not funded.   The data structures are defined, and the import/export
routines exist, but the PIPEs can not be ray-traced.  They can't really
be edited in MGED either, and when drawn, only the centerline is
displayed.

<p>
So, what you are seeing is not that the diameter is not being stored in
the database, but instead that the drawing routine is not drawing the
exterior of the pipes.

<p>
It is unlikely that anyone in ARL will be fleshing out the PIPE solid,
at least not within this FY. If you wish to complete the code yourself,
the changes are restricted to one file:  librt/g_pipe.c.  In the
alternative, you might be able to use cylingders and spheres, as is
often done now.

Subject:  Irix 5 GL // LIBFB bug
Message-ID:  &lt;9401282248.aa19808@WOLF.BRL.MIL&gt;

<p>

<p>
Those of you with Silicon Graphics machines running recent versions
of the operating system (Irix 5) have probably noticed how programs
linked with -lgl (most notably all the BRL-CAD programs that use LIBFB)
won't work unless $DISPLAY is pointing to a GL-capable workstation.

<p>
Well, in the release notes for Irix 5.2, they make mention of this:

<p>
      You can work around this in one of two easy ways:

<p>
              1.  Set your DISPLAY environment variable to a GL-
                  capable system.

<p>
              2.  Set an environment variable called
                  __SGI_NO_REMOTE_GL before executing the program.
                  This prevents you from rendering remotely should
                  you try to do so. The DISPLAY environment
                  variable is always interpreted as rendering to
                  local host.

<p>
I've added a reminder to my .login file:

<p>
# SGI Irix 5 bug workaround
# setenv __SGI_NO_REMOTE_GL 1

<p>
This isn't something to set all the time, because there are occasions
when using remote GL windows *is* what you intend to do.

<p>

This occurs when you run across the network--running edpix on another machine
using your workstation as the window server.  It wasn't designed to do this
and couldn't under Irix 3.3.  Now, Irix 4+ permits this using X, but it is far
from a smooth interface.  I recommend only running on your local workstation.

For test purposes, I did an "edpix" run consisting only of
"edpix -f filename.pix" and then immediately exiting.  What
would cause a slew of messages "dgl error (pup): too many callbacks"
to appear?  (I noticed those messages after leaving edpix.)
Would you like to look at the file with that problem?  It seems to
behave normally otherwise.  Let me know and I can supply a path to

Dear John,

<p>
	The target description in question contains 16,000 solids, regions, and
groups.  We can reduce this amount if we remove the slotted screws holding
down the cupolas and reducing the number of solids per link well below 39.

<p>
	Please note that the description is only an exterior description.
Adding the interior will probably increase it by another 12,000.  Thanks.

<p>
	By the way, the target contains battle damage such as dents, third
country effects (non-standard detail items), and test repair items such as
surrogate storage boxes.

<p>

We are looking for images and geometry showing dual-use technology
with BRL-CAD. Dual Use Technology is technology that is of use to the
Defense Department and to other organizations for non-defense
applications. We are looking for BRL-CAD images and or geometry that
show a non-defense application in any one of these areas:

<p>
	    Computer Aided Design (CAD)
	    Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM)
	    Animation
	    Visualization
	    Image Processing
	    Graphic Arts
	    Architectural Design
	    Education
	    Medical Technology
	    Other (please elaborate)

<p>
All of the images and or geometry will be properly credited, and will
not be distributed or displayed the to the general public unless you
state otherwise. We will use these to help defend our budget and to show
how BRL-CAD is being used by a large and diverse community. We may also
want to use them for a brochure announcing a future BRL-CAD users
conference (Spring of 1995). If you have further questions, or would
like to contribute, please send me e-mail (stay@arl.army.mil).  I can
take images and or geometry from the network, or you can send them to me
via regular postal mail. Let me know and we can work out the details.

<p>
Thanks,

<p>

<p>
p.s. I am unable to compensate any organization or individuals for
images and or geometry that are sent.

<p>
p.s.s. Don't send mail asking me about the future conference, since
the only thing we currently know is that it will be sometime in the
spring of 1995.

Subject: Missing makekey on non-US Sun Solaris

<p>
 
Previously I asked for assistance to unpack the BRL distribution using
Solaris 2.3, as makekey is missing.
 
I have checked things with Sun Sweden. Makekey is only included in the Solaris
Encryption kit which is not exported from the USA.
 
I solved the problem as follows:
 
Insert SunOS 4.1.1 CD
ln -s /cdrom/cdrom0/s0/export/exec/sun4_sunos_4_1_1/usr ~/brl-dir
cd ~/brl-dir
tar xvf usr ./lib/makekey
 
Further enigma.c need to be modified to use a local makekey by changing one of
the paths to ./makekey.

&gt; what I tried to do is to build a simple object in auto-cad out of 
&gt; primitive solids for instance a box and a cone, translate them to
&gt; IGES format (my autocad supports IGES 4.0) and then by using the 
&gt; iges-g module translate the IGES file to brl-cad format.
&gt; everything seemed to be going fine until I applied iges-g.
&gt; The routine started working by counting the number of lines in the 
&gt; objects but when it reached the part where it counts the number of
&gt;  solids/regions it counted 0 (zero).

<p>
	While IGES 4.0 supports solid models, what Autocad produced
for you was an IGES "drawing" of the object you built, not a solid
model. The key is that iges-g says it found no solids or regions in
the IGES file. BRLCAD is a solid modeller, so it needs solid objects
to operate on. The iges-g converter distributed with BRLCAD converts
only IGES CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) objects to BRLCAD format.
Converting a drawing of a solid object (as Autocad provided) to a real
solid model of that object is something people have been dreaming of for
years, but so far it takes human intelligence in the loop.  If Autocad
would support the IGES CSG portion of IGES 4.0, then the conversion
you attempted would work.

<p>
&gt; can someone please give an answer to the problem :what  kind (if
&gt; any) of objects made in autocad can be translated via IGES files to brlcad
&gt;  and  HOW CAN I DO IT?

<p>
	As I mentioned above, if there is a version of Autcad that will
produce IGES 4.0 CSG files, then you can convert them to BRLCAD. One
other possibility is if Autocad can produce IGES 128 entities (NURBS),
the iges-g converter will convert these entities to BRLCAD spline solids
by combining all the 128's in the IGES file into a single spline solid.
Note that this will not work for trimmed NURBS yet.

<p>
	The next release of BRLCAD will include an improved iges-g converter
that will also handle IGES BREP (Boundary Representation) solid models
(restricted to planar-faced objects).  There will also be a "dxf-g" to
convert Autocad's DXF format to BRLCAD, however this will also be limited
to 3D objects (3DFACES and 3DMESH objects) and 2D drawing entities will
be ignored.

		A New Command-Line Option Parser for BRL-CAD

<p>
				ACST Team Meeting
				   18-Feb-1994

<p>

<p>
	--- GOALS ---

<p>
*)  Backwards compatability with current getopt() style command usage,
so that e.g. "pix-fb -hizs32" is understood as a series of 1-char options.

<p>
*)  Opportunity for more options than with present getopt(), e.g. long
option names a.la. X-windows (including abbreviated forms), while also
retaining 1-char options.

<p>
*)  Each 1-char option should have the opportunity for a long option
that does exactly the same thing.

<p>
*)  Eliminate redundancy.  One table should suffice for usage message,
arg/no-arg flagging ("g:"), verbose help message.  It would be nice
to also eliminate the getopt() style switch() statement, perhaps by
including pointers to the variable to be set and/or by having a hooked
function pointer in the table.

<p>
*)  It would be nice to (a) check for proper number of positional
arguments, and (b) perhaps parse them into variables as well.

<p>
*)  It would be nice to have "supplemental text" to supplement the
usage message with, tucked into the same table.  (Perhaps as part of
the NULL entry at the end?)

<p>
*)  It would be nice to have a routine that could print out (or perhaps
return a string with) a command-line which completely represented the
state of the program's options, including showing the values for all
options that were defaulted.

<p>
	--- ISSUES ---

<p>
*)  How to mix long and short forms?  One proposal is to have all
long forms start with a double-minus, e.g.:

<p>
	pix-fb --width 32 -s128 --inverse foo.pix

<p>
This is not incompatible with the getopt() usage of "--" to mark end of
option list, but it is a nuisance to type two minus signs.

<p>
*)  How to determine the minimum acceptable abbreviation for long option
names.  The X strategy of taking the shortest unique substring is
convenient for the programmer, but means that adding new options may
break old shell scripts, e.g. -geometry abbreviated as -geo in a script
would no longer work when a -geodesic flag was added.  The VMS style
alternative would require the programmer to designate the minimum
acceptable substring, which seems preferable.  For example, either
"-geom*etry", or "-GEOMetry" could both be used.

<p>
*)  Long argument names should be case insensitive.  Shouldn't they?

The following message should allow you to fix the malloc error in the iges-g

<p>
&gt; My problem now is: What and or where are &lt;bsd/sys/types.h&gt; and
&gt; &lt;bsd/sys/time.h&gt;? (Required in fbed/empty.c)

<p>
The use of &lt;bsd/sys/whatever&gt; in fbed/empty.c was to get to the BSD-
flavored stuff under older IRIX releases (probably IRIX 3.x).  Under
IRIX 4.x the BSD stuff was apparently integrated into /usr/include,
so you just want to use &lt;sys/types.h&gt; and &lt;sys/time.h&gt;, but the
/usr/include/bsd directory was still there for backward compatibility.
This compatibility was apparently removed in IRIX 5, so no /usr/
include/bsd anymore.

<p>
In your case, I would just change the CPP directives at the top of
empty.c to always include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; and &lt;sys/time.h&gt;.  I'm not
sure what the politically-correct solution is for the official
BRL-CAD copy.  For instance, making rash statements like, if someone
is still running IRIX 3 or earlier, they probably [...various things
could go in here...], may not be acceptible policy. ;^)

<p>
&gt; This is a follow up question to my last letter concerning conversion from
&gt; AUTOCAD to BRLCAD. I have been talking to some CAD people and for
&gt; some reason they keep on telling me that even if you have a CAD package
&gt; that works with solids, when you convert a solid to IGES format, the solid
&gt; is broken into wire frame which doesn't keep the solid properties. I am quite
&gt; confused now, since I was told last time that IGES does support solid entities?
&gt; could someone enlighten me?

<p>
	The IGES specification includes support for both CSG and BREP
solid models.  It is up to the CAD vendor to decide how much of the IGES
spec they are willing to support.  Users of solid modelling CAD systems should
let their vendors know that they expect to be able to exchange solid models
via IGES without rebuilding the model from wireframe or just a collection
of surfaces in space.

<p>
&gt; also if ,as I understand importation of solids via IGES is possible,does 
&gt; any one Know if it is possible to do it from UCLID,UNIGRAPHICS or CATIA?
&gt; and if it's possible than how?

<p>
	The current BRL-CAD distribution include an "iges-g" that will import
IGES CSG solids into the BRL-CAD format.  This means IGES files that contain
entities such as cones, cylinders, blocks, wedges, etc, along with the CSG
specific entities such as Boolean trees, solid assemblies, and solid instances.

<p>
	The next release of BRL-CAD will include an improved "iges-g" that will
also handle IGES BREP files of a limited variety. These files must contain IGES
FACE, EDGE, LOOP, and VERTEX entities (the first release of this converter
will be limited to planar faces).

<p>
&gt; Iam asking this in order to save me a few months work of rebuilding a vehicle
&gt; built in UCLID.

<p>

<p>
	The next release of BRL-CAD will also include a EUCLID-G converter that
converts what EUCLID calls a "decoded" file into the BRL-CAD format. This decoded file
contains an ASCII representation of a facetted approximation of the solid model.

<p>
	Neither of these converters are available until the next release. Both will
be producing a variety of NMG objects that are not supported in the current release.

	As Gomer would say "Surprise, Surprise, Surprise!!!". The BRL-CAD

will allow BRL-CAD users to create BREP objects. Initially, we will be limited

Trimmed-NURB faces.  The next release is expected to include planar-face NMG's.

There is currently no way to change the background in MGED to anything

color for an object is full-brightness red, which should be easy to see.

Something else may be going wrong.

<p>
What kind of SGI, running what version of the operating system?
What release of BRL-CAD are you running?  4.2?  (MGED prints this
as it's first message).

Subject:  Re: Ray-trace intensity
Message-ID:  &lt;9407212150.aa18012@wolf.arl.mil&gt;

<p>

<p>
&gt; We are creating models of gamma camera collimators in MGED:

<p>
Sounds pretty cool!

<p>
&gt; This seems to work well for point sources, but when we tried to go to
&gt; more complicated light sources, we discovered that the intensity of the
&gt; shadow cast by the collimator dropped dramatically as the source size
&gt; increased.

<p>
This is a general problem with modeling area light sources when
ray-tracing. The general strategy that I implemented in RT is to
represent the light region as a cube (described simply by the radius of
the inscribed sphere).  When firing light visibility rays, the aim
point is perturbed off the centroid of the light region by drawing
three random numbers and perturbing the X Y and Z components of the
aim point separately.  This is sometimes called "dithering the light
visibility ray aim points".

<p>
Sampling area lights with only one ray per pixel tends to produce very
poor (noisy) results in the penumbra areas.  And, you guessed it....

<p>
&gt; Is there a way to increase the number of rays used by rt?

<p>
Yes.  Use the -H# command line option, to "hypersample".  The positive
integer argument ("#") indicates how many _additional_ rays to fire
for each pixel.  Note that this automaticly causes "-J1" to be set,
to cause the start point of the rays to be dithered (which is an
entirely different matter from dithering the light aim points).

<p>
-H causes a simple average of the collected samples to be stored for
each pixel.  This is not the best strategy, but is useful when output
file size is an issue.  (More below).

<p>
How many extra rays will be needed depends on how much noise you are
willing to tolerate, and how large your light source is.  The larger
the light source, the more rays you will probably need to get a "good"
penumbra.

<p>
Typical values for -H range from -H3 to -H15.  Note that this also
results in a linear increase in runtime.  If the runtime for -H0 is X,
then the runtime for -Hnnn is (nnn+1)*X.

<p>
A more satisfying solution is to increase the resolution of the pixel
grid appropriately, and then set -H0 and -J1.  This stores one ray per
pixel, but with full dithering enabled.  After the image has been
written, low pass filter the result and decimate.  One cheap, dirty,
and fast program for doing this is PIXHALVE, which uses a simple 5x5
filter pyramid, and reduces image size by half in both dimensions.

<p>
More sophisticated filter techniques can also be implemented.

<p>
If disk space for the (perhaps 4x or 16x larger) initial .pix file is
not a problem, this strategy gives much better results than the
comparable -H3 or -H15 approach, at identical runtime.  (Not counting
the one or two passes of PIXHALVE, which doesn't add much).

<p>
Why not experiment with -H and/or the filter & decimate strategies,
and see if that meets your needs.

<p>
I'd love to see an image of one of your collimators sometime.  Sounds
like a fascinating application!

<p>

&gt; Here at TI we do a lot of modelling with Pro/Engineer.  I would be very
&gt; interested in hearing how you convert those models into BRL-CAD, and the
&gt; code that allows you to do that.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.

<p>

<p>
	There are actually two codes invloved in conversion from Pro/Engineer
to BRL-CAD.  The first is a Pro/Develop code.  This code uses the Pro/Develop
library that you only get with the Pro/Develop option of Pro/E.  The
resulting executable, however, may be used by other Pro/E sites without
a Pro/Develop license. This code installs an additional menu item (labelled
"BRL-CAD") under Pro/E's "export" menu. Selecting this menu option activates
the code. It then traverses the current object in the Pro/E session and
writes assembly information (member names and transformation matrices) to
an ascii file. Assemblies and sub-assemblies are handled this way. Parts
(the actual solids in a Pro/E model) are output to the same ascii file in
render format using the same routine that Pro/E uses to output objects
in render format (render format is a variety of triangulated facets). One
might ask, "Why not just use Pro/E's render export option?". This was my
first idea also, but as it is implimented in Pro/E, the entire model is
exported as a single solid made up of lots of triangular facets. I wanted
to get the individual parts as seperate objects and the assemblies as
groupings of these objects.

<p>
	The second code converts this ascii file to the BRL-CAD format.
It reads the assembly information and creates BRL-CAD groups. The parts
(solids) are converted to BRL-CAD NMG or polysolid objects according to
a command line option.  A region is constructed for each part and any
color assigned to the part in Pro/E is assigned to the region.

<p>
	Note that the resulting BRL-CAD objects are facetted approximations
of the actual Pro/E model. The quality of the approximation can be controlled
on a scale from 1 to 10, where a quality of 1 may approximate a cylinder as
a rectangular parallelepiped and a quality of 10 might break the cylinder
surface into 20 rectangular facets. It's not that simple as the Pro/E
routine actually uses a combination of chord height (distance from actual
surface to facet approximation) and an angle control that provides additional
improvement along curves with small radii.

<p>
	 Other properties that are used in a BRL-CAD region or group (such
as ident number, los, material code, etc) could be set as user parameters
in Pro/E and detected and assigned to the BRL-CAD group or region. This
has not yet been implimented, and would require a list of user parameter
names to be agreed upon.

<p>
	Hope this answers your question.

<p>

Subject: Re:Suggestion for LIBRT

<p>

<p>

<p>
&gt;&gt; The thing which inspired this:  I was playing around today with sh_marble.c,
&gt;&gt; trying to create a link in a chain out of a couple of tori and cylinders,
&gt;&gt; and noticed that a change in region caused the turbulence to change.
&gt;
&gt;As an alternative, perhaps the origin of the texture could optionally be
&gt;anchored to a point in space.  Either specified numerically, or
&gt;symbolically, something like a/b/crod.r/foo.cyl[TIP].
&gt;
&gt;That would seem like a more direct method of achieving the control sought.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; My proposed suggestion:  For the next release of BRL-CAD, could you please
&gt;&gt; add a field to "struct region" in raytrace.h which points to the directory
&gt;&gt; entry from which the region was created, [...]
&gt;
&gt;It's encoded in the reg_name, in an inconvient format. Perhaps instead
&gt;of storing the name, the db_full_path info should be kept instead.  Takes
&gt;about the same amount of space either way.  An rt_vls_??? routine to
&gt;format the db_full_path info into a VLS string would be the only thing
&gt;needed to make the interface clean.
&gt;
&gt;	Thoughts?
&gt;

<p>
After posting my suggestion, I developed a workaround that basically
does the same thing.  In the case of sh_marble, it involves adding an
"identification" integer to marble_specific, in order to group marble
regions by some arbitrary, MATPARM-specified value.  IE,

<p>
	struct marble_specific {
		struct marble_specific  *forw;
		int                     ident;
		...
	};

<p>
	static struct marble_specific *Marble_Chain;

<p>
and

<p>
	struct structparse marble_parse[] ={
		{"%d",  1, "id", MARB_O(ident), FUNC_NULL },
		...
	};

<p>
When the regions are being set up, the Ident field is inspected to see
if a non-zero value was returned by rt_structparse().  If so, it is
added to a singly-linked list headed by "Marble_Chain".  The list is
then scanned to find all regions which match the Ident, and VMIN/VMAX is
called against all of them to find a bounding RPP which encloses all
regions of note.  Once the scan is completed, the results of VMIN/VMAX
are then propogated to all matching regions.  This can obviously be
improved, but it presently gets the job done.

<p>
An example of this has been uploaded to wolf:/incoming/link.pix.Z.  "Link"
is a 512x512 raytraced image of a link out of a chain, using the modified
marble shader to produce the body color and an experimental dielectric
shader to do shadowing (although the specular reflection did get overexposed
in order to better contrast the turbulence).  With the exception of the
upper right joint, the results are nice and smooth.

<p>
From a modelling perspective, this approach wins hands down over changing
LIBRT, because it allows the modeller to explicitly tell the shader which
*combinations*, taken together, are "cut from the same stone." 

<p>
Finally, I can see where this approach would be useful in rendering
sculpted CSG glass by allowing you to explicitly declare which regions are
of the same composite material, so that refract.c doesn't have to guess
which regions are continuations of one another.  An example of what I
am referring to are the "Hurricane Lamps" on page 24 of the April 1994
issue of Computer Graphics World, and the seams which show up at the top
of the lamps where the tori joins the body but not elsewhere.

Subject:  RT timing on IRIX 5
Message-ID:  &lt;9408221626.aa21854@wolf.arl.mil&gt;

<p>

<p>
I fixed a bug in rt_get_timer()/rt_read_timer() that was resulting in
improper performance measurements of runtime on SGI systems.

<p>
I upgraded rt/do.c to use rt_get_timer() in place of rt_read_timer()
so that I could get wallclock as well as CPU time.  And then upgraded
the RT statistics output to display the statistics in *all* the
different ways that are commonly interesting:

<p>
Frame     0:    65536 pixels in       3.04 sec =   21551.98 pixels/sec
Frame     0:    76479 rays   in       3.04 sec =   25150.67 rays/sec (RTFM)
Frame     0:    76479 rays   in      12.16 sec =    6287.67 rays/CPU_sec
Frame     0:    76479 rays   in       3.17 sec =   24157.05 rays/sec (wallclock)

<p>
The first two are conventional (and now are correct!), while the second
two are new.

<p>
The "rays/sec" figure is a measure of the performance of the SYSTEM
(presumably "all" CPUs running), while the "rays/CPU_sec" figure is a
measure of the efficiency of the system.  "rays/sec (wallclock)", on an
unloaded system, is an indicator of actual results, and takes into
account I/O speeds, paging, OS overhead, etc.

<p>
One of the most important bugs pending for this release has now been
fixed! Onward to the rest of them.

<p>

Robert,

<p>
You are running into problems with changes in the IRIX operating system.  The 
errata are for the IRIX 4.0.5 operating system but you are using IRIX 5.2.

<p>
The Cakefile.defs need to be edited for the current BRL-CAD release to 
compile on IRIX 5.2.  The following comments were extracted / edited from 
email traffic concerning the install:

<p>
If you set the SGI_CC environment to -cckr This should fix your problems.

<p>
setenv SGI_CC -cckr

<p>
Also take a look at the Cakefile.defs and see the new CFLAGS definitions 
(Irix 5.2 uses the R4000; in the Cakefile.defs the following under 
machinetype 5d is found)

<p>
/*      For R4000 machines you might want to include -KPIC -kpicopt -mips2 on the next line */
/*      instead of -G 15 */
#       define  GFLAG           -KPIC -kpicot -mips2
/*#     define  GFLAG           -G 15  */
/*      ANSI+POSIX mode is used over ANSI, to get fdopen(), etc, defined. */

<p>
It has come to my attention THROUGH A COLLEAGUE'S PROBLEM that using a
long file name in mged's "idents" command is causing a strange failure
(unexplained "sh" message and the idents file getting only the first
half of its normal output).  So I got a test case which I am including
twice in this message (for the sake of readability, the second one has
capital letter X replacing the word "supercalifragilisticexpialidocioius").
The colleague got the problem when he used a full directory path in the
filename argument.

<p>
Here is the original display of my test case:

<p>
mged&gt; idents supercalifragilisticexpialidocioussupercalifragilisticexpialidocious compartment
Summary written in: supercalifragilisticexpialidocioussupercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Processed 1614 Regions
sh: isticexpialidocioussupercalifragilisticexpialidocioussupercalifragilisticexpialidocious: not found
mged&gt;

<p>
Here is the display with X edited in place of the long word:

<p>
mged&gt; idents XX compartment
Summary written in: XX
Processed 1614 Regions
sh: isticexpialidociousXX: not found
mged&gt;

<p>
If the command is going to fail because of a long file name, please make
sure it fails in a sensible way.  Thanks.

<p>

<p>
I have tracked this down to some ancient string handling code in
mged/utility1.c which was using small pre-allocated arrays to hold the
file name.  (Does the number 80 characters ring any bells for people?)

<p>
I replaced the code with new code using rt_vls (variable length string)
calls, and it works fine now.  I also had mged print out the Shell
commands it was running, so you could see what it was up to.

The fix will be available in the Alpha release, Real Soon Now.

<p>
Libfb implements a Direct Color model (since back when real frame buffers
were all 24-bit + colormaps and X didn't exist yet).  So to do full
libfb semantics on a True Color display you need to do software color
mapping.  The SGI X servers provide both True Color and Direct Color
(though we don't use X for 24-bit color on the SGI's).  I don't know
how many other servers provide Direct Color.

<p>
Are there any plans to fix/replace/significantly change libfb or
if_X.c in TNR?

<p>
I am halfway through implementing 24 bit support and would rather not
put much more effort into this if I am only going to have to redo
things for TNR.  I have things working well enough that I can now
squirt 24 bit pix files to the screen which is all I need to get done
for a demo on Wednesday.

<p>
I am currently going through all of the routines adding a switch to
handle the 24, 8, and 1 bit code paths but don't know if I will finish
it.

<p>
I only have True Color 24 bits framebuffers so I don't have to worry
about 24 bit color maps.  How common are Direct Color framebuffers? 

<p>
thanks,

Message-ID:  &lt;9409211926.aa25396@wolf.arl.mil&gt;

<p>

<p>
&gt; I run now in some problems running mged and xmged:
&gt; - mged attached to sgi displays a black window, program output flashes on 
&gt;   refresh so I think it could be a color map problem (?)

<p>
Inside cad/mged/dm-4d.c, you might need to add a few more "case"
statements, so that the code looks something like this:

<p>
                case INV_VGX:
                case INV_VGXT:                  /* VGX Turbo and SkyWriter */
                case INV_GMDEV:                 /* GT graphics */
                case INV_CG2:
                        ir_is_gt = 1;
                        ir_has_zbuf = 1;
                        ir_has_rgb = 1;
                        ir_has_doublebuffer = 1;
                        break;

<p>
&gt; - mged attached to X seems to work, on moss.g "ev all.g" works but the command 
&gt;   "facetize new.g all.g" causes a segmentation fault.

<p>
This is a known bug.  BRL-CAD Release 4.0 and 4.2 will die like that on
all platforms.

<p>
This is fixed in the development version of the software.  We are in the
final throes of getting the 4.4 Alpha release ready.  4 weeks after Alpha
(internal tests) we will have a Beta release (for interested sites), and
4 weeks after that we will have a formal BRL-CAD 4.4 release.

<p>
&gt; - xmged (on X) on the same command gives the messages:
&gt;   "mged_nmg_doit: bad op 0" (repeated 6 times)
&gt;   "facetize:  no resulting region, aborting"
&gt;   while "ev all.g" gives the same 6 bad op msgs and then core dumps writing
&gt;   "db_free_tree: bad op".
&gt;
&gt; - xmged attached to sgi doesn't show the colormap problem but the NMG related
&gt;   problems remains.

<p>
The fact that XMGED gives different error messages is disturbing.  I
would have expected it to fail in exactly the same way as MGED.  :-)
I'll check into this.

<p>
&gt; BTW what's the difference between the 4.0 and 4.2 releases?

<p>
BRL-CAD 4.2 contains a small handful of patches, to keep up with SGI's
continuously evolving and (only slightly) incompatible versions of IRIX.

This was first sent to the bugs list for the alpha test.  I'm forwarding
it to the main list because I'm more than a little impressed with
what Mike has done to improve the speed of processing large models
and also because there might be some people intrested in the discussion
of swapping, paging and large models.

Mike wrote:
&gt; The real problem here is that the subroutine rt_find_identical_solid()
&gt; has an O((nsolid/128)**2) search, in order to check to see if a new
&gt; solid about to be prepped is really an instance of an existing solid at
&gt; the same location and orientation.  The reason for it being (nsolid/128)
&gt; and not (nsolid) is because there are 128 different solid hashes,
&gt; and rti_solidheads[128] heads 128 different linked lists of struct
&gt; soltabs.  This reduces the search time by a constant factor, but does
&gt; not change the basic n**2 order of the search.

<p>
Very good point, I noticed the improvement when this code was installed.
About an 8 or 10 times speed up in this stage of the prep code.  Call it
12+ cpu minutes to 1.25 minutes.  Now to track down the next slow part.

<p>
&gt; This issue had come up once before, in terms of prep time for large
&gt; models.  I had addressed this issue by speeding up the matrix
&gt; comparisons, and by permitting the rt_find_identical_solid() search to
&gt; spread across up to three processors.  That provided perfectly
&gt; acceptable performance for models of O(5000) solids on ARL's multi-CPU
&gt; SGI machines.

<p>
Also, most of Mike's machines have a little more memory than mine.  So
the O(n**2) problem, while being very real, did not show the devistating
VM crawl that shows up on a small memory machine.

<p>
&gt; Chris is running on a single-CPU machine, has O(110,000) solids, and
&gt; lots of instancing, so this issue has returned.  What is called for is a
&gt; less expensive algorithm.  The current code searches the list of already
&gt; prepped solids to find other instances of the current solid.

<p>
As of last night O(500,000) and moving up.  Each tree is O(2000) solids
with out leaves and O(4000) with leaves, each target of interest is
O(8000) solids.  We are moving towards a scene with O(120,000) trees,
O(500) targets of interest, O(10000) detail items (Telephone poles,
roads, fences, dogs, cats, bears, sheds, churches et so forth).

<p>
We hope to be generating this sort of image sometime in the next two
weeks.  Oh yea, this doesn't include the 192 square kilometers of
terrain data.  That is also included.

<p>
Some comments on generating large models:

<p>
The size of our models are fairly large, but generally of O(10000) solids.
It is only when we start combining them in interesting ways that the
total size of the data base become large.

<p>
All of the large scale database generation is driven by control files
describing placement of targets within the environment.  I.e. where
each tree goes, where each target goes, where each detail item goes.

<p>
These control files also describe transformations that help hide the fact
that there are a limited number of types.  For example, we only have
5 types of trees right now, but those trees get twisted, squashed, expanded,
tilted and moved explicitly for each placement.

<p>
Each target can be individuly configured after the fact with anim scripts.

<p>
MEMORY:
Somebody said: Swapping is BAD.  This is not true.  PAGING is bad.

<p>
The time to trace my complex images in a small memory box is not much
different than the time to trace the same images in a large memory
box.  The reason for this is one Mike Muuss.  The actuall raytracing
is very memory coheasive.  There is NO noticable PAGING going on during
the tracing of a 180MB scene (Total size of rt process) in a 64MB
machine.

<p>
The PREP time, on the other hand is very nasty and is memory dependent.
The doubly linked list that Mike just added reduced the paging enormously
while building the tree.  The next step in the process seems to be doing
an O(n^2) process as well, but I have not instrumented the code enough
to be able to determine where this is happening.

<p>
Many thanks and Ataboys to Mike and his team.

<p>
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, this work was pretty easy, thanks to the new "multiple
&gt; rt_list per structure" support I added to rtlist.h a few weeks ago.
&gt; Without that support, this new algorithm would have been a pain to
&gt; code.  Power tools!

<p>
Yes, a very nice addition.  Now we can have cross threaded doubly
linked lists to confuse the best of them.  *GRIN*  But this is
a needed addition, thanks again.

<p>
From joe edward meier &lt;jem@bruker.com&gt;:

<p>
&gt;   If I am editting a large object/solid and I have the Angle Distance
&gt; Cusor (adc) showing and placed at say one end of the object, how can
&gt; I then change the view so that I see mostly the other end of the object,
&gt; without the adc moving also?  I have not been able to figure out how
&gt; to do that.

<p>
	Not sure exactly what you mean by this, but the ADC will not move
when the view is changed. If you want to keep the ADC over a particular
point in your model, you can use "adc xyz x_coord y_coord z_coord". This
will position the ADC in front of the specified coordinates. You will need
to execute the same command every time the view changes. Do an "adc help"
for more info.

<p>
&gt;   I also was wondering how one does object selection via the keyborad?
&gt; If you have alot of objects displayed, then it can be imbossible to select
&gt; the object you want via the "object illum" command?
&gt; 
	"press oill" will put you in object illuminate mode.
	"ill object" will illuminate the specified object and allow you
to select which matrix along the path should be modified. One problem with
this approach is that if the object appears in more than one path, you
will get the message "object multiply referenced" and the "ill" command
will fail. You can use "paths object" to see what paths the object appears in.

<p>

&gt; The ultimate goal is to use the Irma 3.2 USAF developed software package to

&gt; Advanced Computer Aided Design (ACAD) faceted model discription.  Most of the
&gt; target models we require have been designed using BRL-CAD or FASTGEN.  What
&gt; we need is an avenue that allows us to move BRL-CAD and FASTGEN models into
&gt; ACAD for internal component removal and facetization.  What is the simplest
&gt; way to accomplish this?

<p>
        "patch-g" will convert FASTGEN to BRL-CAD, but we don't have any
ACAD converters. See forwarded message below:

Tools to convert between BRL-CAD and ACAD in both directions are
provided by the ACAD group at Lockheed (formerly General Dynamics),

Message-ID:  &lt;9411190441.aa29487@wolf.arl.mil&gt;

<p>

<p>
Several people have recently asked whether they will have to re-register
with us or send in a new copy of the agreement form in order to obtain
a copy of BRL-CAD Release 4.4.

<p>
The answer to this question for FTP ("free") users is ---&gt; NO &lt;---.

<p>
Release 4.4 is a maintenance release, and is covered by your existing
agreement. The files for anonymous FTP will be encrypted using the same
encryption key as Release 4.0 and 4.2 were.

<p>
For folks who purchased the mag-tape version from SURVIAC, I don't know
whether there will be an additional tape-copying fee or not.

<p>
We anticipate undertaking a complete re-registration, with slightly
updated and streamlined agreement forms, for BRL-CAD Release 5.0, which
is scheduled for the end of FY95 (e.g. October 95, if not before).

I'm pleased to announce that the Beta-test version of BRL-CAD Release
4.4 (numbered 4.3 to distinguish it from the final Release) is now
available.

<p>
All current BRL-CAD users are invited to FTP the Beta test materials
from host FTP.ARL.MIL, directory brl-cad/Rel4.3/src, where you will
find these files:

<p>
The encryption key for these files is the same as was used for Release
4.0 files.

<p>
There is a mailing list which is being used for discussion of bugs
and issues uncovered in the Beta test period.  This list is
&lt;cad-beta@arl.mil&gt;, and you are welcome to subscribe to it even if
you are not planning to Beta-test the software.  Send E-mail to
&lt;cad-beta-request@arl.mil&gt; to join the list.

<p>
The Beta release contains a shell script "cadbug.sh" which all
Beta-testers are encouraged to use to report bugs in Release 4.3 with.

<p>
I apologize for the 3 week delay in getting the Beta release out.
The arrival of our first SGI "TFP" system with R8000 cpus caused far
more work in porting and bug hunting than had been anticipated. During
the Alpha test period more than 175 bug reports were filed.  Of those,
only 21 remain open as we enter the Beta test period.  I'm confident
that this will be a very successful release, even in light of the
substantial amount of new code since Release 4.2 (more than 200,000 lines!)

Subject:  New Sketch Capability in BRL-CAD's MGED
Message-ID:  &lt;9411221210.aa07525@wolf.arl.mil&gt;

<p>
	Using a method suggested by Mike Muuss, I have added a
rudimentary sketch capability to MGED.  This allows a user to
build a sketch (limited to a single loop currently) in MGED, and
then extrude that loop linearly in any direction (except parallel
to the plane of the loop). The sketch is actually an n-Manifold
Geometry (NMG) loop and when extruded, it becomes an NMG solid.

<p>
	The user begins by creating a nearly empty NMG using
the "make" command in MGED. The only geometry in an NMG created this
way is a single "wire" loop, consisting of a single edge that runs
to and from the same vertex.

<p>
	After selecting this new NMG for editing (you may have to
use the "sed" command, since the new NMG is very tiny - one vertex),
the user selects the only edge by using the "pick edge" menu item
and selecting with the mouse anywhere in the MGED window (the only
edge will be selected).

<p>
	Next, the user may select "split edge" and then use the mouse
to indicate where the new vertex should be positioned. The first mouse
selection, splits the selected edge and places the new vertex at the
mouse location creating a loop of two edges (looks like a single line).
The currently selected edge automatically shifts to the new edge,
and the user may select another location. This selection splits the
current edge and moves the new vertex to the selected location, creating
a triangular loop. The user may continue to build the sketch by repeatedly
selecting points with the mouse or using the "p" command.

<p>
	There is also a "delete edge" menu item that will delete the
currently selected edge, and a "move edge" menu item to allow moving
an edge perpendicular to its length.

<p>
	The sketch is mantained always as a loop, and when the user
is satisfied with the sketch, the "extrude loop" menu item may be
selected to produce an extruded solid. This works similar to other
solid editing items as the user may use any number of mouse point
selections or "p" commands to produce different extrusions until
the desired effect is accomplished.  Then the usual "ACCEPT" or
"REJECT" menu item is selected.

<p>
	The "split edge" and "delete edge" menu items are currently
restricted to use on "wire" loops or "wire" edges. They will not work
on solid NMG objects. "Move edge" will work on simple NMG solids as well
as "wire" edges, and the "extrude loop" will only work on NMG's that
contain a single "wire" loop.

<p>
	Most of these capabilities are in the current BETA release,
but the "extrude loop" wasn't completed until last night (Nov 21).
It will appear in any new BETA releases and in the final 4.4 release.

Message-ID:  &lt;9411221130.aa06788@wolf.arl.mil&gt;

<p>

<p>
	Using a method suggested by Mike Muuss, I have added a
rudimentary sketch capability to MGED. This has been accomplished
by including NMG's to the "make" command, allowing the creation
of a nearly empty NMG. The only geometry in an NMG created this
way is a single "wire" loop, consisting of a single edge that runs
to and from the same vertex.
	New menu items have been added to the NMG solid edit menu
that allow splitting edges.  The user may select "split edge" and
then use the mouse to indicate where the new vertex should be
positioned. The user may continue to build the sketch by repeatedly
selecting points with the mouse or using the "p" command.
	There is also a "delete edge" menu item that will delete the
currently selected edge, and a "move edge" menu item to allow moving
an edge perpendicular to its length.
	Note that these menu items will not currently work for the
typical NMG solid, but only "wire" loops. The "move edge" will
work for simple NMG solid objects.
	The sketch is mantained always as a loop, and when the user
is satisfied with the sketch, the "extrude loop" menu item may be
selected to produce an extruded solid. This works similar to other
solid editing items as the user may use any number of mouse point
selections or "p" commands to produce different extrusions until
the desired effect is accomplished.  Then the usual "ACCEPT" or
"REJECT" menu item is selected.

<p>

<p>
Based upon the feedback we have received since the Beta test period has
started, a number of small but important improvements have been made,
primarily in the realm of portability, but also some new features.

<p>
The most notable new features are courtesy of Timothy Smith and the
crew at Sun Microsystems, who have contributed a really nice X11 module
for LIBFB which supports 24, 8, and 1 bit visuals.  They have also
contributed improved Sun XGL support for MGED which is compatible with
Solaris and can take advantage of Sun graphics accelerator hardware.

<p>
Sun is working hard to make their systems run BRL-CAD "as well as an SGI
does".  While they still have some work to do in the area of graphics
performance, their RT performance is astonishingly good.  In my very
rough initial testing, a 50 MHz (each) 4-CPU Hyper-SPARC SS10BSX system
with Solaris 2.4 (summary RTFM=178.69) ran more than 2.5 times as fast
as a 1-CPU 150 MHz R4400 based SGI Indigo**2 with Irix 5.2 (summary
RTFM=63.89).  More than just MegaHertz matters!

<p>
As before, the beta test sources can be found on host FTP.ARL.MIL
in the directory "brl-cad/Rel4.3/src":

Thanks for all of the nice words, Mike.

<p>
One minor correction:  The system you have has 4 SuperSPARC processors,
not 4 hyperSPARC processors.  The hyperSPARC was just recently
introduced and only FCSed yesterday.  It is a 100MHz part that is
roughly a third faster (according to the SPEC numbers) than the
SuperSPARC processors you currently have.  I have not had a chance to
benchmark the hyperSPARC yet but hope to soon.  The hyperSPARC has a
smaller cache than the SuperSPARC so it will be interesting to see how
it compares on the RT benchmark.

Subject:  BRL-CAD 4.4 and FASTGEN
Message-ID:  &lt;9411091645.aa13033@wolf.arl.mil&gt;

<p>

<p>
	A new release of BRL-CAD is coming soon, so for those of you
who have been using FASTGEN, here is an update on what to expect in the new
release.

<p>
	PATCH-G has been updated to take advantage of the new NMG
capabilities in BRL-CAD. Plate mode components in FASTGEN are described
as triangular faces with a specified thickness.  These triangles are
converted to NMG triangular faces and then extruded by the thickness of the 
plate to create a true solid in BRL-CAD. Previously, these components were
converted by building an ARB6 (an extruded triangle) for each triangle in
the plate mode object. This resulted in cracks or overlaps where two adjacent
triangles were not coplanar. The new method extrudes the entire surface of
triangles to produce a single solid with no cracks or overlaps for the plate
mode object. Volume mode component in FASTGEN may also be described using
triangular faces. These are also converted to BRL-CAD NMG solids. There is a
user option to have the final BRL-CAD NMG solids written to the database as
polysolids rather than as NMG's. The NMG's are more flexible and carry more
information about the solid (topology as well as geometry), but for most
current vulnerability analyses the polysolids will be adequate. The remainder
of the FASTGEN object types are converted to corresponding BRL-CAD solids
in the same manner as the previous release.

<p>
	A FASTGEN4 to BRL-CAD converter has been added to the BRL-CAD
package. This code was described in an earlier note to this list. It
converts the new NASTRAN-like FASTGEN4 to BRL-CAD in a manner similar
to the PATCH-G converter.

<p>
	FASTGEN users reading this should also be aware of the BURST code
written by Gary Moss. This code produces shotline output for parallel ray
grids or for bursting (disribution of rays emanating from a single point).
This output may be used with the Air Force Point Burst Damage Assessment
Model (PDAM), and is is in a format suitable for filtering to an unformatted
file to mimic FASTGEN output.  Leonard "Bud" Bruenning &lt;bruennin@uv3.eglin.af.mil&gt;
is the keeper of the BURST code if you need more information.

<p>
	There is also an RTG3 code to produce parallel ray shotlines from a
BRL-CAD model in a form like that produced by the old GIFT code (3 components
per line). This shotline output is compatible with the COVART family of
vulnerability anaysis codes.

<p>
&gt; John,
&gt; 
&gt; Great work.  As someone who is constantly representing BRL-CAD to
&gt; the outside world (JTCG, TILV, etc., etc.), I really appreciate
&gt; the importance - political as well as technical - of your
&gt; accomplishment.  Thanks for making my job much easier.

<p>
	My pleasure, Thanks!
 
&gt; I had a thought (unaccustomed as I am ....):  In the process of
&gt; bisecting the "cracks" or "overlaps" between plates, you had to
&gt; determine the intersection line between the plates on the top and
&gt; bottom surfaces, right?  That means that - at that time - you new
&gt; where the edges of the plates were.  Well, I would like to point
&gt; out that lots of people would really like the ability to determine
&gt; just that: folks who are trying to propagate ballistic shock,
&gt; folks that are trying to determine the extent of panels for blast
&gt; loading, folks that are trying to establish zones for combined
&gt; blast-fragment synergistic effects, etc.  Is there potential
&gt; spin-off here?

<p>
	Maybe, but let me give you a few more details.
Then you can tell me if we are talking about the same thing.

<p>
The plate mode objects in a FASTGEN description are typically described
as a series of triangles, each with an assigned thickness.  This method
is normally used for shapes that cannot be described any other way in
FASTGEN. Things like aircraft skin, tank turrets, ... anything that is
not a box, cylinder, cone, sphere, ellipsoid, or torus. In the previous
version of the "patch-g" converter, each triangle was converted to an
individual solid by extruding each triangle individually. The resulting
solids produced the  "cracks" or "overlaps" with their neighbors.
The method I used, does not require bisecting these  "cracks" or "overlaps".
I combine all the triangles from one component into a single NMG surface
(the surface consists of the triangles from the FASTGEN component). I then
make a copy of this surface, calculate new plane equations for triangular
faces (translating each plane by the assigned thickness in the appropriate
direction), and (using the new plane equations) calculate new vertices
at the intersection of the faces (much detail omitted here). More faces
are added to connect the outer edges of the original surface and the
extruded copy, resulting in a true NMG solid.

<p>
So, the  "cracks" or "overlaps" had been occurring where two triangles of
a plate mode component adjoined. This is just a artifact of the method used
to describe the component (triangular facets used to approximate smooth
surfaces). I doubt that is what you are looking for.

<p>
However, the new NMG capability in BRL-CAD may be what you want. As well
as storing geometry, the NMG objects contain topology as well. If I have
a face of an NMG object, I can easily get a list of its edges and vertices.
It is simple to go on from there to find neighboring faces and their
edges and vertices. The entire object can be traversed in this way.
Also, edges in an NMG object are labelled as "real" if they represent
real edges and are not just the result of tessellation. For example,
a pilots head might be described as an ellipsoid. Currently, if this is
converted to an NMG object, it will be approximated by a series of facets.
None of the edges in this NMG will be flagged as "real" edges. If, however,
his head was described as a box, all the edges in the corresponding NMG
would be "real".

<p>
Just to be sure you are aware of what's coming, we are currently working
to extend NMG objects to allow TNURB (Trimmed Non-Uniform Rational B-spline)
faces instead of just planar faces. When this is complete, tank turrets,
a/c skin, (and pilot heads, too) may be described without approximating
facets.

<p>

<p>
	I think I got carried away with this response, but does this
sound like what you are looking for??

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>
	The JTCG/ME ATV Subgroup task to develop a FASTGEN4 to BRL-CAD geometry
translator has been completed.  This capability will be distributed in the
next BRL-CAD release.

<p>
	The FASTGEN4 CHEX1, CQUAD, and CTRI elements (in plate-mode or volume-mode)
are converted to the users choice of BRL-CAD NMG's or polysolids.  In rare cases,
the method used to create NMG's from plate-mode elements fails. When this happens,
the converter makes a second attempt to convert the component by reverting back
to the methodology used in earlier "patch-g" converters, i.e., each triangle in
the plate-mode object is converted to an "arb6".  CCONE1 and CCONE2
elements are converted to BRL-CAD "gentgc" solids with internal "gentgc" solids
subtracted if necessary. CSPHERE elements are converted to BRL-CAD "genell" solids
with interior "genell" solids subtracted for the plate-mode cases. CHEX2 elements
are converted to BRL-CAD "arb8" solids.  CLINE elements are converted to BRL-CAD
"gentgc" solids with inner "gentgc" solids subtracted in the plate-mode cases.
CLINE elements that share endpoints with other CLINE elements in the same component
are connected by spheres ("genell" solids) at the common endpoints (again, with
interior spheres subtracted in plate-mode).  These "genell" solids have the same
radii as the connecting CLINE elements.  HOLE and WALL elements are handled by
region subtraction in BRL-CAD.

<p>
	Unique names are assigned to all the resulting BRL-CAD components. If
the FASTGEN4 model includes $NAME records, that text information is used
to build a name within the constraints of the BRL-CAD name-space. If no $NAME
record is found for a component, a name is constructed from the group and
component numbers.  The user may specify a "-w" flag on the command line to
get a warning for every component that does not have a $NAME record.  The
components are grouped according to the FASTGEN4 "group" number, and a top
level group named "all" (containing all the other groups) is created.

<p>
	BRL-CAD "region id" numbers are constructed as the FASTGEN4 "group
number" times 1000 plus the FASTGEN4 "component number".

<p>
	A BRL-CAD manual page has been prepared and is included in the
BRL-CAD distribution along with the FASTGEN4 to BRL-CAD converter ("fast4-g").

<p>
	This converter has been tested using two models received from Mr.
Marty Lentz - the F4E and the MH60.  Of the 954 components in the F4E, 918
are converted on the first try and an additional 32 are converted on the
second try (using "arb6" solids). This leaves 4 components that failed
to convert.  The MH60 has 1016 components, 1006 converted on the first
pass and 8 more converted as collections of "arb6" solids. Two components
of the MH60 failed to convert. All six of the components that failed to
convert can be attributed to errors in the FASTGEN4 model.  The original
MH60 FASTGEN4 model was modified during the development of this converter
to eliminate some of the FASTGEN4 errors, and the results quoted are for
the modified model. The F4E was not modified in any way.

Hi Joe -

<p>
In your letter you didn't mention which version of BRL-CAD you are
working with.  That makes something of a difference.  If you are running
Release 4.0, 4.1, or 4.2, the NMG support is not very robust.

<p>
As of now, there are very few NMG-related commands in MGED, although
those few deliver a lot of functionality.  You can use MGED's built-in
"help" command to give you a 1-line summary of each:

<p>
ev		evaluate combinations into polygons for display.
facetize	evaluate region into an NMG solid, and store in database.

<p>
In addition, the "make" command will now (in 4.3beta2) allow you to
create an NMG which is a loop of a single vertex and a single edge
("make name.s nmg"), which you can then select for solid editing ("sed
name.s").  Using the solid editing menu, you can then use the "pick
edge", and "split edge" items to sketch out a 2-D curve in the plane of
the current view.  Select another view, pick "extrude loop" from the
menu, and then *voila!*, you have built yourself an NMG solid! The
extrusion can also be controlled via the "p" command, where you specify
the XYZ coordinates of a point to lie on the plane of the extruded face.

<p>
There are a few other commands that interact with the NMG support, such

<p>
For a fascinating visual display of how the NMG boolean library
implementes the "ev" command, say "debugnmg 3" before running the "ev"
command.

<p>
Suggestions for additional NMG support in MGED are welcomed.  I've got
plenty of ideas, myself. Contributions of code implementing those
suggestions are even more welcome!  :-)

&gt;a quick qestion for a novice -- what do i need to use the "html" files?
&gt;
&gt;(and is there a freeware source on line?)

<p>
The most popular browser for WWW/html documents is "Mosaic" available from
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.  It requires motif to compile, or you have to trust
the binary they have out for ftp (ugh).

<p>
If you don't have motif and don't want to trust the NCSA binary out for ftp
(and why should you?), I'd suggest getting a copy of "chimera" from
ftp.cs.unlv.edu.  It only requres X and the athena widget set to compile.

| Yes.  There is an enhanced version of MGED known as XMGED that requires
| Motif in order to compile and run.  Regular MGED continues to be available
| and supports X based on libx11 alone, but has a much more primitive
| interface.  We may someday build an XMGED that does not depend on Motif,

<p>
It -is- a nice feature of BRL-CAD that it does not entirely depend upon Motif
to work.  Some vendors (read DEC) still insist upon "nickel-and-diming" you
at every opportunity, and for awhile their Motif upgrade was big, BIG, $$$.
Although, in fairness, they have become more reasonable of late.

<p>
If applications such as XMGED become the norm, then it would be nice to see
BRL-CAD eventually adopt a standard metaphorically akin to LIBPKG which would
allow the utilities to support differing windows technologies (ie, plain X,
X-with-Motif, X-under-Windows, Windows-NT, etc).

<p>
Perhaps a better metaphor would be LIBFB instead of LIBPKG.  Actually, maybe
expanding LIBFB to include windowing might be a consideration.  Have LIBFB
return to the application the graphics ability of the "frame buffer," and there
decide whether or not to support a windowing option.  And, if selected, let
LIBFB absorb all of the hardware/vendor-dependent stuff.

<p>
Thoughts?

Message-ID:  &lt;9412211057.aa04585@wolf.arl.mil&gt;

<p>

<p>
     I implemented a new output item called "scaled_los" to complement the
existing output item "los".  The values of these two output items are

<p>
    los		line-of-sight distance through the current partition,
		equivalent to (d_in - d_out).  This is unchanged from
		previous versions of NIRT(1).

<p>
    scaled_los	scaled line-of-sight distance through the current
		partition, the product of los and the region's
		solidity (also known variously as its percent LOS,
		thickness factor, and volumetric percentage of
		material (!)).  This is a brand-new feature.

<p>
I would have called the new output item "weighted_los", but apparently
that might have caused confusion in the MUVES community, where weighting
an LOS means multiplying it by the region's solidity AND ITS DENSITY.
     Of course, to use this new output item one must tailor the output
formats as explained in the man page nirt.1.

<p>
Those of you trying to compile the 4.3beta3 release on IRIX 5.2 will
need to modify the Cakefile.defs file.  There are bad side effects
from using -Wl,-w2 -- if *any* warning message is printed by the loader,
it seems to abort the load.  This wasn't the intention.

<p>
For the time being -Wl,-w1 seems to be having the desired effect.

<p>
The whole "-w" option on LD is not documented by SGI at all, but their
Hotline suggested using it in place of the documented "-S" option,
which does not work.  Sorry about the blundering around in the dark.

Per Chris Johnson:

<p>
Hello, here is the exhostive 0-15 on -w options.
only the valuses 1-3 are acceptable.
1 = surpress all warnings plus all errors (default)
2 = error off on any warning or error
3 = surpress all warnign s plus all errors AND error off on any warning or

Looks like -w1 is the best we can do, then.

&gt; I will be traveling to work in the United Kingdom (University College
&gt; London) for two years beginning in May 1995.  I gather it would not be
&gt; proper to just take a take of the current version of BRLCAD with me to
&gt; England.  I also understand it would not be proper to just ftp a new
&gt; copy (without some prior formal arrangement for permission acquire new
&gt; versions by anonymous ftp and decrypt the package in another country).
&gt; 
&gt; Approaching the British Foreign Office to obtain a copy of BRLCAD for
&gt; a United States national seems a bit awkward.  Nevertheless, it may be
&gt; the proper approach to obtaining permission to use BRLCAD in England.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I would appreciate advice about the appropriate procedure to follow
&gt; to obtain BRLCAD for use in England.

<p>
Congratulations on your foreign appointment!  UCL is a cool place, and
I'm sure you will have a splendid time there.

<p>
Thanks for asking what the proper procedure is.  It is no longer
necessary to involve the Foreign Office for overseas distribution.
Fortunately we were able to eliminate that step many years ago.

<p>
BRL-CAD agreements are executed either by (a) a private individual,
when their use is for personal use, or (b) a corporation or institution.
In your case, I believe that your current agreement is executed by
your current University.  Since you are temporarily changing
affiliations, simply fill out and return an agreement through UCL, and
rest easy.

<p>
Since you already have the BRL-CAD materials, and UCL is (will be) a
registered site, you are free to take whatever materials you like along
with you in whatever manner is most convenient to you.  Your associates
here in the States can continue to work with your original set.

<p>
That's all there is to it!  Hopefully sending in the one form won't be
much of an inconvenience to you.  It will be a big help to us!

<p>
THE BIG PICTURE

<p>
I was recently informed that BRL-CAD is the U.S. Army's #1 "Technology
Transfer Product".  It's also the only one that is still available
without charge to any who want it.  These are both points of pride for
those of us who developed it.

<p>
In this time of downsizing, it is important that the usefulness of our
BRL-CAD work continue to be recognized, to help us protect our funding
line. The "survey" form that you return with your BRL-CAD agreement is
our primary source of documentation to support our position.

<p>
Over the years I have worked to streamline the agreement process as much
as possible.  I like to believe that the procedure and forms we have
been using since Release 4.0 started are not overly burdensome. As we
come up on Release 4.4 Mary Monk and I will be working on an improved
version of the forms and procedures to further streamline distribution
to foreign sites.

<p>
My thanks to all of you, the BRL-CAD users, for making BRL-CAD a success!

<p>
	Happy Holidays!

<p>

<p>
This evening, while tracking a performance issue on the Sun XGL display
manager relating to drawing speed of dot-dashed lines in MGED, I
added two new options to the "e" and "ev" command in MGED:

<p>
-s	Draws all subtraction and intersection solids with solid lines,
	rather than using the usual dot-dash pattern.

<p>
-v	When used with EV, shade polygons with per-vertex surface normals,
	rather than flat-shading them with the face normal.
	This makes much "prettier" looking curved shapes, for
	presentations.

Message-ID:  &lt;9412272252.aa25329@wolf.arl.mil&gt;

<p>
I don't know why the remote framebuffer library never had a routine
to support remotely defining the shape of the cursor.  However, Sue
Coates' bug report is quite accurate -- it doesn't work. I defined a new
kind of remote framebuffer PKG to implement the missing routine:
MSG_FBSETCURSOR.

<p>
In order to prevent having a new LGT get stuck waiting forever for
the MSG_RETURN package when using an old RFBD framebuffer server,
I made if_remote.c send the request with flag MSG_NORETURN.  This way
old framebuffer servers will log the message "pkg_dispatch: no handler
for message type 131, len 20" and harmlessly ignore it, without hanging
the user application (like LGT).

&gt; As far as I am aware, there is no current editing capability in either

<p>
In the Beta release (BRL-CAD Release 4.3), there exists some modest MGED
editing capability for *both* planar NMGs and the existing NURBS solids.
In the case of NURBS solids, the editing is restricted to moving control
points around using the mouse.  This is probably acceptable for simple
"by eye" touch-up, but is a far cry from "sophisticated" B-spline
editing.
