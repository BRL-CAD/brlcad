BRL-CAD Code Review
===================

...what to look for during a review...

Legal:
 * proper copyright statement and compatible license?
 * any indication contribution disagrees with copyright assignment?
 * if incorporating 3rd party code, prefer bsd/mit-style options

Architecture:
 * proper location in hierarchy?
 * proper file name(s)?
 * is a dependency being introduced?
 * is a cyclic dependency being introduced?
 * are any global variables being introduced?

Design:
 * is public API minimized?
 * is a platform symbol being used?
 * does the change reduce or violate modularity?
 * is the approach being taken reasonable?
 * is the code easy to understand?

Testing:
 * compiles cleanly?
 * are warnings handled cleanly?
 * any blatant logic errors?
 * are all data inputs checked properly, sanitized?
 * if fixing a bug more than once, is there a test?
 * is a unit test warranted?
 * are there major robustness issues?

Documentation:
 * if publicly visible, is NEWS updated?
 * if public API changed, is CHANGES updated?
 * if public API introduced, does every symbol have a comment?
 * if interface changed, are man page or other docs updated?
 * are numeric constants documented?
 * is suspicious, complex, risky code commented?

Code:
 * conforms with style and coding standards?
 * proper indentation, formatting, whitespace?
 * are symbol names consistent?
 * is duplication being introduced, refactoring warranted?
 * is there undocumented dead / commented-out code?
 * can any code be replaced with library calls?
