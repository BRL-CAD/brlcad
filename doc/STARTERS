Summary:
 * Replace SCLstring with std::string
Description:
 * The NIST STEP Class Library (SCL) was written before the standard
   template library (STL) was prevalent, so a custom class was written
   to encompass variable length strings called SCLstring.  This task
   involves updating the SCL to use STL strings and creating new
   functions as necessary for any SCLstring capabilities not provided
   by the STL.
Objectives:
 * Replace all usage of SCLString within the NIST (SCL) with the
   standard template library std::string type
 * Delete SCLString class
Difficulty:
 * Easy
Prerequisites:
 * Basic familiarity with C++ STL
