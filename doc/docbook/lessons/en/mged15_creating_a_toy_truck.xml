      <para>
	To make the hood of the cab, you will need to make another rpp shape, this
	time using the inside command. This special command was originally created
	to hollow out objects such as gas tanks and boxes; however, it can be used
	to create any new shape that has some relationship to a pre-existing
	shape. In this lesson, it is used to cut away material above the hood and
	in front of the cab.

      <note>
	<para>
	  Note that in <application>BRL-CAD</application> versions 6.0 and later, the faces of an rpp are  
	  numbered in a different order than in previous versions. So, if you   
	  are using a pre-6.0 release of the package, the following parameter   
	  order must be used for the aforementioned inside command:             
	  
	  <command>inside cab1.s caboff1.s -.1 .7 -.1 -.1 .5 -.1[Enter]</command>
	  
	  (The order of faces in this case is front, rear, right, left, bottom, 
	  top instead of that specified for versions 6.0 and later.)

    <section xml:id="truck_cab_wheel_well"><info><title>Using an rcc to Create a Wheel Well in the Cab</title></info>
      
      <para>
	Make a cylinder (rcc) to use for cutting away a space for the first wheel
	of the cab. At the Command Window prompt, type:
	
	<command>make well1.s rcc[Enter]</command>
	
	Go to the Edit menu and click on Primitive Selection, then well1.s. After
	selecting a Left view, go back to Edit and select Scale. Reduce the size
	of the rcc until its diameter is about the right size for a wheel well. Go
	back to Edit and select Rotate. As discussed previously, one way to easily
	rotate the rcc is by using the CTRL key and the left mouse button to drag
	the top lip of the rcc down (in a straight line) until the A and C edit
	labels overlap. However, because we know we want to flip the object
	exactly 90'0 along the x axis, a better choice is to use the Command Line
	and type:
	
	<command>p 90 0 0[Enter]</command>
	
	After doing so, you may still have to use the Set H and Scale
	editing options to resize and the SHIFT key and left mouse
	button to position your wheel well. When satisfied, select
	Accept on the Edit menu. Your design should look similar to
	the following in Multipane mode:

	The GUI environment of <application>MGED</application> offers
	users several options for applying, accepting, or rejecting
	changes made through buttons at the bottom of dialog pop-up
	windows. To use any of these options, just place the mouse
	cursor over the desired button and click the left mouse
	button.
      </para>
      <para>
	Selecting the Accept or OK button will
	tell <application>MGED</application> to record the changes you
	have made to a shape, region, or
	combination. <application>MGED</application> uses the Accept
	and OK buttons interchangeably. When you select Accept or OK,
	the window you are using will automatically close.
      </para>
      <para>
	The Apply button tells <application>MGED</application> to
	apply a change you have made and wait for further
	instructions. The window does not automatically close. This
	enables you to make changes to several things without having
	to reopen the window for each change.
      </para>
      <para>
	The Reset button tells <application>MGED</application> to
	reset values you have changed in a dialog box to the last
	values you applied or accepted. The Reset button does not
	close the dialog box. The Cancel or Dismiss buttons discard
	any changes made in the dialog box and leave values unchanged
	from their last stored settings. These two buttons close the
	dialog box.

	edited through the dialog box (or myPrimitive if nothing has been edited).
	Erase the old shape's name in the Name entry box. Type in well1.s and
	press Reset (or press Enter while the cursor is still in the Name entry
	box). The parameter values of the old shape will be replaced by those of

    <section xml:id="stacker_shading"><info><title>The Stacker Option</title></info>
      
      <para>
	In previous lessons, you applied color and a shader to an object to make
	it appear realistic. Sometimes, however, you will need to apply two or
	three shaders to an object to get the design you want.
      </para>
      <para>
	<application>MGED</application> offers three categories of shaders: paint, plastic, and light. Any
	combination of these three types of shaders can be applied to the same
	object using the stacker option of the shader menu.
      </para>
      <para>
	There are three plastic shaders: glass, mirror, and plastic. A plastic
	shader is used to give the perception of space. It does this by making the
	object's surface shiny so that it reflects light. A plastic shader is
	normally applied last in the stacker process.
      </para>
      <para>
	The paint shaders are used to apply pigment and texture to the surface of
	an object. Color is pigment, and texture is the three-dimensional quality
	of the surface material (such as stucco paint).
      </para>
      <para>
	Pigment shaders include camo, texture (color), texture (black/white), fake
	star, cloud, checker, test map, and projection. Texture shaders include
	bump map, fbm bump, and tur bump. Paint shaders are normally applied first
	in the stacking process and are used in combination with the plastic
	shader.
      </para>
      <para>
	The light shader is used to produce illumination in the scene. This helps
	produce realism in the final image. The light shader is technically
	complex and is not discussed in this tutorial.
      </para>
      <para>
	The camo shader involves applying pigments, in a random pattern, to the
	surface of an object. The camo shader doesn't indicate the
	three-dimensional nature of an object. If you want your design to show
	depth, you will need to stack the camo shader and the plastic shader.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="using_stacker_shading"><info><title>Using the Stacker Option</title></info>
      
      <para>
	To use the stacker option, open the Combination Editor and select
	truck1.r. Click on the button to the right of the Shader entry box and
	then select stack from the drop-down menu. A button with the words Add
	Shader will appear under the text box. Click on the button and then select
	camouflage. Set the Background Color to black (0 0 0), Color #1 to green
	(0 134 0), and Color #2 to rust brown (164 96 38). Make the Noise Size
	.25. Click on Add Shader once again and select plastic.
      </para>
      <para>
	At this point, your Combination Editor window may have gone off the bottom
	of the screen. If this happens, reduce the size of the window as much as
	you can and then drag it up to the top of the screen. The buttons at the
	bottom of the box should now appear, and you can Apply your selections.
      </para>

      <caution>
	<para>
	  When using the stacker option, you need to keep track of the 
	  number of characters and spaces in the shader text box. <application>MGED</application> versions 
	  prior to release 6.0 will only recognize 64 characters/spaces, so be  
	  careful stacking shaders with complex attributes.                     
	</para>
      </caution>

    <section xml:id="truck_raytracing"><info><title>Raytracing the Truck</title></info>
      
      <para>
	The last step in creating your truck is to raytrace your design. When the
	raytracer has finished, notice that the top and one side of the truck are
	very dark. This is because there is very little light falling on them.
	Because we have not specified any light sources for our scene, <application>MGED</application>
	provides us with a set of default lights. These defaults consist of a dim
	light at the location of the viewer and a brighter one located to the left
	and below the viewer. Since the primary light is not really shining on one
	side of the truck, it is dark.
      </para>
      <para>
	There is a special adjustment we can make to improve the overall
	brightness of the scene. We can adjust the amount of ambient light, which
	is light that does not come from a particular light source but is a
	measure of the light generally present in the scene. To adjust the amount
	of ambient light, click on the Advanced Settings button in the Raytrace
	Control Panel. Next to Other Options, type -A .9 and click Dismiss. Now
	when you raytrace, you will get a much lighter image.
