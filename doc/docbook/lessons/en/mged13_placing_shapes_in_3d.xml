      The design you will make in this lesson is a simple candle in a candle
      holder sitting on a table (as shown in the following figure). In the next
      lesson, you will add decorations and lighting to make the design more
      realistic.

      <para>
	Go to the Edit option of the menu bar. The arb8 needs to be made larger,
	so, under the Edit menu, select Scale. Put the mouse pointer in the upper
	half of the screen to make the arb8 larger and click the middle mouse
	button until the sides of the arb8 touch each side of the screen. Use the
	SHIFT key and left mouse button to drag the arb into position, if
	necessary.

	Under the Edit menu, select Move Faces and then Move Face 4378. Place the

	button until the arb8 is about the thickness of a tabletop. Go back to
	Edit and Accept the changes, and then use the SHIFT and any mouse key to
	position the tabletop so that it appears similar to the following:

    <section xml:id="candle_create_base"><info><title>Creating the Candle Base</title></info>
      
      <para>
	Create an eto and name it eto1.s. To create the bottom of the candle base,
	you will need to flip the eto 180'0. Type at the Command Window prompt:
	
	<command>rot 0 180 0[Enter]</command>
	
	This tells <application>MGED</application> to rotate the shape 180'0 along the y axis. Next, select
	Scale and make the eto a little smaller than its default size. Place the
	eto on the tabletop by using the SHIFT key and left mouse button to drag
	the base into position.
      </para>

      <para>
	View your design from different angles to make sure the eto sits flush on
	the center of the tabletop. Click on Accept when you are satisfied with
	its size and placement. Your base should be similar to the one shown as
	follows:

      <para>
	The next step in creating a candle base is to make a right circular
	cylinder (rcc). Name the shape rcc1.s.
      </para>
      <para>
	Go to Edit. In addition to the standard commands, you will be presented
	with a menu of thirteen shape-specific ways to edit this shape.

      <para>
	Scale the shape until it is slightly larger in diameter than the top of
	the eto1.s (you can check this by switching to a top view). Go back to
	Edit and select Set H. Reduce the height of the shape until the rcc is
	about two times the height of eto1.s. Position the cylinder on the
	candle-holder base. Check the placement of the rcc from the top, left, and
	front to ensure that it is centered in the eto. Make sure the bottom of
	the rcc is not quite touching the tabletop. Accept your changes. When
	done, your design should look like the following:

      </para>

      <para>
	The last step in making the candle base is to create another eto. Name it
	eto2.s. Edit this shape as you did the previous eto and place it on top of
	the rcc, as shown in the following figure. Accept your changes when
	finished. Your candle base should now look like this:

      </para>
      <para>
	Make a region of the three shapes of the base. Name it base1.r. Your
	Boolean expression should read:
	
	<command>r base1.r u eto1.s u rcc1.s u eto2.s</command>
	
	Note that we could have written it
	
	<command>r base1.r u eto1.s u eto2.s u rcc1.s</command>
	
	but the first expression is preferred to be consistent with the order of a
	later example. In a moment, we will want to remove some material that
	eto2.s gives us. By placing eto2.s last in the list, we can perform this
	removal easily.

    <section xml:id="candle_create_candle"><info><title>Creating the Candle</title></info>
      
      <para>
	Create an rcc and name it rcc2.s. Edit the shape as you did the previous
	rcc. When you are done, it should look similar to the one in the following
	illustration. (Note: After you have accepted the changes, you can get all
	of your tabletop and candle in the Graphics Window by using the SHIFT key
	and left mouse button to move your view of the design.)

      <para>
	Make a region of the candle. Your Boolean statement should read:
	
	<command>r candle1.r u rcc2.s</command>
	
	Now we create a cylindrical cutout in the base for the candle to sit in.
	To do this we can use the shape of the candle, as follows:
	
	<command>r base1.r - rcc2.s</command>
	
	Earlier we had mentioned that we would want to remove some material that
	we got from eto2.s. Now we have done it.

	Now that you have made a number of regions and a combination, it would be
	a good time to check your data tree and make sure it agrees with the
	following tree. If you find that you have made a mistake in any of the
	parts of the tree, you can change them in the Boolean Expression box of
	the Combination Editor (refer to Lesson 5). At the Command Line prompt,
	type:
	
	<command>tree candle1.c[Enter]</command>
	
	Your Boolean expression should read:

	Notice that the checker shader for the tabletop includes two color values
	and a scale value. Type the values for red, white, and a scale of 10 in
	the boxes, as follows:

      </para>
      <para>
	For the rest of the elements of the design, use the Color Tool to make the
	colors shown or simply type them in the Color text box, remembering to
	leave a space between each set of numbers.
      </para>

      <note>
	<para>
	  As discussed previously, a color is made up of three numbers, ranging 
	  from 0 to 255. The first number represents the amount of red, the     
	  second represents the amount of green, and the third represents the   
	  amount of blue used to make the color. A color of 0 0 0 is black, and 
	  255 255 255 is white. This method of creating colors is different     
	  from mixing pigment colors used in painting because you are dealing   
	  with light. While it may seem strange at first, most <application>MGED</application> users       
	  quickly become adept at creating RGB colors.
