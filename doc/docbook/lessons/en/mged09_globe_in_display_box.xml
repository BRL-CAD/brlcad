      <para>
	Begin by creating a new database. Name your new file cube.g.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="globe_create_display_box"><info><title>Creating the Display Box</title></info>

      <para>
	Go to the Create menu, select the Arbs category, and then select an arb8
	(arbitrary convex polyhedron with eight vertices). When asked to provide a
	name for the arb8, name it cube1.s. Click on Apply. Go to the Edit menu
	and select Accept. You now have a cube for the outside of the display
	box, as in the following:

      </informalfigure>

      </para>

      <para>
	Repeat the first part of this process to produce another arb8, this time
	calling this shape cube2.s. Go to the Edit menu and select Scale. Place
	the mouse pointer in the lower half of the Graphics Window screen and
	click the middle mouse button until the second cube is slightly smaller
	than the first cube, as follows:

      </para>

      <para>
	Go to the View menu and change view to Front. Go to the Edit menu and
	select Translate (move). Hold down the SHIFT key and drag the inside
	cube into position in the center of the outside cube. Repeat this process
	from the Top view and Left view until the smaller cube is placed in the
	center of the outside cube when viewed from all perspectives. When you are
	finished, go back to the Edit menu and select Accept.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="create_globe_in_box"><info><title>Create a Globe Inside the Display Box</title></info>

      <para>
	Go to the Create menu and select sph from the list of Ellipsoids. Name the
	shape globe1.s and select Apply.
      </para>

      <para>
	A sphere should appear inside the cube in the Graphics Window. Change View
	to Front.
      </para>

      <para>
	Go to the Edit menu and select Scale. Reduce the size of the sphere until
	it will fit inside of the cube and then drag it into the center of the
	cube. Go to Edit and Accept your changes. Your globe and box should appear
	similar to the following in the az35, el25 view:

	To view contents of the database, type at the Command Window prompt:

	<command>ls[Enter]</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	You should see cube1.s, cube2.s, and globe1.s listed as shapes you have
	created. To make regions of these shapes, type at the prompt:

	<command>r cube1.r u cube1.s - cube2.s[Enter]</command>

	<command>r globe1.r u globe1.s[Enter]</command>

    <section xml:id="globe_assign_mater_prop"><info><title>Using the Combination Editor to Assign Material Properties that Make
      the Objects Appear More Realistic</title></info>


      <para>
	Go to Edit and select Combination Editor. In the dialog box, click the
	button next to the Name entry box. Select globe1.r from Select From All or
	Select From All Regions. Double click  on the globe1.r name. Assign this
	region a Shader of cloud. Check the Boolean Expression box to make sure
	the region is made up of u globe1.s. Click on Apply to accept your
	choices. Go to View and select az35, el25.
      </para>

      <para>
	Go back to Name and select cube1.r from the Select From All menu. Assign
	this region a Shader of glass. The glass shader is a shortcut to
	individually changing the attributes of the plastic shader to make it
	appear like glass.
      </para>

      <para>
	Go to the Color option and enter the values 244 255 255. This will give
	your glass box a light cyan color. Click on Apply to accept your changes.
      </para>

      <para>
	Before you can raytrace your design, you need to clear the Graphics Window
	by typing Z at the Command Window prompt because both shapes and regions
	are being displayed at this point. Next, type in the Command Window:

	<command>draw cube1.r globe1.r[Enter]</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	The display box and globe should reappear in the Graphics Window. Go to
	the File menu and select Raytrace. Next, select the white option for
	Background Color. Click on Raytrace.
      </para>

      <para>
	Your design should show a light cyan-colored glass cube with a blue globe
	inside. To eliminate the wireframing, go to Framebuffer (in the Raytrace
	Panel) and select Overlay. The display should appear similar to the
	following illustration:

      <informalfigure>

	  </caption>
	</mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>

      </para>

      <para>
	To make this design more interesting, you can place the globe on a base.
	Do this by going back to Framebuffer and clicking on Active to deactivate
	the framebuffer. Next, go to the Create menu and select the trc
	(truncated right cone) under the Cones and Cylinders category. Name the
	shape base1.s. Working from a Front view, go to the Edit menu and select
	Scale. Click the middle mouse button to reduce the trc in size until the
	bottom of it appears to be an appropriate size for the globe base. (You
	may need to increase the size of your Graphics Window or decrease your
	geometry view size to see the bottom of the trc.) Next, reduce the height
	of the shape by selecting Set H from the Edit menu and clicking with the
	middle mouse button. You may need to switch back and forth between these
	two options a few times to get an acceptable size. When finished, however,
	do not select Accept yet, as we have more changes to make.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="globe_move_rotate"><info><title>Moving and Rotating an Object</title></info>

      <para>
	As with other features in <application>MGED</application>, moving and rotating objects can be
	accomplished in several ways, according to the amount of precision
	desired. As previously described, the Shift Grip functions can be used as
	a quick way to change an object when its exact angle and location do not
	necessarily matter. Alternatively, to achieve greater precision, the
	Translate (move) and Rotate commands under Edit can be selected and
	specific parameter numbers can be entered in the Command Window. In this
	lesson, we will experiment with both methods.
      </para>

      <para>
	With your trc still in edit mode and still in a Front view, use the SHIFT
	key and the left mouse button to drag your shape (the bottom of the base)
	and sit it on the floor of the cube (just touching the inside box). Note
	that you could have selected Translate under Edit and entered parameters
	on the Command Line to move the trc to an exact location; however, in this
	case, aligning the shape with the drag-and-drop "eyeballing" method was
	appropriate. At this point, you may notice that your trc needs to be
	resized a little to better fit the globe. Use Scale and Set H as needed
	and then Accept your changes.
      </para>

      <para>
	Now we need to make a second trc named base2.s, which we will use for the
	top of the base. On the Command Line, type:

	<command>cp base1.s base2.s</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	The second trc will appear directly on top of the first trc, so we will
	have to use Primitive Selection under the edit menu to put base2.s in edit
	mode so that we can flip it upside down and then drag it to the top of the
	first trc.
      </para>

      <para>
	To do this, we could use  the CTRL and ALT (constrained rotation) keys and
	left mouse button and then move the mouse up or down until the trc is
	upside down. (If this method is used, note that you can release the mouse
	button and regrab the object if you need to.) However, because we know we
	want to rotate the shape an exact amount (180'0) about the x axis, let's
	use a more precise method to flip the shape. Select Rotate under Edit and
	then type in the following parameters (abbreviated as p) on the Command
	Line:

	<command>p 180 0 0[Enter]</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	Our shape should have flipped upside down and jumped to the bottom of the
	first trc. (The two zeros you input indicate no rotation along the y and z
	axes.) Now use the SHIFT key and the left mouse button to drag base2.s
	upward and sit it on top of base1.s. The two shapes should form a base in
	which to hold your globe. Check your alignment using multiple views and
	then Accept your changes.
      </para>

      <para>
	Go to Edit and Primitive Selection and select
	globe1.r/globe1.s. As you did with the trc shapes, use the
	Shift Grips to drag the globe down until it is in place on the
	base. Go back to the Edit menu and select Accept. Your design
	should look as follows:

    <section xml:id="globe_use_color_tool"><info><title>Use the Color Tool of the Combination Editor to Produce Customized
      Colors.</title></info>


      <para>
	In the Combination Editor window, click the button  to the right of the
	Name entry box and then Select From All. Choose base1.r. Assign the base a
	Shader of plastic. In the Color box, enter the numbers:

	<command>217 217 217</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	Apply your changes. Before you can raytrace your completed design, you
	must first clear the Graphics Window and rebuild your design by typing at
	the Command Window prompt:

	<command>Z[Enter]</command>

	<command>draw cube1.r globe1.r base1.r[Enter]</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	Change your view to az35, el25 and then raytrace your design, which should
	appear similar to the following:
