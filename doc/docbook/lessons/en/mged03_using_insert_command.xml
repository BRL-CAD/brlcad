      This lesson focuses on creating shapes from the Command Window using the
      make and in commands. You will create a sphere (sph) and a right circular
      cylinder (rcc) using both commands so that you can see how each command
      works. Later in the lesson, you will practice viewing your model from
      different angles.

	Using the make command is a fast and easy way to create a shape; however,
	most models are going to require shapes that have specific parameters,
	such as height and radius. So, a more precise way to create these shapes
	is to use the in (insert) command.

      <para>
	Begin by making the Command Window active (usually done by clicking
	anywhere in the window). Then, use the Z (zap) command to clear the
	Graphics Window.  You are now ready to create a sphere using the in
	command. At the <application>MGED</application> prompt type:
	
	<command>in sph2.s sph[Enter]</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	<application>MGED</application> will respond with:
	
	<literal>Enter X, Y, Z of vertex:</literal>
      </para>
      
      <para>
	You must tell <application>MGED</application> where to position the vertex (center) of your sphere in
	space. Type at the <application>MGED</application> prompt:
	
	<command>4 4 4[Enter]</command>
      </para>
      
      <note>
	<para>
	  As you work in <application>MGED</application>, you will often be asked to enter a value for a   
	  vector or a vertex. In <application>MGED</application>, a vector represents the distance and     
	  direction from one point in space to another, and a vertex is one     
	  single point in space. The values entered for a vector are typically  
	  used to create an object with specific dimensions. The values entered 
	  for a vertex place the object in space.
	</para>
      </note>
      
      <para>
	Your sphere will now be placed at (x,y,z)=(4,4,4), as measured in
	millimeters. Notice that the numbers are separated by spaces followed by
	the ENTER key. <application>MGED</application> will now ask you to:
      </para>  
      <literallayout class="normal">
      <prompt>Enter radius:</prompt>
      
      Type in:
      
      <command>3[Enter]</command>
      </literallayout>
    
      <para>
	The radius of your sphere will be 3 mm. The following is the dialog that
	should appear in your Command Window (including the appropriate
	responses).
	
	<command><prompt>mged&gt;</prompt> in sph2.s sph</command>
	
	<literal>Enter X, Y, Z of vertex: 4 4 4</literal>
	
	<literal>Enter radius: 3</literal>
	
	<literal>51 vectors in 0.000543 sec</literal>
	
	The last line of this dialog is simply a record of the computer's speed in
	drawing the shape. It has no real usefulness to the user at this point.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	A sphere has now been created, and a wireframe drawing similar to the one
	created using the make command should appear in your Graphics Window.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	To make the right circular cylinder, type at the Command Window prompt:
	
	<command>in rcc2.s rcc[Enter]</command>
	
	<application>MGED</application> will ask you to enter values for x, y, and z of the vertex (where you
	want the center of one end of the rcc placed in space). Type:
	
	<command>4 4 0[Enter]</command>
	
	Be sure to leave spaces between each of these numbers.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	<application>MGED</application> will now ask you to enter the x, y, and z values of the height (H)
	vector (i.e., how long you want the rcc to be). Type:
	
	<command>0 0 4[Enter]</command>
	
	The last value you will need to enter is the radius of the rcc. Type:
	
	<command>3[Enter]</command>
	
	The dialog in the Command Window for the creation of the rcc should look
	like this:
      </para>
      
      <literallayout class="normal">
      <prompt>mged&gt;</prompt> in rcc2.s rcc
      
      Enter X, Y, Z of vertex: 4 4 0
      
      Enter X, Y, Z of height (H) vector: 0 0 4
      
      Enter radius: 3
      
      42 vectors in 0.000214 sec
      </literallayout>
    
      <para>
	You should now have new versions of the sphere and rcc shapes. Notice how
	these two shapes compare in size to the first two you created. The rcc is
	now in proportion to the sphere and is placed in space off to the left in
	your Graphics Window. By specifying the dimensions of the shapes and their
	locations in space, you were able to create the model more precisely.

	Another way to use the in command is to combine all of the required
	information on one line. Once you become familiar with using the in
	command, you will probably prefer to use this method as it allows you to

      <para>
	You may have noticed that each time you have created a sphere, or rcc, you
	have given it a different name. <application>MGED</application> doesn't care what name you give a
	shape, but you will find as you develop models that it helps to have some
	formula, or conventions, when naming shapes. Note also that each name must
	be unique in the database, and for <application>BRL-CAD</application> releases prior to 6.0, names
	are limited to 16 characters in length.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	In this lesson, we sometimes assigned names to the shapes based on their
	shape type and the order in which we created them. We did this because the
	shapes had no real function, except to be examples.
      </para>

      <para>
	When you create real-life models, however, you will probably want to
	assign names as we did for the radio component names, which were based on
	their functions (e.g., btn for button, ant for antenna, etc.).
      </para>
      
      <para>
	If you work with more experienced modelers, check with them to see what
	set of conventions they use. If you work alone, develop a set of naming
	conventions that works for you and then use it consistently.
