      <title>Assigning Material Properties to the Mug Using the <command>mater</command> Command</title>
      <para>
	Assigning material properties to a region can be done with either the
	mater or shader command. The program will respond with a series of
	questions. These concern the various parameters of the shader you select
	to use in rendering the object.
      </para>
      <para>
	The most commonly used shader is the plastic shader, which uses a Phong
	lighting model. Select the plastic shader and set the color to a medium
	shade of green. The dialog in the Command Window should appear as follows:
	
	<command><prompt>mged></prompt> mater mug.r[Enter]</command>
      </para>
      
      <literallayout>
   Shader =

   Shader? ('del' to delete, CR to skip) plastic[Enter]

   Color = (No color specified)

   Color R G B (0..255)? ('del' to delete, CR to skip)

	Open the Raytrace Control Panel and select Raytrace. You should get an
	image of a green mug on a dark background (we use a white background here
	to save printing ink). If your mug is not green, you probably need to
	redraw your wireframe before raytracing.

	Now let's improve the cup. Notice that the lip of the cup looks a little
	too squared off. To fix this, you will need to add a rounded top to the
	lip. You can do this by positioning a circular torus shape exactly at the
	top of the cup. Then you can add it to the combination body.c.

    <sect1 id="mug_torus_cup_combine">
      <title>Combining the Shapes</title>
      <para>
	To combine the torus with the cup, you will need to type at the prompt:
	
	<command>comb body.c u rim.s[Enter]</command>
      </para>
      <para>
	Now you are faced with a unique situation. The shape rim.s was added to
	the list of objects being displayed when it was created. However, now it
	is also a part of mug.r (via body.c). If you raytrace the current view,
	you will have two copies of this shape. The raytracer will complain that
	they overlap.
      </para>
      <para>
	One way to fix this is to clear the display, redisplay the new, complete
	object, and then raytrace. As discussed previously, the fbclear  command
	in the Raytrace Control Panel clears the framebuffer display, and the Z
	command in the Command Window clears all wireframed objects. You can
	redisplay the objects you want to raytrace with the draw command. Type at
	the prompt:
	
	<command>Z[Enter]</command>
	
	<command>draw mug.r[Enter]</command>
      </para>
      <para>
	Raytrace your mug. It should now look similar to the following.
