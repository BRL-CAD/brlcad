      In this lesson, you will add material properties to the goblet you created
      in the previous lesson. The finished goblet should appear similar to the
      one in the following example.

    <section xml:id="goblet_review_opening_db"><info><title>Review of Opening an Existing Database</title></info>


      <para>
	If you exited after the last lesson, open your goblet database (goblet.g)
	again. The easiest way to do this is to open the database from the
	Terminal Window when first starting <application>MGED</application>. To do this, type at the prompt:

	<command>mged goblet.g[Enter]</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	Alternatively, you could start the <application>MGED</application> program, and select File from the
	menu bar and then Open. A dialog box will appear and ask you to enter an
	existing database name. Type in goblet.g (or select it in the directory
	listing) and then select Open. The program should tell you that the
	database was successfully opened and it is using millimeters for its unit
	of measure. Click on OK.
      </para>

      <section xml:id="Drawing_Goblet_Graphics"><info><title>Drawing the Goblet in the Graphics Window</title></info>


	<para>
	  To draw the goblet you made in the previous lesson, move the mouse pointer
	  to the Command Window and type at the prompt:

	  <command>draw goblet1.c[Enter]</command>
	</para>

	<para>
	  A wireframe representation of the goblet should appear in the Graphics
	  Window.
	</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="goblet_assign_colors"><info><title>Assigning Colors and the Plastic Shader to Regions of the Goblet</title></info>

      <para>
	Go to the Edit menu and select Combination Editor. To select the various
	regions of the goblet you made in the last lesson, go back to the Name box
	and click the button to the right of the entry box. A submenu will
	appear. Double click on Select From All Regions. A list of regions created
	for this database will appear, including base1.r, basin1.r, and stem1.r.
	double click on base1.r to select that region.
      </para>

      <para>
	Click on the button to the right of Color in the Combination
	Editor, and a drop-down menu will appear with a list of
	available colors along with a color tool that will let you
	create more colors. Click on blue. Next, click the button to
	the right of the shader box. A list of available shaders will
	appear. Click on plastic. A new set of options will appear.
	You will use two of these options in this lesson. Click on
	Apply to assign the color blue and the plastic shader to the
	goblet base.
      </para>

      <para>
	Repeat this process to assign the color green and plastic shader to the
	stem1.r region and the color yellow and plastic shader to the basin1.r
	region. When you are finished, select OK to dismiss the Combination
	Editor box.
      </para>

      <para>
	Although the changes have been made to the database, the display in the
	Graphics Window doesn't reflect them yet. So, return the mouse pointer to
	the Command Window and type at the prompt:

	<command>B goblet1.c[Enter]</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	This command clears the screen and redraws the goblet with the color
	selections applied.
      </para>

      <section xml:id="Raytracing"><info><title>Raytracing the Goblet</title></info>

	<para>
	  To raytrace the goblet, go to the File menu and select Raytrace. The
	  Raytrace Control Panel will appear. Move your mouse pointer to the button
	  to the right of Background Color and select the white option. To make
	  the raytracing go faster, you can resize the Graphics Window to make it
	  smaller before you open the raytrace panel. When the window is resized,
	  select Raytrace to start the raytrace process.
	</para>

	<note>
	  <para>
	    Note: As mentioned previously, it is undesirable to have regions that
	    overlap. Although having overlaps may not always affect the
	    raytracing process, if the model were going to be statistically
	    analyzed, overlaps would create problems.
	  </para>
	</note>

	<para>
	  While the goblet is raytracing, move your mouse cursor to the Framebuffer
	  option of the Raytrace Control Panel menu bar and select Overlay. When
	  the raytrace process is finished, you should have a goblet similar to the
	  following example:

      <informalfigure>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject role="html">
	    <imagedata align="center" fileref="../../lessons/images/mged07_goblet_complete_window.png" format="PNG"/>
	  </imageobject>
	  <imageobject role="fo">
	    <imagedata align="center" fileref="../../lessons/images/mged07_goblet_complete_window.png" format="PNG"/>
	  </imageobject>
	  <caption>
	    <para>
	      The Raytraced Goblet
	    </para>
	  </caption>
	</mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>

	</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="goblet_transparency_mirror"><info><title>Using the Transparency and Mirror Reflectance Shader Options</title></info>

      <para>
	The raytraced goblet looks fairly realistic, but it could be enhanced by
	using other options of the Combination Editor. When you selected the
	plastic shader, a new set of options appeared, allowing you to choose
	various properties or attributes of the shader. Among the options was
	Transparency. You can adjust this property on individual regions by
	entering any value between 0.0  (opaque) and 1.0 (transparent).
      </para>

      <para>
	Just as you applied color and a shader to each of the goblet's three
	regions, you can adjust the transparency of each region by (1) selecting
	the region in the Combination Editor, (2) left clicking on the box next to
	Transparency, and (3) entering any value between 0.0 and 1.0.
      </para>

      <para>
	For this lesson, open the Combination Editor, click the button to the
	right of the Name box, choose Select From All Regions in the drop-down
	menu, and then choose the base1.r region. Make sure plastic is the shader
	selected and type in .5 to make your region semi-transparent. Click on
	Apply and repeat this process for each of the other two regions. Then
	Raytrace the goblet, which should look similar to the following:

      <informalfigure>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject role="html">
	    <imagedata align="center" fileref="../../lessons/images/mged07_goblet_semitransparent.png" format="PNG"/>
	  </imageobject>
	  <imageobject role="fo">
	    <imagedata align="center" fileref="../../lessons/images/mged07_goblet_semitransparent.png" format="PNG"/>
	  </imageobject>
	  <caption>
	    <para>
	      The Semi-Transparent Raytraced Goblet
	    </para>
	  </caption>
	</mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>

      </para>

      <para>
	The colors of the semi-transparent goblet are brighter than those of the
	opaque goblet because more light is allowed to penetrate the plastic
	material. You could make the goblet more realistic in appearance by
	returning to the Combination Editor and adding a Mirror Reflectance. For
	each region, place your mouse cursor in the box next to this option, click
	the left mouse button, and type in .45. This will cause about half of the
	available light to be reflected off the surface of the goblet.
      </para>

    <section xml:id="goblet_newforms_raytrace"><info><title>Raytracing the New Forms of the Goblet</title></info>


      <para>
	Click on Apply and Raytrace the design. The new image should appear
	similar to the following example:

      <informalfigure>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject role="html">
	    <imagedata align="center" fileref="../../lessons/images/mged07_goblet_mirror.png" format="PNG"/>

	      The Raytraced Goblet with Mirror Reflectance Added
	    </para>
	  </caption>
	</mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>

      </para>

      <para>
	The new image is substantially different in appearance from the original
	image. Continue changing the values of transparency and mirror reflectance
	to see how they impact the resulting image.
      </para>

      <para>
	Remember that when using these options, the combined value of both options
	should be less than 1.0. The following table shows you just some of the
	many possible combinations you could use:
      </para>
