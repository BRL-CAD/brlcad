      <para>
	First, start <application>MGED</application> from the shell prompt. Select File from the menu bar and
	then New. A dialog box will appear, and it will ask you for a new database
	name. Type in goblet.g at the end of the path name and select OK to
	create the new database. The program should tell you that the database was
	successfully created and it is using millimeters for its unit of measure.

	<para>
	  Go to the menu bar, select the Cones and Cylinders category, and then select
	  rcc for right circular cylinder. A dialog box will appear asking you to
	  name the rcc. Type in base1.s and then select Apply (or press ENTER). A
	  tall cylinder will appear in the Graphics Window that is ready for you to
	  edit.

	<para>
	  Go to the menu bar and select Edit and then Set H. Place the
	  mouse pointer in the lower half of the Graphics Window and
	  click on the middle mouse button several times. The cylinder
	  will become shorter as you click. (Note that the closer your
	  pointer is to the midpoint of the Graphics Window, the
	  smaller the change will be. As you click farther away from
	  the middle, the changes will be greater.) Continue clicking
	  until the cylinder looks like a flat disk, as shown in the
	  following figure. Click on Accept on the Edit menu when
	  done.

	<para>
	  Go to the menu bar, select Create, select Ellipsoids, and then select
	  sph to create a sphere. You will be asked to provide a name for the
	  sphere. Type ball1.s in the name box and then select Apply. A large
	  sphere will appear in your Graphics Window.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Go to the Edit menu and select Scale. Place the mouse cursor/pointer in
	  the lower half of the Graphics Window and click the middle mouse button
	  until your sphere is about one-quarter the diameter of the base, as shown
	  in the illustration that follows.

	<para>
	  To move the ball on top of the goblet base, press the SHIFT
	  key and left mouse button to drag the sphere into place. You
	  can check your placement by going to the View option of the
	  menu bar and selecting a Front view. In this view, you can
	  align the center line of the sphere with the center line of
	  the rcc. Repeat this process from a Left view. When you
	  believe the sphere is correctly aligned with the rcc, go
	  back to the Edit menu and select Accept.
	</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="Adding_Additional_Balls"><info><title>Adding Additional Balls to the Goblet Stem</title></info>


	<para>
	  The next step is to add more spheres to your goblet stem. An easy way to
	  do this is to go to the Edit menu and select Primitive Editor. A dialog
	  box will appear. Enter the name for the first sphere you created, ball1.s.
	  Next, select Reset (to reset the values of the dialog box to those of
	  ball1.s) or hit return in the Name box. Again in the Name box, change
	  ball1.s to ball2.s by using the BACKSPACE key to erase the 1. Type in a 2
	  and then select Apply.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Repeat this process with an sph named ball3.s. When you are done, select
	  OK to close the Primitive Editor box. You now have three balls for your
	  stem, but you won't be able to see them until you edit them because they
	  are in the same place.
	</para>

	<para>
	  An even easier way to make the copies is to use the cp (copy) command as
	  follows:

	  <command>cp ball1.s ball2.s[Enter]</command>

	  <command>cp ball1.s ball3.s[Enter]</command>
	</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="Editing_the_base_Goblet"><info><title>Editing the Balls of the Goblet Stem</title></info>


	<para>
	  To edit the new balls you have created, go to the Edit menu and select
	  Primitive Selection. A box will appear with the names of your base and
	  balls. Double click on ball2.s to select it. You will see the first ball
	  change color to white. Use the SHIFT key and any mouse button to drag this
	  ball (which is really ball2.s) so that it rests on top of (and slightly
	  overlaps) ball1.s . Check your views to align the ball as you did with the
	  first ball. (Note that this alignment is even easier if you drag using the
	  SHIFT and ALT keys and the right mouse button, which will constrain the
	  movement of the ball to the Z direction.) Click on Accept under the Edit
	  menu when finished.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If you were modeling a real goblet, you would want the balls of the stem
	  to overlap slightly. If they barely touch, the stem would be very weak. If
	  they do not touch, then the stem would be made of separate pieces of
	  material suspended in space.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Repeat these steps to move ball3.s into position. When you are finished,
	  your goblet should look as follows from a front view:

      <section xml:id="making_goblet_Basin"><info><title>Making the Goblet Basin</title></info>

	<para>
	  The next step is to make the goblet's basin. Go to the Create menu and
	  select eto to create an elliptical torus. Name the torus basin1.s. Click
	  on Apply. A large eto will appear in your Graphics Window.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Go to the Edit menu and select Set C. Place the mouse arrow in the upper
	  half of the Graphics Window and click on the middle mouse button until
	  your eto is approximately the size of the one in the following figure. If
	  you need to, use Scale to make the basin more proportional to the rest
	  object and use the Shift Grips and multiple views to position the basin.

      <para>
	In order for <application>MGED</application> to know what primitives to raytrace, you must first
	designate these areas through Boolean operations. In this example, the two
	Boolean operations used will be the union (u) and the subtraction (-).
      </para>

      <para>
	To make the stem a region, type at the Command Window prompt:

	<command>r stem1.r u ball1.s u ball2.s u ball3.s[Enter]</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	To make the base a region, type at the prompt:

	<command>r base1.r u base1.s - ball1.s[Enter]</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	To make the basin a region, type at the prompt:

	<command>r basin1.r u basin1.s - stem1.r[Enter]</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	Note that when creating base1.r, we subtracted a primitive shape from
	another primitive shape. When creating basin1.r, we subtracted an entire
	region from a primitive shape.

    <section xml:id="making_goblet_region_comb"><info><title>Making a Combination of the Regions</title></info>

      <para>
	To combine all the regions into one object, you will need to perform one
	last Boolean operation. At the prompt in the Command Window, type:

	<command>comb goblet1.c u basin1.r u stem1.r u base1.r[Enter]</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	This operation tells the <application>MGED</application> program to:

    <section xml:id="goblet_view_data_tree"><info><title>Viewing a Data Tree</title></info>

      <para>
	<application>MGED</application> requires a certain logical order to the model data tree so it knows
	how to raytrace the various elements. In the goblet, the base and basin
	consist of regions composed of only one primitive shape each. The stem, in
	contrast, consists of a region composed of the union of three spheres. The
	three regions were combined to form a complex object.
      </para>

      <para>
	To view the data tree for this combination, type at the Command Window
	prompt:

	<command>tree goblet1.c[Enter]</command>
      </para>

      <para>
	<application>MGED</application> will respond with:
	<literallayout class="normal">
   goblet1.c/

   u basin1.s

   - stem1.r/R

   u stem1.r/R

   u ball1.s

   u ball2.s

   u base1.r/R

   u base1.s

   - ball1.s
	</literallayout>
      </para>

      <para>
	The name of the overall combination of this design is goblet1.c. It is
	composed of the three regions: base1.r, stem1.r, and basin1.r. The region
	base1.r is composed of the primitive shape named base1.s minus ball1.s.
	The region stem1.r is composed of three primitive shapes named ball1.s,
	ball2.s, and ball3.s. The region basin1.r is composed of the primitive
	shape named basin1.s minus the region  stem1.r.
      </para>

      <para>
	Remember that regions define volumes of uniform material. In the real
	world (and in <application>BRL-CAD</application>), no two objects can occupy the same space. If two
	regions occupy the same space, they are said to overlap. To avoid having
	the base and stem overlap, we subtract ball1.s from base1.s  when we
	create base1.r. We also subtract the stem1.r from basin1.s when we create
	basin1.r. This removes material from one region that would otherwise
	create an overlap with another. The following figure shows the overlap
	between ball1.s and base1.s in blue. This is the volume that is removed
	from base1.r.
