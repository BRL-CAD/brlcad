Tcl (Tool Command Language) is an interpreted language that is embeddable and highly extensible. Tk (ToolKit) is a toolkit for developing user interfaces for desktop applications not only for Tcl, but for many other languages that run across various operating systems including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux etc. Hence when combined, both create a programming framework that can be used for development and use of GUI applications.
