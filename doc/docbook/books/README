The books subdirectory contains DocBook files intended to serve as
both individual books with new content and agglomerations of individual
files into larger collections.

tutorial_series/
	This directory contains the re-formatted contents of the BRL-CAD
	Tutorial Series Volumes II and III.  The reformatting has also
	involved updates and fixes - the results of these files are not
	claimed to be exact replicas of the original pdf files.  
	
	In the case of Volume II the individual lessons have been organized
	into individual DocBook files in ../lessons/en and are included
	from that directory into BRL-CAD_Tutorial_Series_VolumeII.xml.  
	By and large, any editing of lesson contents should occur in the 
	individual files - editing of VolumeII.xml is needed only if lessons 
	are to be added, renamed or removed.  Eventually, it is intended 
	that the appendix of system commands present in the original 
	Volume II be replaced with direct inclusion of the command 
	documentation from system/man1 files.
	
	BRL-CAD_Tutorial_Series_VolumeIII.xml retains most of its content 
	within the file itself, but the appendices detailing specific 
	advanced features have been broken out into individual files 
	in articles - note that not all of the articals in the articles 
	directory were present in the original Volume III.
