    <para>
	Since the late 1950s, computers have been used to assist with the design
	and study of combat vehicle systems. The result has been a reduction in the
	amount of time and money required to take a system from the drawing board to
	full-scale production as well as increased efficiency in testing and evaluation.
    </para>
    <para>
	In 1979, the U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) (now the U.S. Army
	Research Laboratory [ARL]) expressed a need for tools that could assist with the
	computer simulation and engineering analysis of combat vehicle systems and environments.
	When no existing computer-aided design (CAD) package was found to be adequate for this
	purpose, BRL software developers began assembling a suite of utilities capable of
	interactively displaying, editing, and interrogating geometric models. This suite
	became known as BRL-CAD.
    </para>
    <para>
	Now comprising almost a million lines of C code, BRL-CAD has become a powerful
	constructive solid geometry (CSG) modeling package that has been licensed at over
	2,000 sites throughout the world. It contains a large collection of tools, utilities,
	and libraries including an interactive geometry editor, raytracing and generic framebuffer
	libraries, a network-distributed image-processing and signal-processing capability, and a
	customizable embedded scripting language. In addition, BRL-CAD simultaneously supports
	dual interaction methods, one using a command line and one using a graphical user
	interface (GUI).
    </para>
    <para>
	A particular strength of the package lies in its ability to build and analyze realistic
	models of complex objects using a relatively small set of "primitive shapes." To do
	this, the shapes are manipulated by employing the basic Boolean operations of union,
	subtraction, and intersection. Another strength of the package is the speed of its
	raytracer, which is one of the fastest in existence. Finally, BRL-CAD users can accurately
	model objects on scales ranging from the subatomic through the galactic and get "all the
	details, all the time."
    </para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter xml:id="whycsg"><info><title>Why CSG Modeling?</title></info>

    <para>
	Although BRL-CAD has been used for a wide variety of engineering and graphics
	applications, the package's primary purpose continues to be the support of (1) ballistic
	and (2) electromagnetic analyses. Accordingly, developers have found CSG modeling to be
	the best approach in terms of model accuracy, storage efficiency, precision, and speed
	of computational analysis.
    </para>
    <para>
	While polygonal and boundary representation (B-rep) modeling often focuses on just
	the surfaces of objects, CSG modeling focuses on the entire volume and content of objects.
	This gives BRL-CAD the capability to be "more than skin deep" and build objects with
	real-world materials, densities, and thicknesses so that analysts can study physical
	phenomena such as ballistic penetration and thermal, radiative, neutron, and other
	types of transport.
    </para>

  <chapter xml:id="packagecontent"><info><title>Package Content</title></info>

     <para>
	In keeping with the UNIX philosophy of developing independent tools to perform single,
	specific tasks and then linking the tools together in a package, BRL-CAD is basically a
	collection of libraries, tools, and utilities that work together to create, raytrace,
	and interrogate geometry and manipulate files and data. The basic data flow structure
	of the package is illustrated below.

  <chapter xml:id="libraries"><info><title>Libraries</title></info>

    <para>
	The BRL-CAD libraries (designated by the prefix "lib") are designed primarily for the
	geometric modeler who also wants to tinker with software and, perhaps, design custom tools.
	Each library fits into one of three categories: (1) creating and/or editing geometry,
	(2) raytracing geometry, or (3) image handling. The following is a list of the major BRL-CAD
	libraries and descriptions of their functions.

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    	libbu - a basic utility (bu) library containing fundamental computer science types of routines, including manipulating data (e.g., converting from host format data to network format data), parallel processing, parsing parameters, handling variable-length strings, performing error checks, converting units from one format to another, manipulating bit vectors, running parallel-safe versions of input/output (I/O) routines, and maintaining symbol tables.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    	libbn - a library of routines to support basic numerical (bn) handling, including 2-D/3-D vector, matrix, and quaternion manipulation; 3-D plotting support; automatic inference of image size (BRL-CAD images have no internal header; image dimensions are intuited from the size of the file); and wavelet decomposition and reconstruction, etc.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
		libdm - BRL-CAD's primary graphics display manager (dm) library. It handles opening windows onto the display and displaying geometry in the graphics window, etc.

  <chapter xml:id="benchmarkingimages"><info><title>Benchmark Testing</title></info>

	<para>
	   As changes are implemented in BRL-CAD, ARL developers run a standard set of
	   computationally intensive image files (shown in Figure 2) on a common machine
	   in order to benchmark and compare raytrace performance. In addition, these images
	   are provided with each source distribution of the package so that users can also
	   test performance on their machines, if desired.
	</para>
	<para>
	   To run the benchmark images, run the script run.sh in the "bench" directory of the source directory tree.
