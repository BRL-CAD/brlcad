			In BRL-CAD objects are constructed using a technique known as ``Combinatorial Solid Geometry'' or ``Constructive Solid Geometry'' or simply ``CSG'' In the CSG approach to modeling This technique involves creating objects by combining primitive shapes together to form complex objects.  The primitive shapes are called ``solids''.  Each one occupies a volume of three dimensional space.  BRL-CAD currently has many primitive solid types.  These include:

	These primitives can be combined using boolean operators to create complex shapes.  The three boolean operations supported are union, difference (or subtraction), and intersection.  Any number of primitives may be combined to produce a shape.  The union (u) of two solids is defined as the volume in either of the solids.  The difference (-) of two solids is the volume of the first solid which is not in the volume of the second solid.  The intersection (+) of two solids is the volume that is contained in both solids.

<para>
	The result of performing a set of boolean operations is a new shape.  In BRL-CAD this new shape is known as a ``combination''.  This is frequently abbreviated as ``comb''.  A ``comb'' can be further combined with other shapes to create still more complex shapes.  For example, the shape of a simple cup might be created by subtracting a cylinder from a slightly larger cylinder.  From this ``comb'' shape, the shape of a mug could be created by adding a handle.  The handle might be composed of an elliptical torus with the part of the torus that would be inside the cup removed.  Logically this is:

<programlisting>
Cup = Outside - Inside

Handle = Ring - Outside

Mug = Cup union Handle
</programlisting>
</para>

      </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
    </figure>
  </para>
<para>
In this way the shape of objects are built up from components.
</para>
<para>
When the desired shape of an object is attained, a special combination called a ``region'' is created.  A ``region'' represents an actual material component of the model.  It represents an item which is made from a homogeneous type of material.  In the example above two combinations are created: Cup and Handle.  These two are brought together to form an object (Mug) which is made of a single material (such as ceramic or bone china).  Material properties such as color, texture, transparency, reflectivity, etc. are assigned to regions.
</para>
<para>
The model is built up as a tree-like structure known as a Directed Acyclic Graph or DAG.  It is permissible for a node to be referenced by different parts of the model.  In the mug example, the solid "Outside" is a part of two different combinations: Cup and Handle.  In this example the graph of the mug object looks like this:
<programlisting>
			  Torus
			 /
		Handle (-)
	       /	 \
	Mug (u)		  Cylinder
	       \	 /
		Cup -- (-)
			 \
			  Insides
</programlisting>
It is possible to refer to combinations and regions multiple times as well.  For example, if a modeler were trying to create a cupboard containing three separate identical mugs, he might create a structure as follows:
<programlisting>
	 Mug 1			    Ring
        /     \			   /
       /       \	 Handle (-)
     (u)        \       /	   \
Mugs (u)- Mug 2--Mug (u)	    Outside
     (u)        /       \	   /
       \       /	 Cup -- (-)
        \     /			   \
	 Mug 3			    Inside
</programlisting>
Users familiar with other CAD software may prefer to think of the ``region'' as a ``part''.  Combinations containing of ``regions'' may be thought of as ``assemblies''.

<para>
	The program for editing BRL-CAD geometry is called ``mged''.
</para>
<para>
All the geometry for a particular model or application is generally stored in a single file called a database.  Each database may contain many different objects.  By convention, the files containing BRL-CAD geometry have an extension of ``.g''.
</para>
<para>
Before starting mged the user should assure that the X-Windows DISPLAY environment variable has been properly set.  This indicates where applications should display the windows they create.
</para>
<para>
We use the following conventions for denoting text:
<programlisting>
	Text typed by the user
	Text output by the program
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
To edit or create a geometry file, the user starts the mged program from the shell by giving the command:
<programlisting>
   % mged -c cup.g
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
The filename is required.  Unlike many programs which allow the user to create a new document or database in memory, mged always keeps everything on disk.  After each user command, the contents of the disk file are brought up to date.  By doing this, the amount of work lost in the event of a system crash is minimized.
</para>
<para>
When mged is started, it prints out the release number and date of compilation. When multiple versions of mged are installed on a machine, this allows the user to verify that the proper version is being started.
</para>
<para>
If the file specified does not exist when mged is started, it will stop and ask if the user wishes to create a new database:
<programlisting>
   % mged -c cup.g

       bparker@vapor.arl.mil:/m/cad/.mged.6d

   cup.g: No such file or directory
   Create new database (y|n)[n]?
At this point pressing the ``y'' key followed by a return will create the new database.  Any other (non-y) keys (followed by a return) will cause mged to quit without creating the database.
   % mged -c cup.g

At this point, mged is asking what type of geometry display window you would like.  The default is always ``nu'' for Null or ``no geometry display''.  If you are creating geometry, it is desirable to be able to see it.  The common choices are:

	At this point you should have a window that looks something like this:

  </mediaobject>
    </figure>
  </para>
  <para>
When the MGED program has a display window or device attached, it displays a border around the region of the screen being used along with some ancillary status information.  Together, this information is termed the editor ``faceplate''.
</para>
<para>
In the upper left corner of the window is a small enclosed area which is used to display the current editor state. The current editor state indicates whether objects are selected for editing and what modeling operations are allowed.
</para>
<para>
Underneath the state display is a zone in which three ``pop-up'' menus may appear.  The top menu is termed the ``button menu,'' as it contains menu items which duplicate many functions which were originally available via an external button box peripheral.  Having these frequently used functions available on a pop-up menu can greatly decrease the number of times that the user needs to remove his hand from the pointing device (either mouse or tablet puck) to reach for the buttons.
</para>
<para>
Below is an example of the faceplate and first level menu.
</para>
  <para>
<figure>
	<mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="images/faceplate_menu_sm.gif" width="250" />
      </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
    </figure>
  </para>
  <para>
The second menu is used primarily for the various editing states, at which time it contains all the editing operations which are generic across all objects (scaling, rotation, and translation).  The third menu contains selections for object-specific editing operations.  The choices on these menus are detailed below.
</para>
<para>
Running across the entire bottom of the faceplate is a thin rectangular display area which holds two lines of text.  The first line always contains a numeric display of the model-space coordinates of the center of the view and the current size of the viewing cube, both of which are displayed in the currently selected editing units.  The first line also contains the current rotation rates.
</para>
<para>
The second line has several uses, depending on editor mode.  In various editing states this second line will contain certain path selection information.  When the angle/distance cursor function is activated, the second line will be used to display the current settings of the cursor.
</para>
<para>
All numeric interaction between the user and the editor are in terms of user-selected display units.  The user may select from millimeters, centimeters, meters, inches, and feet, and the currently active display units are noted in the first display line.  One important implementation detail is that all numeric values are stored in the database in millimeters. When MGED interacts with the user, it converts values from the database into the units selected by the user before displaying them.  Likewise, values that the user enters are converted to millimeters before being written to the database.
</para>
</section>
<section xml:id="The_Screen_Coordinate_System">
	<title>
		The Screen Coordinate System
	</title>
	<para>
	Objects drawn on the screen are clipped in X, Y, and Z, to the size indicated on the first status line.  This creates a conceptual ``viewing cube''.  Only objects inside this cube are visible.  This feature allows objects within the cube to be seen, without cluttering the display with objects which are within view in X and Y, but quite far away in the Z direction.  This is especially useful when the display is zoomed in on a small portion of the geometry.  On some displays Z axis clipping can be selectively enabled and disabled as a viewing aid.
</para>
<para>
The MGED editor uses the standard right-handed screen coordinate system shown in the figure below.

    </figure>
</para>
<para>
	The Z axis is perpendicular to the screen and the positive Z direction is out of the screen towards the viewer.  The directions of positive (+) and negative (-) axis rotations are also indicated.  For these rotations, the ``Right Hand Rule'' applies: Point the thumb of the right hand along the direction of +X axis and the other fingers will describe the sense of positive rotation.

The first step in preparing a new database is to provide a title which describes the contents of the database.  This is an important opportunity to describe the contents and purpose of the database.  Setting the title is done with the title command in MGED.
</para>
<para>
	<programlisting>
   mged> Title MGED Tutorial Geometry
</programlisting>
When the database is first created, the default editing units are set to millimeters.  For this example, we want to specify the dimensions of the object in inches.  To arrange this, the units command
<programlisting>
   mged> units in
</programlisting>
Now we can create our first solid.  There are two techniques for creating geometry in MGED.  The commands for these two techniques are make and in (for ``insert'').  For precision modeling the in command offers the greatest control over the definition of the solid.  This is the approach we will use.
</para>
<para>
The ``in'' command can take all of its arguments on the command line, or it will prompt you for any missing portions.  Remembering what parameters need to be specified for each solid can be difficult at best.  All that you really need to enter is the command name.  Mged will prompt you for the rest of the parameters.
</para>
<para>
In the first example above we specify the name of the solid we are creating (``outside.s'') and the type of solid to create (``rcc''). Then mged prompts for the remaining arguments (vertex, height vector, and radius):
<programlisting>
   mged> in outside.s rcc
   Enter X, Y, Z of vertex: 0 0 0
   Enter X, Y, Z of height (H) vector: 0 0 3.5
   Enter radius: 1.75
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
For the solid ``inside.s'' we specify all the parameters on the command line, so mged does not prompt us for additional arguments.  In the case of the solid ``ring.s'' we specify some, but not all of the parameters, and mged prompts us for the missing ones:
<programlisting>
   mged> in inside.s rcc 0 0 0.25 0 0 3.5 1.5
   42 vectors in 0.006435 sec
   mged> in ring.s eto 0 2.5 1.75 1 0 0
   Enter X, Y, Z, of vector C: .6 0 0
   Enter radius of revolution, r: 1.45
   Enter elliptical semi-minor axis, d: 0.2
   2479 vectors in 0.087375 sec
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
As a minimal example, if we wanted to create a sphere called ``ball.s'' we could simply type the ``in'' command and let mged prompt us for everything else:
<programlisting>
   mged> in
   Enter name of solid: ball.s
   Enter solid type:  sph
   Enter X, Y, Z of vertex:  0 0 0
   Enter radius:  3
   51 vectors in 0.117187 sec
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
The three boolean operators supported are union, subtraction and intersection. These operations are denoted by the operators u, - and + respectively.  Mged uses these in a sort of prefix notation.  In this notation the union operator has higher precedence than either subtraction or intersection.  Hence the following boolean sequence
<programlisting>
	(A union B) subtract C

is written as

	u A - C u B - C
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
The comb command creates a boolean combination.  In our example we use this to create the shape of the outside of the cup called ``cup.s'' Reading the command above that creates cup.c, we note that cup.c is formed from the union of the volume defined by the solid ``outside.s'' and the subtraction of the volume defined by the solid ``inside.s''.
</para>
<para>
The r command creates a ``region''.  It is just like creating a combination, but the results are a volume of one logical material type.
</para>
<para>
Assigning material properties is done with the mater or shader command.  Here we define which shader should be used when rendering the object, and the parameters for the shader.  The simplest shader is the ``plastic'' shader which uses a Phong lighting model.  For our mug this will be fine.  We specify the plastic shader and set the color to a shade of green.
<programlisting>

The Inheritance option should be left 0.  This option will be discussed later.
Once we have created our geometry, it would be nice to look at the wireframe from a variety of angles.  By clicking on the button menu box a set of options is displayed.  The buttons labeled "35,25", "Top", "Right", "Front", and "45,45" offer a set of standard views.
</para>
<para>
It is possible to raytrace the current view from within mged.  But to do so we need a place to display the image.  We start up a framebuffer server (number 1) to accommodate this:

 <programlisting>
   mged> exec fbserv 1 /dev/sgip &#38;
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
This runs the ``fbserv'' program which will maintain a framebuffer window for us.  Now we are ready to raytrace an image.  First we'll clear the geometry window of all the primitives and combinations and regions we've created.  Then we display the region we want to raytrace with the ``draw'' command.  Finally, we'll select a nice viewing angle of azimuth 35 elevation 25 with the ``ae'' command.

<programlisting>
   mged> Z
   mged> draw mug.r
   mged> ae 35 25
</programlisting>
Now we are ready to raytrace an image.  The ``rt'' command starts the raytracer on the geometry.  We must tell it where we want the pixels displayed with the ``-F'' option, and the size of the image with the -s option:
<programlisting>
   mged> rt -F:1 -s 512
</programlisting>
The rt program prints a variety of information when it runs:
<programlisting>
rt -F:0 -s 512
rt -s50 -M -F:0 -s 512 cup.g mug.r

Now let's improve on our basic cup.  The lip of this cup looks a little too squared off.  To fix this, we'll add a rounded top to the lip.  To do this we create a circular torus solid positioned at exactly the top of the cup.  Then we can add it to the combination ``cup.c''.
<programlisting>

   mged> in rim.s tor 0 0 3.5 0 0 1 1.625 0.125
   214 vectors in 0.001814 sec
   mged> comb cup.c u rim.s
</programlisting>
Now we have a unique condition.  The solid rim.s was added to the list of objects being displayed when it was created.  However, now it is also a part of mug.r (via cup.c).  If we raytrace the current view we will have 2 copies of this solid.  The raytracer will complain that they overlap.  The best way to fix this is to clear the display, redisplay the new, complete object, and then raytrace.  The ``Z'' command clears all objects from the display. Then we can redisplay the objects we want to raytrace with the ``draw'' command.
<programlisting>
   mged> Z
   mged> draw mug.r
</programlisting>
Since this is a frequent operation (clear the display list and draw something new) there is a shortcut:
<programlisting>
   mged> B mug.r
</programlisting>
The ``B'' is not very easy to remember (one suggested mnemonic is "blast"), but it is quite useful.
Now we are ready to raytrace again.

<para>
So far we've focused on creating primitive solids and combinations.  Now let's look at ways of altering and deleting things that already exist.  We'll continue with our example mug geometry.  There are a number of changes that need to be made to make it more realistic.
</para>
<para>
The handle for the mug is a little awkward.  It sticks out too far from the side of the mug, and it is too wide.
</para>
<para>
The bottom is perfectly flat.  Any imperfection in the table top would cause it to wobble.
The inside bottom corner is too sharp. We need to create a "fillet" at the seam between side and bottom.

      The -c (Classic MGED) option causes MGED to start in the style of
      previous versions of MGED, that is, by prompting the user to
      select a display manager to attach and by remaining attached to
      the tty. Without this option MGED will detach itself from the tty
      and bring up the new GUI. The -d option provides a way to specify
      a display string. This string is expected to be in the same format
      as the X DISPLAY environment variable. The -h option causes the
      help message to print out. The -r option causes the database to be
      read-only (i.e. no editing allowed). The -x and -X options provide
      a way for the user to specify the debug level of librt and libbu,
      respectively. Note that if MGED is started by redirecting stdin or
      stdout, MGED will not enter interactive mode. Similarly, if MGED
      is started with a command, that command will be executed and MGED
      will exit. If the user starts MGED in <quote>’Classic</quote>’
      mode, the new GUI is still available via the
      <link linkend="gui">gui</link> command. There
      can be many instances of the GUI running at the same time. Each
      instance of the GUI owns four display manager windows (panes) and
      by default each of these panes has its view initialized as
      follows:

      All four panes can be displayed simultaneously, or a single large
      pane containing the active pane can be displayed (look in the
      <quote>’Modes</quote><quote>menu). The active pane is the pane
      that is controlled by the GUI. The active pane can be changed from
      the</quote><quote>Settings</quote><quote>menu, or by certain key
      or mouse button actions. Essentially, any key sequence or mouse
      button action that will pop up an MGED menu in the pane will cause
      the active pane to move to the pane wherein this action occurred.
      For example, alt-f will pop up the file menu and make this pane
      the active pane. Similarly, alt-Button1 will pop up
      the</quote><quote>Settings</quote><quote>menu and alt-Button2 will
      pop up the</quote><quote>Modes</quote>’ menu.
    </para>
    <para>
      The new GUI also provides <quote>’Help on Context</quote><quote>.
      This is always available via the right mouse button (i.e. button
      3). The user can right mouse click on some feature of the GUI and
      a message window pops up with information about the feature. This
      behavior works everywhere except in the drawing panes (i.e.
      display manager windows) where a right mouse button is bound
      to</quote><quote>zoom 2.0</quote>’.

    <para>
      There are many new features and improvements in MGED providing
      greater access to its underlying power. The single greatest
      improvement to MGED is the incorporation of Tcl/Tk. Tcl (tool
      command language) is an interpreted command language that can be
      embedded into an application providing the application with an
      interpreter as well as a built-in command language. Tk is an
      extension to Tcl for building GUI’s. Incorporating Tcl/Tk into
      MGED gives the user the ability to develop their own commands and
      GUI’s. Other new features are: command line editing similar to
      tcsh, multiple display managers opened simultaneously, shareable
      resources among display managers, view axes, model axes, edit
      axes, rubber banding for zoom or raytracing, support for color
      schemes, frame buffer support for display managers, snap to grid
      for accuracy with the mouse, query rays for interrogating the
      geometry, and improved solid/object/combination selection from
      among displayed geometry.

  <section xml:id="CommandWindow">
    <title>Command Window</title>
    <para>
      The main function of the command window is to allow the user to
      enter commands. The command window supports
      <link linkend="cmd_line_ed">command line editing</link> and
      command history. The two supported command line edit modes are
      emacs and vi. Look under File/ Preferences/Command_Line_Edit to
      change the edit mode.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are also two command interpretation modes. One is where MGED
      performs object name matching (i.e. globbing against the database)
      before passing the command line to MGED’s built-in Tcl
      interpreter. This is the same behavior seen in previous releases.
      The other command interpretation mode (Tcl Evaluation) passes the
      command line directly to the Tcl interpreter. Look under
      File/Preferences/ Special_Characters to change the interpretation
      mode.
    </para>
    <para>
      The command window also supports cut and paste as well as text
      scrolling. The default bindings for these operations are similar
      to those found in typical X Window applications such as xterm. For
      example:

				it uses the modifier keys: Shift, Control, and Alt.
        This use of modified mouse clicks to grab things is called the
        <quote>shift-grip</quote> interface. The Shift and Control keys
        are assigned in combinations to the three basic transformation
        operations as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
        Modifier Key

      </para>
      <para>
 and the Alt key is assigned the meaning
        <quote>constrained transformation,</quote> which is described
        below. Thus, in general, holding the Shift key and a mouse
        button down and moving the mouse drags things around on the
        screen. The Control key and a mouse button allow one to rotate
        things, and the combination of Shift, Control, and a mouse
        button allow one to expand and contract things. These general
        functionalities are consistent throughout MGED, providing a
        unified interface. The precise meanings of <quote>drag things
        around,</quote> <quote>rotate things,</quote> and <quote>expand
        and contract things</quote> depends on the operating context.
      </para>
      <para>
        When one is merely viewing geometry the shift grips apply by
        default to the view itself. Thus they amount to panning,
        rotating, and zooming the eye relative to the geometry being
        displayed. When one is in solid-edit or matrix-edit mode (what
        used to be called object-edit mode), the shift grips apply by
        default to the model parameters. In this case, they modify the
        location, orientation, or size of object features or entire
        objects in the database.
      </para>
      <para>
        The default behaviors in the viewing and editing modes may be
        overridden by the <quote>Transform</quote> item in the
        <quote>Settings</quote> menu. This allows the user to specify
        that the shift grips should transform the view, the model
        parameters (if one is currently editing a solid or matrix) or
        the angle-distance cursor (in which case the mouse may be used
        to position the ADC, to change its angles, and to expand and
        contract its distance ticks). The behavior of the shift grips
        may be further changed by the <quote>Rotate About</quote> item
        in the <quote>Settings</quote> menu, which allows the user to
        specify the point about which shift-grip rotations should be
        performed. The choices include the view center, the eye, the
        model origin, and an object’s key point.

 Thus, if the view is being transformed,
          Alt-Shift-Button-1 allows one to drag the objects being viewed
          left to right along the view-x axis. Similarly, if the model
          parameters are being transformed, Alt-Ctrl-Button-2 allows one
          to rotate the object about a line passing through the
          rotate-about point (as described above) and parallel to a
          y-axis. The coordinate system to which these transformations
          are constrained may be specified by the <quote>Constraint
          Coords</quote> item in the <quote>Settings</quote> menu, which
          allows the selection of any one of the model, view, and object
          coordinate systems.

                  If more than one solid is hit, a listbox of the hit
                  solids is presented. The user then selects a solid

                  the user selects a path component. This component
                  determines which matrix will be edited. After
                  selecting the path component, object/matrix edit mode
                  is entered. When this happens, the mouse behavior mode

              display managers. When using display lists the screen

              noticeable when running MGED remotely. Use of display
              lists is encouraged unless the geometry being viewed is
              bigger than the Ogl server can handle (i.e. the server
              runs out of available memory for storing display lists).
              When this happens the machine will begin to swap (and
              little else). If huge pieces of geometry need to be
              viewed, consider toggling off display lists. Note that
              using display lists while viewing geometry of any
              significant size will incur noticeable compute time up
              front to create the display lists.

          prompt for the shell, and the user may perform any legal shell

          shell process to finish, which occurs when the user exits the

        <para>
          Build an <link linkend="ARB">ARB8</link> shape by extruding a
          quadrilateral through a given <emphasis>thickness</emphasis>.
          The arguments may be provided on the command line; if they are
          not, they will be prompted for. The <emphasis>x1,
          y1,</emphasis> and <emphasis>z1</emphasis> are the coordinates
          of one corner of the quadrilateral. <emphasis>x2, y2,
          z2,</emphasis> and <emphasis>x3, y3, z3</emphasis> are the
          coordinates of two other corners. Only two coordinates of the
          fourth point are specified, and the code calculates the third
          coordinate to ensure all four points are coplanar. The
          <emphasis>x|y|z</emphasis> parameter indicates which
          coordinate of the fourth point will be calculated by the code.
          The <emphasis>coord1</emphasis> and
          <emphasis>coord2</emphasis> parameters supply the other two
          coordinates. The direction of extrusion for the quadrilateral
          is determined from the order of the four resulting points by
          the right-hand rule; the quadrilateral is extruded toward a
          viewer for whom the points appear in counter-clockwise order.

          This command controls the angle/distance cursor. The

          display of the angle/distance cursor (ADC). The
          <emphasis>-i</emphasis> option, if specified, causes the given

          <emphasis>-i</emphasis> option is ignored when getting values
          or when used with subcommands where this option makes no
          sense. You can also control the position, angles, and radius
          of the ADC using a knob or the
          <link linkend="knob">knob</link> command. This command accepts

    It is often convenient to use the center of the view when visually
    selecting key locations in the model for construction or animation
    because of (1) the visible centering dot on the screen, (2) the fact
    that zoom and rotation are performed with respect to the view
    center, (3) the default center-mouse behavior is to move the
    indicated point to the view center, and (4) the angle/distance
    cursors are centered by default. This command provides the means to
    set and retrieve those values numerically.

        <para>
          Objects in a <emphasis>BRL-CAD</emphasis> model are stored as
          Boolean trees (combinations), with the members being primitive
          shapes or other Boolean trees. Each member has a
          transformation matrix associated with it. This arrangement
          allows a primitive to be a member of a combination, and that
          combination may be a member of another combination, and so on.
          When a combination is displayed, the transformation matrices
          are applied to its members and passed down through the
          combinations to the leaf (primitive shape) level. The
          accumulated transformation matrix is then applied to the
          primitive before it is drawn on the screen. The
          <quote>copyeval</quote> command creates a new primitive object
          called <emphasis>new_ primitive</emphasis> by applying the
          transformation matrices accumulated along the
          <emphasis>path_to_old_primitive</emphasis> to the leaf
          primitive shape object at the end of the path and saving the
          result under the name <emphasis>new_ primitive</emphasis>. The
          <emphasis>path_to_old_ primitive</emphasis>must be a

          The <quote>dbconcat</quote> command concatenates an existing
          <emphasis>BRL-CAD</emphasis> database to the database
          currently being edited. If an <emphasis>affix</emphasis> is
          supplied, then all objects from the
          <emphasis>database_file</emphasis> will have that
          <emphasis>affix</emphasis> added to their names. The
          <emphasis>-s</emphasis> option indicates that the
          <emphasis>affix</emphasis> is a suffix, while the
          <emphasis>-p</emphasis> option (default) indicates that the
          <emphasis>affix</emphasis> is a prefix. Note that each
          <emphasis>BRL-CAD</emphasis> object must have a unique name,
          so care must be taken not to <quote>dbconcat</quote> a
          database that has objects with names the same as objects in
          the current database. The <link linkend="dup">dup</link>
          command may be used to check for duplicate names. If the
          <emphasis>dup</emphasis> command finds duplicate names, use
          the <emphasis>prefix</emphasis> option to both the
          <emphasis>dup</emphasis> and <emphasis>dbconcat</emphasis>
          commands to find a <emphasis>prefix</emphasis> that produces
          no duplicates. If duplicate names are encountered during the
          <quote>dbconcat</quote> process, and no
          <emphasis>affix</emphasis> is supplied, computer-generated
          prefixes will be added to the object names coming from the
          <emphasis>database_file</emphasis> (but member names appearing
          in combinations will not be modified, so this is a dangerous
          practice and should be avoided). If the
          <emphasis>-t</emphasis> option is specified, then the title of
          the <emphasis>database_file</emphasis> will become the new
          title of the current <emphasis>BRL-CAD</emphasis> database. If
          the <emphasis>-u</emphasis> option is specified, the units of
          the current database will be set to that of the
          <emphasis>database_file</emphasis> being concatted. The
          <emphasis>-c</emphasis> option specifies that the region color
          table in the concatted <emphasis>database_file</emphasis>
          should replace any region color table in the current
          <emphasis>BRL-CAD</emphasis> database.

 <programlisting>
        -config b|c|g          Configure the GUI to display the command window, the
                               graphics window, or both. This option is useful only when
                               the GUI is combining the text and graphics windows. See the
                               -c option.

       -d display_string       Display/draw the GUI on the screen indicated by the
                               display_string. Note that this string format is the same as
                               the X DISPLAY environment variable.

       -gd display_string      Display/draw the graphics window on the screen indicated by
                               the display_string. Note that this string format is the same
                               as the X DISPLAY environment variable.

       -dt graphics_type       Indicates the type of graphics windows to use. The possible
                               choices are X and ogl (for machines that support OpenGL).
                               Defaults to ogl, if supported; otherwise X.

       -id name                Specify the id to use when referring to this instance of the
                               GUI.

       -c                      Combine text window and display manager windows.

       -s                      Use separate text window and display manager windows. This
                               is the default behavior.

       -j                      Join the collaborative session.

       -h                      Print the help message.

          illuminate</emphasis> mode, this command selects the specific
          shape for editing. In <emphasis>object illuminate</emphasis>
          mode, this command selects the leaf object for the object
          path, then the user may use the mouse to select where along
          the object path the editing should be applied. In both modes,
          the <emphasis>ill</emphasis> command will only succeed if the
          specified <emphasis>obj_name</emphasis> is only referenced
          once in the displayed objects; otherwise a <emphasis>multiply
          referenced</emphasis> message will be displayed. If the

          <emphasis>inside</emphasis> an existing shape. This command is
          typically used to create an <emphasis>inside</emphasis> shape
          that can be subtracted from the original shape to produce a
          hollow shell. The command is typically used with no arguments,
          and it prompts the user for all needed information; however,
          all the parameters may be supplied on the command line. If
          MGED is in <emphasis>primitive
          edit mode</emphasis> when the <quote>inside</quote>
          command is issued, then the shape currently being edited will
          be used as the <quote>outside_shape.</quote> Similarly, if
          MGED is in <emphasis>matrix edit
          mode</emphasis> when the <quote>inside</quote> command
          is executed, then the current key
          shape will be used as the outside shape.

          The <quote>knob</quote> command is used internally by MGED in
          the processing of knob input devices and is not recommended
          for users. The <emphasis>knob</emphasis> command provides a
          method for simulating knob input. With no options, it will
          display the current values for the knobs. With the
          <emphasis>zap</emphasis> or <emphasis>zero</emphasis> command
          provided, all the knob values will be reset to zero. If an
          <emphasis>id</emphasis> and <emphasis>value</emphasis> are
          provided, the specified knob setting will be simulated. If the
          <emphasis>-i</emphasis> option is specified, then the value
          provided will be used as an increment to be applied to the
          indicated knob. The knobs have different functions depending
          on the current mode. For example, if in primitive or matrix
          edit mode and a rotation or translation function is selected,
          the knob effects are applied to the edited object by default.
          However, the <emphasis>-v</emphasis> (view coordinates) and
          <emphasis>-m</emphasis> (model coordinates) options may be
          used to adjust the view without modifying primitives or
          matrices. The <emphasis>-e</emphasis> option allows the knob
          effects to be applied to the edited object when they would
          normally be applied to the view. The <emphasis>-o</emphasis>
          option allows the origin of rotation to be specified with
          <emphasis>v</emphasis>, <emphasis>m</emphasis>,
          <emphasis>e</emphasis>, and <emphasis>k</emphasis>, indicating
          view, model, and eye and keypoint, respectively. The units for
          <emphasis>value</emphasis> are degrees for rotation and local
          units for translation. The available <emphasis>knob

          <link linkend="path">path</link>, then any transformation
          matrices along that <emphasis>path</emphasis> are applied. If
          the final <emphasis>path</emphasis> component is a
          combination, the command will list the

          <emphasis>combination</emphasis> and will indicate any
          accumulated transformations (including any in that

          primitive shapes, detailed
          <emphasis>shape</emphasis> parameters will be displayed with
          the accumulated transformation applied. If the
          <emphasis>-r</emphasis> (recursive) option is used, then each
          <emphasis>object</emphasis> on the command line will be
          treated as a <emphasis>path</emphasis>. If the
          <emphasis>path</emphasis> does not end at a primitive
          <emphasis>shape</emphasis>, then all possible
          <emphasis>paths</emphasis> from that point down to individual

          <emphasis>shape</emphasis> at the end of each possible
          <emphasis>path</emphasis> will be listed with its parameters
          adjusted by the accumulated transformation.

          The <quote>oscale</quote> command of matrix edit mode modifies
          the matrix to perform a uniform scale operation. A

          associated object, and a <emphasis>scale_factor</emphasis> of
          0.5 reduces it by half.

          The <quote>overlay</quote> command plots the specified UNIX

          object names are created for each part of the plot file that

          to the specified <emphasis>name</emphasis>, or to
          <quote>_PLOT_OVER</quote> if no name is provided. The color
          suffix is built by converting the
          <link linkend="RGB">RGB</link> color to a six digit hex
          number. Each color corresponds to 2 hex digits, so that white
          becomes <quote>ffffff,</quote> red becomes

          The <quote>p</quote> command provides precise control over
          primitive editing operations that would normally be done using
          the mouse or knobs. For example, a shape rotate may be
          performed by selecting <emphasis>rotate</emphasis> from the
          primitive edit menu, then providing the rotation angles with
          the <emphasis>p</emphasis> command. A command of <quote>p 0 30
          0</quote> would rotate the edited shape through 30˚ about the
          <emphasis>y</emphasis> axis. Similarly, many of the individual
          parameters of the edited shape may be set exactly using the
          <emphasis>p</emphasis> command. If the <emphasis>scale
          H</emphasis> menu item is selected while editing a
          <link linkend="TGC">TGC</link>, then the
          <emphasis>value1</emphasis> supplied with a
          <emphasis>p</emphasis> command specifies the actual length of
          the height vector for that <emphasis>TGC</emphasis>. This
          method is the recommended technique to set precise values for
          shape parameters. The
          <link linkend="translate">translate</link> and
          <link linkend="rotobj">rotobj</link> commands provide a
          similar capability for object editing.

          <emphasis>-D</emphasis> option allows the user to specify a
          starting frame number, and the <emphasis>-K</emphasis> option
          allows the specification of an ending frame number. The

          viewing direction such that the eye is positioned along the
          direction vector (<emphasis>dx dy dz</emphasis>) from the view
          center and is looking towards the view center. The

          about the viewing direction. The <link linkend="ae">ae</link>
          command provides a similar capability.

          operations are performed first, proceeding left to right; then
          union operations are performed. <emphasis>BRL-CAD</emphasis>
          regions are special cases of <emphasis>BRL-CAD</emphasis>

          <emphasis>rtcheck</emphasis>. The default option of
          <emphasis>-s50</emphasis> indicates that the checking rays

          The <quote>vdraw</quote> command allows drawing of lines and

          the list, or delete all or part of the list. All vertices in
          the <emphasis>vdraw</emphasis> command are in millimeters. The

    Provides a mechanism to get/set resource values for the given
    resource types. The supported resource types are: ax (Axes), c
    (Color Schemes), g (Grid), r (Rubber Band), and var (MGED
    Variables). Basically, <emphasis>rset</emphasis> always gets a value
    unless enough information is given to set a value. For example, with
    no parameters, <emphasis>rset</emphasis> returns a list of all
    resource values for the supported resource types. If
    <emphasis>rset</emphasis> is executed with only the
    <emphasis>res_type</emphasis> given, a list of all resource values
    for the given <emphasis>res_type</emphasis> is returned.

    <emphasis>Mged</emphasis> is the interactive graphical editor for

    <emphasis role="strong">model coordinates</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
    In a <emphasis>BRL­CAD</emphasis> model, the <emphasis>model
    coordinates</emphasis> are the actual coordinates of points on the
    model in <emphasis>real</emphasis> units. The user may position a
    model at any desired location in <emphasis>model
    coordinates</emphasis>. By convention in
    <emphasis>BRL­CAD</emphasis>, a model is oriented so that the
    positive <emphasis>x</emphasis>-axis points from the model’s back to
    its front, the positive <emphasis>y</emphasis>-axis points from the
    model’s right to its left, and, since the coordinate system is right
    handed, the positive <emphasis>z</emphasis>-axis points from the
    model’s bottom to its top. All <emphasis>BRL­CAD</emphasis> models
    are stored in millimeters, however the user may operate in nearly
    any units by using the

    <emphasis>Objects</emphasis> are the fundamental entities

    nodes of the <link linkend="DAG">DAG</link> into which the database

  <para>
    A <emphasis>path</emphasis> to an
    <link linkend="object">object</link> in <emphasis>BRL­CAD</emphasis>
    is a list of <link linkend="COMBINATION">combinations</link> that
    ends at the desired <link linkend="object">object</link>.
    <emphasis>Paths</emphasis> are specified with a syntax similar to
    the one used in UNIX file systems (with ``/’’ characters as
    separators). Each element of the <emphasis>path</emphasis> must be a
    <link linkend="member">member</link> of the previous element. For
    example, ``left_arm/arm/hand/thumb’’ might be a
    <emphasis>path</emphasis> from ``left_arm’<quote>to ``thumb</quote>’
    in some <emphasis>BRL­CAD</emphasis> database indicating that
    ``arm’’ is a <link linkend="member">member</link> of
    ``left_arm’<quote>, ``hand</quote>’ is a
    <link linkend="member">member</link> of ``arm’<quote>, and
    ``thumb</quote>’ is a <link linkend="member">member</link> of
    ``hand’’. The <emphasis>path</emphasis> information implies a set of
    transformation matrices (each <link linkend="member">member</link>
    of a <link linkend="COMBINATION">combination</link> has a
    transformation matrix associated with it). As a
    <emphasis>path</emphasis> is traversed, the effects of encountered
    transformation matrices are accumulated, and typically applied to
    the <link linkend="object">object</link> at the end of the
    <emphasis>path</emphasis>. This means that the ``thumb’’ referred to
    by the <emphasis>path</emphasis> ``left_arm/arm/hand/thumb’<quote>is
    likely to be in a different location and orientation (and possibly
    scaled) from the ``thumb</quote><quote>referred to by

  <para>
    <emphasis>Ray tracing</emphasis> is the main method for

    by selecting a start point and a ray direction, then calculating the

    according to the <link linkend="BOOLEAN">Boolean</link> expressions

    intersect each <link linkend="REGION">region</link> along the ray.

The ARB is a planar-faced convex solid with between four and eight unique vertices. The specific type of ARB is often referred to by adding the number of unique vertices to the word ARB. For example, an ARB8 is the usual solid block, an ARB4 is a tetrahedron, and an ARB6 may be a wedge shape.

<para>
The arbitrary faceted solid (Also referred to as ARS) is a planar-faced solid defined by any number of curves (more precisely closed polylines). These curves are typically planar waterline or station curves, but they are not restricted to being planar. Each curve in a particular ARS must have the same number of points. The first and last curves are normally degenerate, each consisting of repetitions of a single point to make up the correct number of points for a curve. Faces are built by connecting corresponding points on adjacent curves. Since the curves are assumed to be closed, the last point on any curve is implicitly connected to the first point on the same curve

</para>
<para>
The extruded bitmap (also referred to as EBM) is a solid based on a greyscale bitmap. The bitmap is an array of unsigned char values, see bw(5), and is extruded by some distance. The EBM solid requires the dimensions of the bitmap file (height and width in bytes), an extrusion length, and a transformation matrix to position the EBM. Each byte in the bitmap file is treated as the base of a cell that is extruded by the specified extrusion length. If the value of the byte is non­zero, then that cell is considered solid.

</para>
<para>
The particle solid is a lozenge-shaped object defined by a vertex, a height vector and radii at both ends. The body of the particle is either a cylinder or a truncated cone, depending on the values of the radii. Each end of the particle is a hemisphere of the specified radius.
</para>
<para xml:id="pipe"><emphasis role="bold">

</emphasis>
</para>
<para>
The pipe solid is defined by a sequence of control points, each with values for inner radius, outer radius, and bend radius. The actual pipe starts at the first control point and ends at the last control point. The intervening control points are replaced by circular bends with the specified bend radius, so the pipe is not likely to actually pass through these points. An inner radius of zero indicates a solid pipe or wire.

<para>
The spline solid is defined by a set of non­uniform rational B­spline surfaces (NURBS). There are no trimming curves in the spline solid, so each NURB surface must exactly adjoin its neighbor so that the interior of the spline solid is completely enclosed and no parts of any NURB surface are dangling outside the solid.
</para>

<para>
The TGC solid is a truncated cone with elliptical (or circular) base and top. The base and top must be parallel, but the height vector connecting the center of the base with the center of the top does not need to be perpendicular to them.
</para>
<para xml:id="vol"><emphasis role="bold">

<para>
The vol solid is defined by a 3-dimensional array of unsigned char values. The solid requires a file of these values, the extent of the file (in bytes) in each dimension, the size of each cell, and high and low thresholds. Any value in the file that is between the thresholds (inclusive) represents a solid cell.
