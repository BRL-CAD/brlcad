    <para>
      As mentioned previously, the Build Pattern tool automates the process of
      making copies of existing geometry in rectangular, spherical, or
      cylindrical patterns. The user can choose to pattern at any of three
      depths of duplication: top, regions, and primitives.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Build Pattern tool is run from the graphical user interface (GUI)
      (under the Tools menu); it currently has no command-line equivalent. The
      bottom of the pattern control GUI is a usage dialog box that lists
      pertinent information about each item on the GUI as the user mouses over
      the text.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are many input fields. Some stand alone, and others belong to series
      that work together to provide the needed information for a specific
      option. Each series is denoted by a diamond-shaped check box. If the
      diamond is highlighted red, then all fields in that series are required.
      All required fields must be filled in for the pattern tool to work
      properly. It is also important to note that all dimensions must be in
      millimeters and that no commas should be used in number strings.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Build Pattern tool is designed to work from a prototype geometry
      object. That is to say, the object that is patterned is not included in
      the resultant pattern.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="build_pattern_names"><info><title>Pattern Names</title></info>

    <para>
      As shown in Figure E-1, the tool appends three numbers to all patterned
      objects (unless you are using the increment option for primitives, in
      which case, the numbers for regions and primitives are incremented by the
      increment amount). For rectangular patterns, the first number is the
      X axis offset, the second is the Y axis offset, and the third is the Z
      axis offset. For spherical patterns, the first number references the
      azimuth, the second references the elevation, and the third references the
      radii. For cylindrical patterns, the first number references the radii,
      the second number references the height, and the third number references
      the azimuth.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="build_pattern_fields"><info><title>Common Fields for all Patterns:</title></info>

    <para>
      There are several fields in the pattern tool GUI that are common to all
      types of patterns.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Group Name field is for the name of the combination to be created (or
      appended to) by a pattern call.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Source String and Replacement String fields must be used together. The
      source string is the set of characters in each element of the patterned
      object to be changed. The replacement string is the set of characters that
      will replace the source string.
    </para>

    <para>
      The Increment field is only for use when duplicating to the primitive level.
      It is added to the leftmost number field of each primitive. To determine the
      increment, examine the primitives of the object(s) you wish to pattern and find
      the largest span. For example, to create a pattern to the primitive level with
      the following primitives (which may or may not be in regions or
      assemblies):

      <literallayout class="normal">
part.s22 part.s22-1 part.s23 part.s24 part.s24+1 part.s24-1 part.s25,
      </literallayout>

      one needs to determine the span. Note that the leftmost numbers in these
      primitives range from
	22&#x2013;25. <!-- en dash symbol -->
      Thus, as shown in the following expression, the span is
      four (inclusively).

      *******NEED FIGURE HERE*****

      If we use an increment of four, we will get the following set of primitives.

      <literallayout class="normal">
part.s26 part.s26-1 part.s27 part.s28 part.s28+1 part.s28-1 part.s29
      </literallayout>

      Although it is acceptable to use a greater increment, gaps in numbers may be
      troublesome if one is using this capability extensively.
    </para>

    <para>
      Finally, the Objects field is used for the names of all the items to be
      patterned.
    </para>

  <section xml:id="build_pattern_stringsub"><info><title>String Substitution</title></info>

    <para>
     It is also possible to create a pattern in which a string of characters in
     each element in the object is changed (e.g., "l_" -&gt; "r_"). This is useful
     for symmetry applications (e.g., left - right) or series (e.g., 1 - n).
     Each element of the object must have the source string so the user must be
     thorough and name each primitive, region, and assembly properly. Consider
     the following example:

     <inlinemediaobject><imageobject role="html"><imagedata fileref="../../articles/images/build_pattern_fig07.png"/></imageobject><imageobject role="fo"><imagedata fileref="../../articles/images/build_pattern_fig07.png"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
    </para>
    <para>
      Top-level duplications copy the patterned object and reference its entire
      structure with matrices, as follows:

      <literallayout class="normal">
/pattern group
       /COPIED assemblies [MATRICES]
	    /assemblies
		  /regions
			/primitives
      </literallayout>

      Region-level duplications copy all assembly and regions and reference from the
      region level down with matrices.

      <literallayout class="normal">
/pattern group
       /COPIED assemblies
	    /COPIED regions [MATRICES]
/primitives
      </literallayout>

      Primitive-level duplications copy the entire tree structure to the primitive
      level without matrices using an increment on all primitives.

      <literallayout class="normal">
/pattern group
       /COPIED assemblies       NO MATRICES
	    /COPIED regions
		 /COPIED primitives
      </literallayout>
    </para>

  <section xml:id="build_pattern_recpatterns"><info><title>Rectangular Patterns</title></info>

    <para>
      The rectangular pattern GUI (shown in Figure E-2) is designed to
      facilitate one-, two-, or three-dimensional rectangular patterns. The
      default X, Y, and Z directions are positive along each axis. In order to
      create a rectangle that is not axis aligned, these vectors may be changed
      with the condition that each must remain precisely perpendicular to the
      other two. If the Use Directions series is checked, the user specifies the
      number of copies and the Delta between copies for each axis. If the Use
      Lists series is checked, the user can specify a list of deltas along each
      axis.
    </para>

  <section xml:id="build_pattern_spherical"><info><title>Spherical Patterns</title></info>

    <para>
      The spherical pattern GUI (shown in Figure E-3) facilitates sphere-shaped
      patterns rotated around a center vertex using user-specified radii with
      azimuth and elevation angles. As shown in Figure E-4, the patterned
      objects--in this case, a series of arrows--may be oriented as built around
      the sphere or rotated by azimuth and/or elevation such that they are
      oriented toward the pattern center using the Rotate Azimuth and Rotate
      Elevation check boxes.
    </para>

    <para>
      As shown in Figure E-4, the Pattern Center field is the coordinate at the
      center of the pattern. The Object Center field is a user-defined
      coordinate used to locate the object(s) relative to the pattern center. It
      acts as the key point for any transformations to the pattern object(s).
    </para>

    <para>
      The Starting Azimuth and Starting Elevation fields follow the same
      right-hand-rule Cartesian coordinate conventions as Multi-Device Geometry
      Editor (MGED) viewing. The Starting Radius is the distance from the
      Pattern Center to the object center at the user-specified azimuths and
      elevations.
    </para>

    <para>
      If the Create Az/El series is checked, the user defines the number of
      azimuths and elevations and the deltas between each. If the Use Lists
      series is checked, the user must specify a list of azimuths and/or
      elevations.
    </para>

    <para>
      The Create Radii and Use Radii List series define offsets from the
      Starting Radius, allowing the user to create a pattern of concentric
      spheres. If Create Radii is checked, the user specifies
      the Number of Radii and the Radius Delta in order to construct a number of
      equally offset sphere patterns. If the Use Radii List is checked, the user
      specifies a list of radius offsets.
    </para>

    </figure>

    <para>
      Without the Rotate Azimuth or Rotate Elevation boxes checked, the
      patterned objects are oriented as built without any rotations. Notice, for
      example, that every arrow in Figure E-5 points to the left. Notice also
      that for each patterned arrow, the Object Center (here specified as the
      tip of the arrow) is located on the circle outline at a distance of one
      Starting Radius from the Pattern Center. If we set the Object Center to
      the coordinate at the base of the arrow, the base would then lie on the
      circular outline. Wherever the Object Center is set is the point at which
      MGED works with the Object Center coordinate to place and rotate patterned
      objects.

  <section xml:id="build_pattern_cylind"><info><title>Cylindrical Patterns</title></info>

    <para>
      The cylindrical pattern GUI (shown in Figure E-6) facilitates the creation
      of cylinder-shaped patterns with user-defined center, direction, height,
      azimuth, and radii inputs. The Base Center is the vertex of the cylinder
      shape. The Object Center is a user-defined coordinate used to locate the
      object(s) relative to the Base Center and Height Direction. It acts as the
      key point for any transformations to the pattern object(s). The Height
      Direction is the vector along which the cylinder runs. The Starting Height
      is the offset from the Base Center along the Height Direction that the
      pattern will place the Object Center.
