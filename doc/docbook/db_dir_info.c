 * This is a stub file, whose purpose is to provide the Docbook logic with an
 * add_executable build target that can be passed to scripts in order to decode
 * at runtime what the location of BR-CAD's build directory is.
 *
 * Unlike most other BRL-CAD logic, Docbook building may be done without any
 * software build targets needing to be processed if the necessary system
 * tools are in place.  Since it is otherwise difficult to reliably get the
 * location of the current build directory in multiconfig build tools, this
 * file is used to provide a db_dir_info build target to reference in CMake.
