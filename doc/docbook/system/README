The files in these directories represent per-topic Docbook files in
the style of UNIX man pages, and use standard man1, man3, etc.
directory layouts for toplevel directory structure.

man1: executable programs and shell commands
man2: system calls (provided by kernel; avoid)
man3: library functions
man4: special files and networking interfaces (e.g., /dev/* devices; avoid)
man5: file formats and conventions (e.g., /etc/passwd)
man6: games and demos
man7: standards and miscellaneous (e.g., environments, charsets, formatting macros; avoid)
man8: system administration commands (usually require root; avoid)
man9: kernel and windowing system routines (non-standard; avoid)
manl: local commands (non-standard; avoid)
mann: "new" (non-standard, primarily Tcl/Tk commands, ncurses API)

The file mged_cmd_template.xml represents a blank template for
converting existing MGED command documentation such as that found
in the mged_cmd_index.html file or Volume II Appendix.  It is not
required to use this precise template for all MGED commands - see
search.xml for a more elaborate example - but it should provide
a convenient "container" for what has been the common documentation
format in previous work.

The file './man1/en/rt.xml' is a good example of the format for a
command-line BRL-CAD user command.
