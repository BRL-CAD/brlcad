  <para>
	Starting with BRL-CAD database format version 5, BRL-CAD supports
	the storage of arbitrary attribute/value data on any database object.
	Prior to the development of this generic ability, BRL-CAD supported a
	set of standard attributes used to hold key information about specific
	properties. These conventions predate not only the version 5
	database format but BRL-CAD itself.  The purpose of this man page
	is to identify the standard attributes, document situations where
	two or more attributes are used to identify the same property,
	and identify where appropriate what constitutes meaningful values
	for an attribute.
  </para>

  <para>
	The earliest ancestor of BRL-CAD was the MAGIC code, written by
	the Mathematical Applications Group, Inc. in 1967 to implement geometric
	modeling ideas developed by BRL and AMSAA from 1958-1967.  That system,
	which was entirely non-graphical, was followed some years later by the GIFT
        program&#x2014;Geometric Information From Targets.  LIBRT, appearing around 1983,
        became the successor to GIFT.
	Today it is the core library of the BRL-CAD solid modeling package.  (For more background
	see http://ftp.arl.army.mil/~mike/papers/96thebook/).  LIBRT inherited
	both geometric primitives and attributes from GIFT--this heritage
	is occasionally apparent in attribute names.
  </para>
  <para>
	Note that with the introduction of support for arbitrary attribute/value pairs
	it becomes much simpler for both developers and users to formulate new standards of their
	own for storage of metadata in attributes.  Attributes should only
	be documented in this file if one or more core BRL-CAD tools has implemented
	one or more features that require specific attributes to be present.  Conventions
	for attribute names that do not involve tool support should be documented
	in appropriate user-level documentation.  In documenting attributes, one
	additional distinction is made:  attributes that exist only as post-v5 attribute/value
	pairs are referred to as non-core attributes; older
	attributes (which may also be represented in core data structures) are referred
	to as core attributes.

  <para>
	The following table lists all known standard (core) BRL-CAD attributes and
	aliases.  Any code setting or reading the value of one of these attributes
	must handle all aliases to ensure all functions asking for
	the value in question get a consistent answer.

        Given the importance of these attributes, it is appropriate to
        briefly outline the meaning and purpose of each of them:
