  <refsection xml:id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>
    <command>remrt</command> is intended to be an entirely plug-compatible replacement for
    the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rt</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    program.  While  <emphasis remap='I'>rt</emphasis>  can operate on more than one processor
    of a shared memory MIMD style  multi-processor, it can not spread the work out across the network.
    <command>remrt</command> and its companion program
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rtsrv</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    implement a
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>libpkg</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>-based
    protocol for distributing the task of ray-traced rendering out to an arbitrary number of
    processors on the network. Those processors can be from an arbitrary mix of vendors, with
    differing instruction sets and data representations, operating at widely different speeds.
  </para>

  <para>
    <command>remrt</command> provides two levels of fault-tolerance in its distributed
    computation. First, any <emphasis remap='I'>rtsrv</emphasis> processor which fails (or whose
    network link fails) will have its work reassigned automatically by <command>remrt</command>
    to other processors, so that the failure of that processor does not hold up the progress of
    the computation.  On a regular interval <command>remrt</command> attempts to restart computation
    on failed processors marked "active", so that when failed systems become available again they are
    put back to work. Second, <command>remrt</command> offers a form of "checkpoint-restart" by
    carefully writing all received pixel data immediately to disk.  If the machine running
    <command>remrt</command> should fail, when <command>remrt</command> is restarted, it will
    determine what work remains to be done and restart all the <emphasis remap='I'>rtsrv</emphasis>
    processes on the remote machines.
  </para>

  <para>
    <command>remrt</command>
    takes exactly the same set of command line arguments as
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rt</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
    For a full discussion of those options, consult the
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rt</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    manual page. From within
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>mged</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    the <command>remrt</command> program can be run from the current
    <emphasis remap='I'>mged</emphasis> view by giving the
    <emphasis remap='I'>mged</emphasis>
  command</para>

  <literallayout remap='.nf'>
    rrt remrt -M -s###
  </literallayout> <!-- .fi -->

  <para>
    where "###" is the image resolution desired.
  </para>

  <para>
    <command>remrt</command> depends on the Berkeley <emphasis remap='I'>rsh (1)</emphasis>
    remote shell command and the user's corresponding ".rhosts" file to automatically
    initiate remote computation.
  </para>

  <para>
    <command>remrt</command>
    requires a control file called ".remrtrc" which specifies a few essential parameters
    of the server machines (network hosts) that are to participate in the distributed
    computation.  The ".remrtrc" file contains a list of normal <command>remrt</command>
    commands which are to be executed before distributed processing is to begin.
    This can be useful for establishing a variety of user-specific defaults. However,
    the most important command to provide is a "host" command to describe each of the
    remote hosts that will (or may) participate in the distributed computation.
    Here is a sample ".remrt" file:
  </para>

  <!-- .in +5 -->

  <literallayout remap='.nf'>
    host wolf	passive cd /tmp/cad/.remrt.4d
    host voyage	always cd /tmp/cad/.remrt.4d
    host whiz	hacknight convert /tmp
  </literallayout> <!-- .fi -->

  <!-- .in -->

  <para>
    The first argument to the "host" command is the name of the server machine.
    It will be converted to a fully qualified name by calling
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>gethostbyname</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    and
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>gethostbyaddr</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
  </para>

  <para>
    The second argument to the "host" command describes "when" this machine should be used.

	<para>
	  before starting up the <emphasis remap='I'>rtsrv</emphasis>
	  program in that same directory. This relieves the user of the burden of
	  setting up the ".g" database file, but suffers from several drawbacks.
	  First, the transmission of a large database can take a noticeable
	  amount of time.
	  Second, should the server host go down and then
	  re-join the fray, the database will be sent again, because
	  <command>remrt</command>
	  has no easy way to tell if the previous ".g" file is still intact
	  after the crash/restart.
	  Third, <command>remrt</command> has no way to tell what auxiliary files
	  might be needed for this ".g" file, and thus can not send them automatically.
	  If the ".g" file references height field, extruded bit-map, or volumetric
	  solids, the associated data files will not be present on a
	  <emphasis remap='B'>convert</emphasis>
	  mode server.  The same applies for texture map and bump map files.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <para>
    <command>remrt</command>
    uses several different strategies for optimizing the dispatching of work.
    These can be controlled by the "allocate" command. If "allocate frame" has
    been specified, then the work allocation method is a "free for all",
    allocating work from one frame at a time to all servers as they become ready
    for more. This maximizes the CPU overhead for prepping (because all CPUs will
    prep all frames), but it also provides the shortest wall-clock time
    to getting the first frame finished. This mode is recommended for demonstrations,
    and other situations where people are sitting around waiting for results
    to appear on the screen.
  </para>

  <para>
    If the
    "allocate load" command has been given, then new servers will not be assigned to
    a given frame unless there is at least enough work remaining on that frame to
    require 10 percent of that server's measured performance capacity.
    Otherwise the server is started on a subsequent frame.
  </para>

  <para>
    If the "allocate movie" command is given, then each server is allocated a whole
    frame to do.  This minimizes the CPU time spent in the overhead of prepping the
    frame, and tends to maximize overall throughput, at the price of making you
    wait a long time for the first frame to finish.  This mode is best used when
    crunching out large numbers of frames for an animation.
    (See also the
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>scriptsort</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    command for a clever power-of-two script rearrangement technique first
    proposed by Jim Blinn).
  </para>

  <para>
    The output can be stored either in a file, or sent to the current
    framebuffer, the same as with
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rt</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
  </para>

  <para>
    When <command>remrt</command> is run without command line arguments, it enters
    an interactive mode.  In this mode, the current framebuffer can be assigned and
    released, frames can be added to the list of pending work, and many other control
    and status commands can be used.
  </para>

  <para>
    Normally <command>remrt</command> runs in a batch mode, taking all its information
    from the command line, the script file on stdin, and the ".remrtrc" file.
    If you wish to issue an interactive-style command to <command>remrt</command>
    while it is running in batch mode, this can be accomplished by
    giving an extra argument to <emphasis remap='I'>rtsrv</emphasis>,
    which will simply pass on the command and exit.
  </para>
  <para>
    For example:
  </para>

  <literallayout remap='.nf'>
    rtsrv server_host 4446 status
  </literallayout> <!-- .fi -->

  <para>
    would send the command "status" to the <command>remrt</command>
    process running on the machine called "server_host" and listening
    at port 4446. 4446 is the port used by the first copy of
    <command>remrt</command> running on a machine.  If a second copy of
    <command>remrt</command> is started while the first one continues to run, it
    will be assigned port 4447.  One is added to the port number repeatedly
    until an available port is found. Normally you do not need to worry about
    which port is being used, unless you wish to send commands there directly.
    The <citerefentry><refentrytitle>netstat</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    command can sometimes be useful to track down which ports are being used.
  </para>
</refsection>

<refsection>
<example>
  <title>Performing a Basic remrt/rtsrv Raytrace</title>
  <para>
    The following steps will set up a local (single machine) example remrt session.
    This does not utilize the full power of the remrt system, but will illustrate
    how the individual pieces relate to each other.  Rather than use rsh, each
    process will be launched manually.
  </para>
  <para>
    Launch an <command>fbserv</command> instance on the desired port and with the desired type
    (we will use port 0 and /dev/X for a Linux-based X11 rendering - windows users can try /dev/wgl.)
    For a somewhat larger render we specify a size of 2048 pixels square.
  </para>
  <para>
    <userinput>fbserv -s2048 -p0 -F/dev/X</userinput>
  </para>
  <para>
    If an graphical framebuffer was specified, a window should appear.  Otherwise, fbserv will silently
    wait for input.
  </para>
  <para>
    In MGED, set up the scene you wish to render and then save a script with <command>saveview</command>
  </para>
  <para>
    <userinput>saveview remrt.rt</userinput>
  </para>
  <para>
    Edit the script and replace the <command>rt</command> command with <command>remrt</command>.  Replace
    the output file specification (<option>-o filename</option>) with a -F0 option to point the render
    to the fbserv started in the previous step. Also add a -s2048 option to specify a rendering size to
    match that provided to the fbserv.
  </para>
  <para>
    Run the script to launch remrt.  You should see output indicating the program has launched.  (Note:
    the port number printed by the default output is not useful - you want to use 4446 by default to
    connect to remrt.)

  <para>
    Most deficiencies observed while using the <command>remrt</command> program are usually
    with the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rt</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    program, with which it shares a substantial amount of common code, or with the
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>librt</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    library. If a frame fails to render properly, try processing it on a single machine using
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rt</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    to determine if the problem is in the ray-tracing side of things, or the distributed
    computation side of things.
