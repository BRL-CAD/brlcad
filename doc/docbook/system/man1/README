The files in these directories represent per-topic Docbook files in
the style of UNIX man pages, and uses standard man1, man3, etc. 
directory layouts for toplevel directory structure.

The file mged_cmd_template.xml represents a blank template for 
converting existing MGED command documentation such as that found
in the mged_cmd_index.html file or Volume II Appendix.  It is not
required to use this precise template for all MGED commands - see
search.xml for a more elaborate example - but it should provide
a convenient "container" for what has been the common documentation
format in previous work.
