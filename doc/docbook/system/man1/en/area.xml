    <para>
      Calculates an approximate presented area of one region in the
      <emphasis/>mged display. For this command to work properly, a single 
      BRL-CAD region must be displayed using the <command>E</command> command. 
      The <emphasis>tolerance</emphasis> is the distance required 
      between two vertices in order for them to be recognized as distinct 
      vertices. This calculation considers only the minimum bounding polygon 
      of the region and ignores holes.
