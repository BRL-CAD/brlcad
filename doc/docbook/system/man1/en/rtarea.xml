    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      The <emphasis remap='I'>rtarea</emphasis> command calculates the exposed, presented and centers of 
      surface areas of specified geometry objects from a particular view.  The summary 
      output includes details for individual regions, assemblies (combinations that contain
      regions), and summarized totals.  
    </para>
    <para>
      The <emphasis remap='B'>exposed </emphasis> area corresponds to what a human observer would see looking at the object(s)
      in question, if all the objects were non-transparent.  For example, say rays were cast towards two cubes, each one of which
      is a region, one in front of the other, grouped into an assembly, with the ray direction pointed into the page:
      <screen>
|----------------| Rear Cube
|                |
|                |
|        |--------------| Front Cube
|        |       |      |
|        |       |      |
|--------|-------|      |
         |              |
         |              |
         |--------------|
      </screen>

      The exposed area of the Front Cube corresponds to the total area of the sheet, since it is not
      occluded by any other object:
       <screen>
|----------------| Rear Cube
|                |
|                |
|        |--------------| Front Cube
|        |**************|
|        |**************|
|--------|**************|
         |**************|
         |**************|
         |--------------|
      </screen>

     

      The Rear Cube, on the other hand, IS occluded by the Front Cube and would thus report only a fraction
      of its area as exposed:
       <screen>
|----------------| Rear Cube
|****************|
|****************|
|********|--------------| Front Cube
|********|       |      |
|********|       |      |
|--------|-------|      |
         |              |
         |              |
         |--------------|
      </screen>

     

      An object that combines both of these sheets would thus report as its exposed area the
      sum of the exposed areas of the individual sheets:
      <screen>
|----------------| Rear Cube
|****************|
|****************|
|****************|------| Front Cube
|***********************|
|***********************|
|--------|**************|
         |**************|
         |**************|
         |--------------|
      </screen>


   </para>
   <para>
      <emphasis remap='B'>Presented</emphasis> area, unlike exposed area, does not take occlusion into account.  It is the
      equalivent of taking each object and considering it in isolation.  So for the previous
      case of two sheets of metal, the Front Cube would report the same area:

       <screen>
|----------------| Rear Cube
|                |
|                |
|        |--------------| Front Cube
|        |**************|
|        |**************|
|--------|**************|
         |**************|
         |**************|
         |--------------|
      </screen>



      the Rear Cube, on the other hand, ALSO reports its full area:
      <screen>
|----------------| Rear Cube
|****************|
|****************|
|****************-------| Front Cube
|****************|      |
|****************|      |
|--------|-------|      |
         |              |
         |              |
         |--------------|
      </screen>


      When reporting the presented area of the group, there is a subtle point - rtarea does not count area covered
      by multiple regions multiple times when totaling the presented area.  So for the group containing both cubes,
      the presented area is NOT the cumulative area of both regions' presented areas but the area of the union of those
      two areas.  In this case, that works out to be the same as the exposed area.
       <screen>
|----------------| Rear Cube
|****************|
|****************|
|****************|------| Front Cube
|***********************|
|***********************|
|--------|**************|
         |**************|
         |**************|
         |--------------|
      </screen>

          
    </para>

    <para>
      It should be noted that rtarea only counts surfaces with a surface normal that
      has a component looking back in the direction of the ray.  So, for example, a
      cube with only one face looking "back toward" the ray will not report area from
      other faces as "presented", since their surface normals will indicate they are
      not surfaces being presented to the ray.
    </para>

      WARNING: <emphasis remap='I'>Rtarea</emphasis> may not correctly report area or 
      center when instancing is done at the group level. Using <command>xpush</command> 
      can be a workaround for this problem.
