  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>Simplifies an existing <emphasis>nmg_shape</emphasis> by a process of edge
	decimation. Each edge in the <emphasis>old_nmg_shape</emphasis> is considered; if it can be deleted
	without creating an error greater than the specified <emphasis>maximum_error_dist,</emphasis> then that
	edge is deleted. If a <emphasis>minimum_angle</emphasis> is specified (degrees), then the edge will not 	be deleted if it would create a triangle with an angle less than <emphasis>minimum_angle</emphasis>. The
	resulting shape is saved in <emphasis>new_nmg_shape</emphasis>. The <emphasis>old_nmg_shape</emphasis>	must have been triangulated previous to using the <command>nmg_collapse</command> command. The resulting 	shape consists of all triangular faces.

  <title>EXAMPLES</title>
  <para>The example shows the use of the <command>nmg_collapse</command> command to simplify an existing nmg 	shape by decimating its edges. The new nmg shape will be within a maximum error distribution and will 	not have any triangles with angles less than a given minimum.

    <para>Decimates edges in <emphasis>nmg_old</emphasis> to produce an NMG with an error no greater than 1.0
	units. The process will not create any triangles with an angle less than 10°. The new
	NMG shape will be named <emphasis>nmg_new</emphasis>.
