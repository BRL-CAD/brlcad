      Prints a list of all the memory blocks that have been allocated and 
      recorded in the <emphasis>memdebug</emphasis> table. Memory allocation 
      is not normally recorded in the <emphasis>memdebug</emphasis> table, but 
      executing the <command>debugbu 2</command> command will turn on the 
      &lt;MEM_CHECK&gt; flag, and as long as that flag is set, all memory 
      allocation will be recorded.
