    <para>
      Set the view orientation for the <emphasis>mged</emphasis> display by rotating 
      the eye position about the center of the viewing cube. The eye position is 
      determined by the supplied azimuth and elevation angles (degrees). The 
      <emphasis>azimuth</emphasis> angle is measured in the <emphasis>xy</emphasis> 
      plane with the positive <emphasis>x</emphasis> direction corresponding to an 
      azimuth of 0°. Positive azimuth angles are measured counter-clockwise about 
      the positive <emphasis>z</emphasis> axis. Elevation angles are
      measured from the <emphasis>xy</emphasis> plane with +90° corresponding to the 
      positive <emphasis>z</emphasis> direction and -90 corresponding to the negative 
      <emphasis>z</emphasis> direction. If an optional <emphasis>twist</emphasis> angle 
      is included, the view will be rotated about the viewing direction by the 
      specified <emphasis>twist</emphasis> angle. The <emphasis>-i</emphasis> option 
      results in the angles supplied being interpreted as increments.

      The examples show how to change views by entering azimuth and elevation angles, 
      adding a twist angle, and having the angles supplied being treated as increments.
