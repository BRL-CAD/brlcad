  <title>DESCRIPTIONS</title>
  <para>
    <command>all_sf</command> is an interactive program used to create 
    a file containing shape factors between all regions of the named objects.  
    The shape factor from region i to region j is the fraction of total energy 
    radiated from region i that is intercepted by region j.  This program finds
    the shapefactors for all regions in an mged model not just shapefactors
    between engine regions.
  </para>

  <para>
    All_sf uses a Monte Carlo simulation, so increasing the number of
    significant digits in the answer by one requires about a 100-fold 
    increase in the number of rays fired.
  </para>

  <para>
    Three different files are created by <command>all_sf</command>: an output file, a 
    longwave radiation exchange file, and an error file.  The output file lists the
    shapefactors between each region.  The longwave radiation exchange
    file is for use with PRISM.  This file is not quite PRISM ready so the
    user must fill in the missing parameters if it is to be used with
    PRISM.  The error file is basically used for checking errors in the
    program and probably will not be used by the average user.
