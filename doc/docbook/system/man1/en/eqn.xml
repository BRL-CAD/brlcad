  <para>Allows the user to rotate the face of an ARB shape by providing
    the coefficients of an equation of the desired plane for the face. The coefficients <emphasis>A, B,</emphasis>          	and <emphasis>C</emphasis> are from the plane equation:

    <equation>
	<mathphrase>Ax + By + Cz = D</mathphrase>

  </para>
<para>
The user must be editing an <emphasis>ARB</emphasis> shape and be rotating a face of the <emphasis>ARB</emphasis> for         this command to have any effect. When entering such a state, the user will be asked which of the face vertices should be  held constant, and from this information the <emphasis>D</emphasis> coefficient of the equation is determined.
