  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>Creates an ARB6 with the specified height at a particular
	face of the given RPP. The optional “0” and “1” refer to the orientation of the ARB6.
	If “0” is chosen, the peaks of the ARB6 are positioned at the midpoint between the
	first and second points and at the midpoint between the third and fourth points of the
	specified face. If “1” is chosen, the peaks of the ARB6 are positioned at the midpoint
	between the first and fourth points and at the midpoint between the second and third
	points of the specified face. The default is 0.
