<refsection xml:id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para><command>dbupgrade</command>
operates on the currently open input geometry databasefile in MGED.  After dbupgrade is complete,
the working database will be upgraded and a backup file will be saved preserving the original "pre-upgrade"
version of the .g file.  Keep the backup file until it is clear all necessary information
was successfully preserved.
</para>

<para>
Starting with v5, the geometry file format is platform independent. For v4 .g files, however,
there is a potential problem in that the floating point storage format within the file
is platform dependent.  Consequently the safest way to upgrade a v4 file is to run
<command>dbupgrade</command> on the file before transferring it from
the platform on which it was created.  If that system is no longer available, the
<command>dbupgrade</command> will attempt to automatically 'fix' an existing (v4
format) binary database that was transferred from a binary-incompatible platform.

and
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>asc2g</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
on a database to preserve a text version as a work-around for platform specific binary
files is no longer necessary.</para>

<refsection xml:id='diagnostics'><title>DIAGNOSTICS</title>
<para>Numerous error conditions are possible, usually due to errors in
the geometry database.  In the case of a binary-incompatible v4 file, some
errors may reflect incomplete conversion code.
Descriptive messages are printed on standard error (file descriptor 2).
