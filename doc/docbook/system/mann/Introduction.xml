      By default, the list will itemize GED commands if the man viewer is
      launched from MGED or Archer, and command line commands if the brlman
      program is run directly from the command line.  To specify a specific
      section of manual pages to list with brlman, use the -S option on the
      command line to specify 1, 3, 5 or n (with n being GED commands.)
