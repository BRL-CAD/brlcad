    <para>
      The <command>check</command> program computes and reports a variety of characteristics of the
      <emphasis remap="I">objects</emphasis> specified from the opened database.
      The characteristics which can be computed include <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">mass,
      centroid, moments of inertia, volume, overlaps, surface area, exposed air, gaps/voids,
      unconfined air</emphasis> and <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">adjacent air.
      </emphasis> Only the <emphasis remap="I">objects</emphasis> from the database specified on the
      command line are analyzed.
    </para>

    <para>
      It works by shooting grids of rays from the three axis-aligned directions (sometimes called
      <emphasis remap="I">views</emphasis>) or a single view when azimuth/elevation angles are mentioned.
    </para>

    <para>
      For volume/mass/surface area calculations the resulting calculations for each view are compared to
      each other. The grid of rays is progressively refined until the results from all three views
      agree within a user-specifiable tolerance, or a limit on grid refinement is reached.
    </para>

    <para>
      For mass/centroid/moments of inertia calculations it is suggested for better accuracy to opt
      for three axis-aligned grid by not mentioning azimuth/elevation angles.
    </para>

    <para>
      For surface area calculations, the rays are fired from three grids at random azimuth/elevation
      angles and then taken mean of the values reported by the three grids at the end.
    </para>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Detects air volumes which are next to each other but have different air_code values
	    applied to the region. This would typically indicate that the regions are different
	    types of air, such as crew_air (which fills the crew compartment of a vehicle) and
	    engine_air (which surrounds the engine). When these different types of air adjoin
	    each other, it is generally considered a modeling error.

      <varlistentry>
	<term><emphasis remap="B" role="bold">exp_air</emphasis></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This causes checks to be made to see if the ray encounters air regions before
	    (or after all) solid objects.  Typically, only the air inside a building or vehicle is
	    modeled if the purpose of the model is to support analysis of that single
	    structure/vehicle. There are exceptions, such as when modeling larger environments
	    for more extended analysis purposes.

      <varlistentry>
	<term><emphasis remap="B" role="bold">gap</emphasis></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This reports when there is more than overlap_tol_dist (see the -t option below)
	    between objects on the ray path. Note that not all gaps are errors. For example,
	    gaps between a wheel and a fender are expected (unless external air is modeled).
	    Typically, users should perform gap analysis on contained subsets of a model
	    (such as passenger compartments) rather than on whole vehicles.

	    This reports overlaps, when two regions occupy the same space. In the real world,
	    two objects may not occupy the same space. This check is sometimes also known as

    <para>
      If mass calculation is selected, a value is calculated and reported for each
      <emphasis remap="I">object</emphasis> specified on the command line.
      <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">Note that if there are overlaps or other errors in the
      geometry, the values reported will be invalid.</emphasis>
    </para>

    <para>
      For mass computation, the density of every region must be specified.
      Densities are specified as an index in a table of density values.
      This index is stored in the <emphasis remap="I">GIFTmater</emphasis>
      attribute of each region (typically set with the <emphasis remap="I">edcodes</emphasis>
      or <emphasis remap="I">adjust</emphasis> commands in MGED).
    </para>

    <para>
      The density table consists of three columns:

    <para>
      An example file might look like the following:
    </para>

    <literallayout class="normal">
<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../../../../misc/GQA_SAMPLE_DENSITIES" parse="text"/>
    </literallayout>

    <para>
      The table is typically created in an external file using a text editor.
    </para>

    <para>
      The geometry editor MGED automatically assigns an index value of
      <literal>1</literal> to a newly created region. While this default can be handy
      when a vast majority of objects are made from the same material, it can lead to
      surprising errors when objects which are supposed to have a
      certain mass are computed to have different mass because one or two regions
      were not set to the correct, non-default index value.  As a result, it is advised that
      the index value <literal>1</literal> never be used. If this practice is followed,
      then an error message will be generated for any regions which have not had their
      material index set to something other than the default.
    </para>

    <para>
      The user will typically want to run <command>gqa</command> and verify the results using the
      <option>-f</option> option (see below) before importing the table into the database.
      For example, if a material index is left out of the table, it is easier to rectify
      the situation using the external file. Once the table has been verified as correct
      and complete, it is imported to the database as the binary object
      <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">_DENSITIES</emphasis> .
      To import the text file into the database, the following command is used:
    </para>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Specifies a limit on how far the grid can be refined and optionally the initial spacing
	    between rays in the grids. The first value (if present) indicates the initial spacing
	    between grid rays.  The mandatory argument, <emphasis remap="I">grid_spacing_limit</emphasis>,
	    indicates a lower bound on how fine the grid spacing may get before computation is
	    terminated.  In general, the <emphasis remap="I">initial_grid_spacing</emphasis> value
	    should be an integer power of the <emphasis remap="I">grid_spacing_limit</emphasis>.  So
	    for example, if <emphasis remap="I">grid_spacing_limit</emphasis> has the value 1,
	    then any <emphasis remap="I">initial_grid_spacing</emphasis> specified should be in the
	    sequence 2, 4, 8, 16, 32... so that the grid will refine to precisely the lower limit.
	    The grid spacing may be specified with units.  For example:
	    <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">5 mm</emphasis> or
	    <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">10 in</emphasis> .  If units are not provided, millimeters
	    are presumed to be the units.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The default values are 50.0 mm and 0.5 mm, which is equivalent to specifying:
	    <option>-g 50.0mm-0.5mm</option> or <option>-g 50.0mm,0.5mm</option>
	    on the command line.  This is a hard limit.  If other analysis constraints are not
	    met, the grid spacing will never be refined smaller than the minimum grid size to
	    satisfy another constraint.  The initial grid spacing is divided in half at each
	    refinement step.  As a result, if you desire a lower limit to actually be tested, then
	    the initial grid size must be a power of 2 greater.  For example, specifying -g10mm,1mm
	    would result in grid spacings of 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25 being used.  If the goal was
	    to exactly end at a 1mm grid, then values such as 8 or 16 should have been
	    chosen for the initial values.  This would result in testing 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
	    grid spacing values.

	  <para>
	    Specifies a volumetric tolerance value that the three view computations must be within for
	    computation to complete.  If volume calculation is selected and this option is not set, then
	    the tolerance is set to 1/1,000 of the volume of the model bounding box. For large, complex objects
	    (such as entire vehicles), this value might need to be set larger to achieve reasonable
	    runtime (or even completion). Given the approximate sampling nature of the algorithm, the
	    three separate view computations will not usually produce identical results.
