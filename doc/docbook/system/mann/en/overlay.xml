  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>Plots the specified UNIX <emphasis>plot_file</emphasis> in the MGED display.
	Phony object names are created for each part of the plot file that is in a unique color.
	The names are created by adding a color to the specified <emphasis>name</emphasis>, or to
	“_PLOT_OVER” if no name is provided. The color suffix is built by converting the
	RGB color to a six-digit hex number. Each color corresponds to 2 hex digits, so that
	white becomes "ffffff," red becomes "ff0000," green is "00ff00," etc.
