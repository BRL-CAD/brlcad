  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>Lists all the primitive shapes currently drawn in the MGED display.
The <emphasis>level</emphasis> determines how much detail should be included in the list. For <emphasis>level</emphasis> zero
(the default), only a list of paths to shapes in the display list is produced. Each shape
is prefixed by “VIEW” or “-no-,” indicating that the shape is actually being drawn or
that it is being skipped, respectively.  If  <emphasis>level</emphasis> is greater than zero, the center, size,
ident number, RGB color assigned to the region, and the actual color used to draw the
shape are also listed.  If <emphasis>level</emphasis> is greater than one, the number of vlist structures and
the number of points in each vlist structure are also listed for each shape.  If <emphasis>level</emphasis> is
greater than two, then the actual lines drawn for each shape are also listed. The <command>who</command>
command performs a similar function, but lists only the top-level objects that are
displayed.
