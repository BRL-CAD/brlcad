  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>
    <command>wire</command> is a program to create a BRL-CAD database of solid
    wires or fuel lines.  The user enters the coordinates of the starting and 
    ending points of the different segments of wires along with the radius at each
    of these points.  Currently the program is limited to 10 segments.  This 
    number may be changed by changing the variable MAXSEG.  MAXSEG may be no greater 
    than 100 with out changing other parts of the program.  The wires are composed 
    of cones and spheres.  This program is designed to be run interactively.
