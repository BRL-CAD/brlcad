  <para>Lists the top-level objects that are currently displayed. The
<emphasis>phony</emphasis> flag asks for just <emphasis>phony</emphasis> objects. <emphasis>Phony</emphasis> objects are typically objects that are drawn in the MGED display, but are not actual database objects. Some <emphasis>phony</emphasis> objects
are drawings from the <command>vdraw</command> command and the edgeuses drawn by the <command>ev -u</command>
command. The <emphasis>real</emphasis> flag asks for just <emphasis>real</emphasis> objects, and the <emphasis>both</emphasis> flag asks for both <emphasis>real</emphasis> and <emphasis>phony</emphasis> objects. The default is just <emphasis>real</emphasis>objects. Any of the flags may be abbreviated by its first letter. The <command>x</command> command also lists displayed shapes, but in more detail.
