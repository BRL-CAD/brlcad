    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      Positions the center of the <emphasis>mged</emphasis> viewing cube at the specified
      model coordinates. This is accomplished by moving the eye position while not
      changing the viewing direction. (The <command>lookat</command> command performs a 
      related function by changing the viewing direction, but not moving the eye location.) 
      The coordinates are expected in the current editing units. In case the coordinates 
      are the result of evaluating a formula, they are echoed back. If no coordinates are 
      provided, the current center coordinates (in current editing units, not mm) are 
      printed and can be used in subsequent calculations.
    </para>
    <para>
      It is often convenient to use the center of the view when visually selecting key
      locations in the model for construction or animation because of (1) the visible
      centering dot on the screen, (2) the fact that zoom and rotation are performed with
      respect to the view center, (3) the default center-mouse behavior is to move the
      indicated point to the view center, and (4) the angle/distance cursors are centered by
      default. This command provides the means to set and retrieve those values
      numerically.

      The examples show the use of the <command>center</command> command to print 
      coordinates of the center of the mged display, move the center of the 
      <emphasis>mged</emphasis> display to a given point, set a Tcl variable to the 
      display center coodinates, move the center point a given distance
      in a given direction, and update a vertex in the database to be located at 
      the current center of view.
