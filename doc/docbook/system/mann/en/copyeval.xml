    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>Objects in a <emphasis>BRL-CAD</emphasis> model are stored as Boolean trees 
    (combinations), with the members being primitive shapes or other Boolean trees. Each 
    member has a transformation matrix associated with it. This arrangement allows a 
    primitive to be a member of a combination, and that combination may be a member of another
    combination, and so on. When a combination is displayed, the transformation
    matrices are applied to its members and passed down through the combinations to the
    leaf (primitive shape) level. The accumulated transformation matrix is then applied
    to the primitive before it is drawn on the screen. The <command>copyeval</command> command 
    creates a new primitive object called <emphasis>new_ primitive</emphasis> by applying the 
    transformation matrices accumulated along the <emphasis> path_to_old_primitive</emphasis> to 
    the leaf primitive shape object at the end of the path and saving the result under the name 
    <emphasis>new_ primitive.</emphasis> The <emphasis> path_to_old_ primitive </emphasis> must 
    be a legitimate path ending with a primitive shape.
