  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>Provides precise control over primitive editing operations that
	would normally be done using the mouse or knobs. For example, a shape rotate may
	be performed by selecting <emphasis>rotate</emphasis> from the primitive edit menu, then providing the
	rotation angles with the <command>p</command> command. A command of <command>p 0 30 0</command> would rotate 	the edited shape through 30° about the <emphasis>y</emphasis> axis. Similarly, many of the individual
  	parameters of the edited shape may be set exactly using the <command>p</command> command. If the <emphasis>	scale H</emphasis> menu item is selected while editing a TGC, then the <emphasis>value1</emphasis> supplied 	with a <command>p</command> command specifies the actual length of the height vector for that TGC. This 	method is the recommended technique to set precise values for shape parameters. The <command>translate	</command> and <command>rotobj</command> commands provide a similar capability for object editing.
