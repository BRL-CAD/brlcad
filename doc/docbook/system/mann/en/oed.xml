  <para>Places MGED directly into the matrix edit mode. The <emphasis>path_rhs</emphasis>
	must be a path to a primitive shape, and <emphasis>path_lhs</emphasis> must be a path to a combination 	that includes the first component of <emphasis>path_rhs</emphasis> as one of its members. The edited 	matrix will be the matrix in the final component of <emphasis>path_lhs</emphasis> that corresponds to 	the first component of <emphasis>path_rhs</emphasis>.  The last component in <emphasis>path_rhs 	</emphasis> is used as the reference shape during object editing.
