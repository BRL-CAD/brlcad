  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>“Pushes” the effects of transformation matrices in the paths,
from the specified <emphasis>object</emphasis> to the primitive shapes, into the shapes and replaces all the
transformation matrices with identity matrices. The <command>push</command> command performs a
similar function, but will refuse to make any changes if any shape needs to be
transformed into more than one location/orientation/scale. The <command>xpush</command> command will
recognize such situations and create extra copies of such shapes to accept the
different transformation effects. New shapes created by this command will have a suffix appended to the original name to make the new name unique. Combinations referring to the new shape will also be modified to reflect the name change. The <command>push</command> command performs the same function but will refuse to make any changes if it cannot
accomplish the “push” without creating any new shapes.

  <para>The example shows the use of the <command>xpush</command> command to move all the effects of the transformation matrices in a tree rooted at an object down to the shape level(creating new shapes if needed).
