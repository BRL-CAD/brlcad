      Performs the operations indicated in the <emphasis>Boolean_formula </emphasis> and
      stores the result in <emphasis>new_obj</emphasis>. The <emphasis>new_obj</emphasis> 
      will be stored as an NMG shape (it may be converted to a polysolid by using the 
      <command>nmg_simplify</command> command). If the -t option is specified, then the 
      resulting object will consist entirely of triangular facets. The
      default is to allow facets of any complexity, including holes. The <emphasis>-P</emphasis> 
      option specifies the number of CPUs to use for the calculation (however, this is 
      currently ignored). Only simple <emphasis> Boolean_formulas </emphasis> are allowed. 
      No parentheses are allowed and the operations are performed from left to right with 
      no precedence. More complex expressions must be expressed as BRL-CAD objects using 
      the <command>r</command>, <command>g</command>, or <command>c</command>commands and 
      evaluated using the <command>facetize</command> or <command>ev</command> commands.
