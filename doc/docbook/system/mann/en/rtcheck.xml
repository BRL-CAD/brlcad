  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>Executes the BRL-CAD <emphasis>rtcheck</emphasis> program with the default
options of "-s50  M." The -M option tells <emphasis>rtcheck</emphasis> to read the viewing parameters from standard input so that rays are only fired from the current view. The current
database name and the list of currently displayed objects are added to the end of the
<emphasis>rtcheck</emphasis> command line. The <emphasis>rtcheck</emphasis> program is written such that options may be repeated, and the last occurrence of an option will override any earlier occurrences.  This allows the user to specify other <emphasis>size (-s)</emphasis> options. The <command>rrt</command> command performs a similar function, but may be used to execute other programs as well. The <emphasis>rtcheck</emphasis> program uses raytracing to check for overlapping regions in the list of objects passed on the command line. When invoked from within MGED, any discovered overlaps along a ray are represented as yellow lines that extend only in the areas of overlap. Details and a count of overlaps are also reported. Note that overlaps of less than 0.1 mm are currently ignored by <emphasis>rtcheck</emphasis>. The default option of <emphasis>-s50</emphasis> indicates that the checking rays should be fired from a uniform square grid with 50 rays on a side. This is very coarse and may miss significant overlaps. It is recommended that the user select appropriate options for the <emphasis>rtcheck</emphasis> program and execute it for a variety viewing aspects to perform a thorough check. The granularity of the grid may be controlled with the <emphasis>-s, -w, -n, -g,</emphasis> and <emphasis>-G</emphasis> options. See the <emphasis>man</emphasis> page on <emphasis>rtcheck</emphasis> for details.
