    <para>
      Concatenates an existing <emphasis> BRL-CAD </emphasis> database to the
      database currently being edited. If a <emphasis> prefix</emphasis> is 
      supplied, then all objects from the <emphasis>database_file</emphasis> 
      will have <emphasis> prefix </emphasis> added to the beginning of their
      names. Note that each <emphasis> BRL-CAD</emphasis> object must have a unique 
      name, so care must be taken not to "dbconcat" a  database that has objects 
      with names the same as objects in the current database. 	The <command>dup</command> 
      command may be used to check for duplicate names. If the <command>dup</command> 
      command finds duplicate names, use the <emphasis>prefix</emphasis> option to both the 
      <command>dup</command> 	and <command>dbconcat</command> commands to find a 
      <emphasis>prefix</emphasis> that produces no duplicates.	If duplicate names 
      are encountered during the "dbconcat" process, computer-generated prefixes
      will be added to the object names coming from the <emphasis>database_file</emphasis> 
      (but member names appearing in combinations will not be modified, so this is a 
      dangerous practice and should be avoided).

    <para>
      The example shows the use of the <command>dbconcat</command> command to copy all objects in a particular
      database to the current database. It also shows how to add a particular prefix to every object copied.

      <para>
	Copies all the objects in <emphasis>model_two.g</emphasis> to the current database,
	but prefixes the name of every object copied with the string <emphasis>two_</emphasis>.
