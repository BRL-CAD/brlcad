    <para>
      Builds a region from existing solids that have specifically formatted names 
      based on the provided tags and numbers. The created region will be named "tag.rx,"
      where "x" is the first number (starting from 1) that produces an unused region 
      name. If the <emphasis>-a</emphasis> option is used, then the specified
      "region_num" will be used for "x." If that region already exists, this operation will
      append the new geometry to the existing region definition. If that region does not 
      exist, a new one will be created. The solids that will be involved in this operation 
      are those with names of the form "tag.s#" or "tag.s#o@," where "#" is a number 
      between <emphasis>start_num</emphasis> and <emphasis>end_num</emphasis> inclusive, 
      "o" is either "u," "-," or "+," and "@" is any number.
      The operators and numbers coded into the solid names are used to build the region.
