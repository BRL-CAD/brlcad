  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>Saves the current viewing parameters in the specified <emphasis>file</emphasis>
	in the form of a shell script that will run the BRL-CAD <emphasis>rt</emphasis> program as if it had been
	executed from within MGED using the <command>rt -s512</command> command.  Any <emphasis>args</emphasis> 	included on the <command>saveview</command> command line will be copied to the <emphasis>file</emphasis> as 	options to the <emphasis>rt</emphasis> program. If the <emphasis>file</emphasis> already exists, the script 	will be appended to it. This is useful in setting up images to be raytraced later. The default script 	produced by "saveview test.rt" looks like:</para>

<blockquote>
<literallayout>
#!/bin/sh
rt -M \
 -o test.rt.pix\
 $*\
 model.g\
 'object1' 'object2' \
 2>> test.rt.log\
 &lt;&lt;EOF

start 0; clean;
end;
EOF
</literallayout>
</blockquote>  
<para> When this script is executed, the image will be stored in <emphasis>test.rt.pix</emphasis>, and all 	messages and errors generated by the <emphasis>rt</emphasis> program will be stored in <emphasis>test.rt.log	</emphasis>. The above script will produce an image of <emphasis>object1</emphasis> and <emphasis>object2	</emphasis> from the BRL-CAD database named <emphasis>model.g</emphasis>. The <emphasis>viewsize</emphasis>, 	<emphasis>orientation</emphasis>, and <emphasis>eye_pt</emphasis> parameters reproduce the view displayed by 	MGED when the <command>saveview</command> command was executed. The presence of “$*” in the script causes 	any additional command-line options given when the script is invoked to be interpreted as additional 	<emphasis>rt</emphasis> options. Typically, a “-s” option might be used to set the image size (the default 	is 512 pixels square). See the <emphasis>man</emphasis> page on <emphasis>rt</emphasis> for details on 	available options.
</para>

<para>If you have a <emphasis>saveview</emphasis> script and wish to change MGED to that view, merely cut-and-
	paste, or <emphasis>source</emphasis>, the viewsize, orientation, and eye_pt lines from the <emphasis>	saveview</emphasis> file into MGED.
</para>

<para>Related MGED commands are <command>preview</command>, for viewing the effects of an entire animation
	script, and <command>savekey</command>.  Related BRL-CAD programs are <emphasis>tabsub</emphasis> and 	<emphasis>tabinterp</emphasis>.
