  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>Permutes the vertex labels for the face of an ARB shape
	that is currently being edited. The <emphasis>tuple</emphasis> indicates which face is affected and also
	indicates the desired result. The tuple is formed by concatenating the list of vertex
	numbers for the face in the order desired such that the first vertex listed will become
	vertex number one (and therefore the default keypoint). Only a sufficient number of
	vertices to disambiguate need be included in the tuple. Note that this has no effect on
	the geometry of the ARB, but may affect any texture mapping involving this shape.
