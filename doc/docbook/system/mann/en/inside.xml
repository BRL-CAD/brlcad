<refsection xml:id="description"><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

  <para>Creates a new shape that is <emphasis>inside</emphasis> an existing shape. This
	command is typically used to create an <emphasis>inside</emphasis> shape that can be subtracted from the
	original shape to produce a hollow shell. The command is typically used with no
	arguments, and it prompts the user for all needed information; however, all the
	parameters may be supplied on the command line. If MGED is in primitive edit
	mode when the <command>inside</command> command is issued, then the shape currently being edited
	will be used as the <emphasis>outside_shape</emphasis>.  Similarly, if MGED is in matrix edit mode when
	the <command>inside</command> command is executed, then the current key shape will be used as the
	outside shape.
   </para>

  <para>The first example shows the use of the <command>inside</command> command to create a shape inside 	another shape such that all its faces are 1 unit from the corresponding faces of the outside shape. The 	second example shows the use of the <command>inside</command> command to create a shape inside the current 	key shape or the shape currently being edited. The faces of the new shape will be 1 unit from the 	corresponding faces of the current outside shape.
