  <para>
    Applies a scaling factor to an object or view. When passed one parameter,
    an "object or view" is applied a uniform scale factor. When passed three
    parameters, an "object" is applied a unique scale factor to each axis. The
    effect is determined by the Transform option in the Settings menu. This is
    normally affected by the current mode of operation in MGED (e.g., matrix
    edit, primitive edit, or viewing).
  </para>

  <para>
    NOTE: Three parameters can only be applied in "matrix edit" mode. Only
    scale pipe and tori primitives uniformly otherwise raytracer and other
    errors may occur.

    <para>
      In matrix edit mode, the object being affected will get twice as big. In
      view mode, the size of the view will be doubled (showing twice the volume
      of space, hence making objects appear half their previous size on the
      display).
