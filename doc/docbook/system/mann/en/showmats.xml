  <para>Lists the transformation matrices encountered along the

	member occurs more than once in a combination along the path, then a matrix will be
	listed for each occurrence of that member, and the accumulated matrix will only use
	the first occurrence. Related commands are <command>putmat, copymat,</command> and <command>listeval	</command>.
