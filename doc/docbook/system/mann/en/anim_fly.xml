    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      This filter is designed to simulate the motion of an airplane.
      Given a four-column table specifying the desired 3D position of the
      airplane at each relevant time step, <command>anim_fly</command>
      produces a seven-column file which also includes the orientation 
      of the plane in terms of yaw, pitch, and roll. The yaw and pitch 
      are manipulated so that the plane faces the direction of motion, 
      while the roll is used to do banking.

	<term><option>-f#</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This option specifies a factor to control the severity of the banking.
	    The best factor is a subjective decision; a good starting point can best
	    be obtained by using the <option> -b</option> option. Animations representing aircraft
	    of different scales will need different factors.
	    If the slightest curve throws the plane into a 90-degree bank, the factor is
	    too large; if it doesn't bank enough, the factor is too small. The size
	    of the best factor varies inversely with the size of the imagined
	    aircraft plane. If a factor of 0 is used, there will be no banking. This would be 
	    appropriate for animating a ground vehicle.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>-b#</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This option is used to estimate a good value for the <option>-f</option> option. The
	    parameter is the maximum desired banking angle. <command>Anim_fly</command> then computes
	    the factor necessary to keep the banking below the specified angle. This
	    value is returned instead of <command>anim_fly</command>'s usual output.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>-r</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Suppress vertical loop smoothing.  A special case occurs if the aircraft is to perform a vertical
	    loop. Normally, the algorithm likes to keep the aircraft right-side up. This would cause the 
	    airplane to do an instantaneous 180-degree roll as it hits the vertical portion of the loop. 
	    To counter this, a capability was built in which prevents this sudden roll, allowing the aircraft to go
	    upside-down in a loop situation. This feature can be suppressed with the
	    <option>-r</option> flag.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>-p</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Specify the ratio of input rows to output rows, which must be an integer. The default, of course, 
	    is one. The accuracy of the output depends on having a large number of input lines, which is not 
	    usually a problem in animations, which require a large number of frames per
	    second, anyway. If a test animation with a small number of frames per
	    second is being created, the user should still use an input table
	    with a high number of input rows, reducing the frequency of the output
	    with the <option>-p</option> option. For example, if <emphasis remap='B' role='B'>in.table</emphasis>
	    contains 30 rows for each second of the animation, then the command:
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <userinput>anim_fly -f0.001 -p10 &lt; in.table &gt; out.table</userinput>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    would produce an animation table containing 3 rows for each second of the animation.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>-s</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Specify the minimum step size for the discrete-time differentiation. At any
	    given point on the flight path, the yaw, pitch, and roll are calculated based
	    on a past point, the current point, and a future point. Normally,
	    these are consecutive points from the input table. If the time
	    difference between the points falls below a certain threshold,
	    then non-consecutive points are used to avoid
	    numerical instability. The default time threshhold is 0.1 seconds; this
	    can be raised or lowered using the <option>-s</option> option.
	    Try raising the threshold if the output orientations experience random
	    jitter.
