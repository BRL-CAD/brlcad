  <para>Forces the effects of all transformation matrices that appear in
	any combinations in the trees from the specified <emphasis>objects</emphasis> down to the primitive 	shapes. This will change the parameters of the <emphasis>primitive shapes</emphasis> if any of the 	transformation matrices are not identity matrices. All the transformation matrices visited will be set to 	identity matrices. This command will fail, and no changes will be made, if any primitive shape referenced 	by the list of <emphasis>objects</emphasis> is positioned differently in two or more <emphasis>	combinations</emphasis>. The <command>xpush</command> command will perform a similar function, even if 	some shapes are multiply referenced.
