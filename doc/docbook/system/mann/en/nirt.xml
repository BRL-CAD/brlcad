  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>Runs the NIRT program that is distributed with BRL-CAD to
intersect a single ray with the displayed objects.  By default, NIRT is run using the
current database and the currently displayed objects, and it uses the current eye point
as the ray start point and the current viewing direction as the ray direction. This
effectively fires a ray at the center of the MGED display. The resulting collection of
intersections between the ray and the objects is listed.  Additional arguments may be
supplied on the <command>nirt</command> command line. See the <emphasis>man</emphasis>page 
of <command>nirt</command> for more details.
