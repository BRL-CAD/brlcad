  <para>Adjusts the current view in MGED such that the eye is
	looking in the direction of the given coordinates, but does not move the eye point nor
	change the view size. This is similar to just rotating the viewers head to look at the
	specified point, putting that point in the center of the MGED display. The center
	command performs a similar function, but moves the eye_pt without changing the
	viewing direction.
