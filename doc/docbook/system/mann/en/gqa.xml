  <refsection xml:id="description"><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>
      The <command>gqa</command> program computes and reports a variety of characteristics of the
      <emphasis remap="I">objects</emphasis> specified from the given
      <emphasis remap="I">model.g</emphasis> geometric description.
      The characteristics which can be computed include
      <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">weight, volume, overlaps, exposed air, gaps/voids,</emphasis>
      and <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">adjacent air.</emphasis> Only the
      <emphasis remap="I">objects</emphasis> from the database specified on the command line are
      analyzed.
    </para>

    <para>
      It works by shooting grids of rays from the three axis-aligned directions (sometimes called
      <emphasis remap="I">views</emphasis>).
    </para>

    <para>
      For volume/weight calculations the resulting calculations for each view are compared to
      each other. The grid of rays is progressively refined until the results from all three views
      agree within a user-specifiable tolerance, or a limit on grid refinement is reached.
    </para>

    <para>
      For error and interface calculations, the grid is refined until an error is found or the
      grid refinement limit is reached.
    </para>

    <para>
      When multiple calculations are performed, the most extensive path is taken.
      For example, if weight and overlap calculations are performed, then the grid
      will be refined until the refinement limit is reached, or an overlap is
      detected.
    </para>
  </refsection>

  <refsection xml:id="volume_and_weight_calculation"><title>VOLUME AND WEIGHT CALCULATION</title>

    <para>
      If volume or weight calculation is selected, a value is calculated and reported
      for each <emphasis remap="I">object</emphasis> specified on the command line.
      <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">Note that if there are overlaps or other errors in the
      geometry, the values reported will be invalid.</emphasis>
    </para>

    <para>
      For weight computation, the density of every region must be specified.
      Densities are specified as an index in a table of density values.
      This index is stored in the <emphasis remap="I">GIFTmater</emphasis>
      attribute of each region (typically set with the <emphasis remap="I">edcodes</emphasis>
      or <emphasis remap="I">adjust</emphasis> commands in MGED).
    </para>

    <para>
      The density table consists of three columns:
    </para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><emphasis>An integer index value.</emphasis></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This is the value to which the <emphasis remap="I">GIFTmater</emphasis> attribute
	    will be set to select this material for the region.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><emphasis>A floating point density value.</emphasis></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This is the density for the material, and is specified in
	    <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">grams/cc</emphasis>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	  This is a name or description the material.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>
      An example file might look like the following:
    </para>

    <literallayout class="normal">
<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../../../../../misc/GQA_SAMPLE_DENSITIES" parse="text"/>
   </literallayout>

    <para>
      The table is typically created in an external file using a text editor.
    </para>

    <para>
      The geometry editor MGED automatically assigns an index value of
      <literal>1</literal> to a newly created region. While this default can be handy
      when a vast majority of objects are made from the same material, it can lead to
      surprising errors when objects which are supposed to have a
      certain weight are computed to have different weight because one or two regions
      were not set to the correct, nondefault index value.  As a result, it is advised that
      the index value <literal>1</literal> never be used. If this practice is followed,
      then an error message will be generated for any regions which have not had their
      material index set to something other than the default.
    </para>

    <para>
      The user will typically want to run <command>gqa</command> and verify the results using the
      <option>-f</option> option (see below) before importing the table into the database.
      For example, if a material index is left out of the table, it is easier to rectify
      the situation using the external file. Once the table has been verified as correct
      and complete, it is imported to the database as the binary object
      <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">_DENSITIES</emphasis>.
      To import the text file into the database, the following command is used:
    </para>

    <para>
      <prompt>mged&gt; </prompt><userinput>bo -i u c _DENSITIES <replaceable>filename</replaceable></userinput>
    </para>
  </refsection>

  <refsection xml:id="geometry_error_detection"><title>GEOMETRY ERROR DETECTION</title>

    <para>
      All of these calculations run until an error is detected, or until the grid
      refinement limit is reached.
    </para>
  </refsection>

  <refsection xml:id="overlap_detection"><title>OVERLAP DETECTION</title>

    <para>
      For each pair of regions that overlap, the tool reports the two regions that
      overlap, the maximum line-of-sight thickness of the overlap, and the in-hit location
      of the ray that caused that maximum overlap thickness.
    </para>
    <para>
      Other analyses in the error detection category behave in a similar manner.
    </para>

	  </para>

	  <para>
	    <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">Adjacent different air (a):</emphasis>
	    Detects air volumes which are next to each other but have different
	    air_code values applied to the region. This would typically indicate
	    that the regions are different types of air, such as crew_air (which
	    fills the crew compartment of a vehicle) and engine_air (which surrounds the engine).
	    When these different types of air adjoin each other, it is generally considered
	    a modeling error.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">Bounding box dimensions (b):</emphasis>
	    Reports the dimensions of an axis-aligned box which fully encloses the
	    <emphasis remap="I">objects</emphasis>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">Exposed air (e):</emphasis>
	    This causes checks to be made to see if the ray encounters air regions before
	    (or after all) solid objects. It also checks to see if the ray moves
	    from a void to an air region. Typically, only the air inside a building or
	    vehicle is modeled if the purpose of the model is to support analysis of
	    that single structure/vehicle.  There are exceptions, such as when modeling
	    larger environments for more extended analysis purposes.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">Gaps/voids (g):</emphasis>
	    This reports when there is more than <emphasis remap="I">overlap_tol_dist</emphasis>
	    (see the <option>-t</option> option below) between objects on the ray path.  Note
	    that not all gaps are errors.  For example, gaps between a wheel and a fender are
	    expected (unless external air is modeled).  Typically, users should perform gap
	    analysis on contained subsets of a model (such as passenger compartments)
	    rather than on whole vehicles.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">Overlaps (o):</emphasis>
	    are two regions which occupy the same space.  In the real world, two objects may
	    not occupy the same space.  This check is sometimes also known as
	    <emphasis remap="I">interference checking</emphasis>.  Two objects must overlap
	    by at least <emphasis remap="I">overlap_tol_dist</emphasis> (see the
	    <option>-t</option> option below) to be considered to overlap.  Overlap testing
	    causes the grid spacing to be refined until the limit is reached, or an overlap
	    is detected. See the <option>-g</option> option below for details on setting the
	    grid spacing. Once overlaps have been detected, grid refinement is not done, and
	    processing stops.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">Visualize Overlaps (p):</emphasis>
	    In MGED, if overlaps are detected, this option causes the overlaps found to be

	<term><option>-g </option><emphasis remap="I">[initial_grid_spacing-]grid_spacing_limit</emphasis></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Specifies a limit on how far the grid can be refined and optionally the initial spacing
	    between rays in the grids. The first value (if present) indicates the initial spacing
	    between grid rays.  The mandatory argument, "<emphasis remap="I">grid_spacing_limit</emphasis>,"
	    indicates a lower bound on how fine the grid spacing may get before computation is
	    terminated.  In general, the <emphasis remap="I">initial_grid_spacing</emphasis> value
	    should be an integer power of the <emphasis remap="I">grid_spacing_limit</emphasis>.  So
	    for example, if <emphasis remap="I">grid_spacing_limit</emphasis> has the value 1,
	    then any <emphasis remap="I">initial_grid_spacing</emphasis> specified should be in the
	    sequence 2, 4, 8, 16, 32... so that the grid will refine to precisely the lower limit.
	    The grid spacing may be specified with units.  For example:
	    <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">5 mm</emphasis> or
	    <emphasis remap="B" role="bold">10 in.</emphasis>  If units are not provided, millimeters
	    are presumed to be the units.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>


    <para>
      The default values are 50.0 mm and 0.5 mm, which is equivalent to specifying:
      <option>-g 50.0mm-0.5mm</option> or <option>-g 50.0mm,0.5mm</option>
      on the command line.  This is a hard limit.  If other analysis constraints are not
      met, the grid spacing will never be refined smaller than the minimum grid size to
      satisfy another constraint.  The initial grid spacing is divided in half at each
      refinement step.  As a result, if you desire a lower limit to actually be tested, then
      the initial grid size must be a power of 2 greater.  For example, specifying -g10mm,1mm
      would result in grid spacings of 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25 being used.  If the goal was
      to exactly end at a 1mm grid, then values such as 8 or 16 should have been
      chosen for the initial values.  This would result in testing 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
      grid spacing values.

	    Specifies a volumetric tolerance value that the three view computations must be within for
	    computation to complete.  If volume calculation is selected and this option is not set, then
	    the tolerance is set to 1/10,000 of the volume of the model. For large, complex objects
	    (such as entire vehicles), this value might need to be set larger to achieve reasonable
	    runtimes (or even completion). Given the approximate sampling nature of the algorithm, the
	    three separate view computations will not usually produce identical results.

	    This is like the volume tolerance, <option>-T</option>, but is applied to the weight
	    computation results, not the volume computation results.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The weight computation tolerance is probably more appropriate when doing whole-vehicle analysis.
	    If weight computation is selected, it is set to a value equal to the weight of an object 1/100
	    the size of the model, which is made of the most dense material in the table.

    <example><title>Specifying Grid and Target Objects</title>

      <para>
	The following will check objects hull, turret, and suspension for overlaps
	and report exposed air. The grid starts at 1 cm and is refined to 1 mm unless overlaps or
	exposed air are detected before the grid is refined to 1 mm.

    <example><title>Specifying Using Non-Default Units</title>

      <para>
	The following computes volume and weight of hull, turret, and suspension.  Results are
	reported in cubic centimeters (cc) and ounces (oz).  The grid spacing starts at 5 in. and
	will not be refined below 0.3 mm spacing.
