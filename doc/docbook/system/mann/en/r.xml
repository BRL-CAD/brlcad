  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>Creates a region with the specified <emphasis>region_name</emphasis>.
	The <emphasis>region</emphasis> is constructed using the list of Boolean <emphasis>operations</emphasis> 	and <emphasis>object</emphasis>pairs. The operators are represented by the single characters “+,” “-,” 	and “u” for intersection, subtraction, and union, respectively. The <emphasis>object</emphasis> 	associated with each operator may be a combination or a primitive shape. No parentheses or any grouping 	indication is allowed in the <command>r</command> command. The operator hierarchy for the <command>r 	</command> command has been established through the ancestry of BRL-CAD and does not conform to accepted 	standards (see the <command>c</command> command for a more standard implementation). Intersection and 	subtraction operations are performed first, proceeding left to right; then union operations are 	performed. BRL-CAD regions are special cases of BRL-CAD <emphasis>combinations</emphasis> and include 	special attributes. Default values for these attributes may be set using the <command>regdef</command> 	command. As new <emphasis>regions</emphasis> are built, the default ident number gets incremented. If 	<emphasis>region_name</emphasis> already exists, then the <emphasis>operation/object</emphasis> pairs 	get appended to its end.

    <para>Creates a region named <emphasis>new_region</emphasis> that consists of two parts unioned together. The
	first part is <emphasis>shape1</emphasis> with <emphasis>shape2</emphasis> subtracted. The second part is 	the intersection of <emphasis>shape3</emphasis> and the combination <emphasis>group4</emphasis>.
