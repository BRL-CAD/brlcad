This archive is a repackaged copy of docbook-xsl-ns-1.76.1.tar.bz2
from http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/docbook-xsl-ns/

The filename will remain docbook-xsl-ns.tar.bz2 to simplify
build logic - this README file and the commit logs should
document the current version.  The tarball is set up to extract
to the directory xsl to allow the CMake build logic to place
the files correctly.
