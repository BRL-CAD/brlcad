Y14.5M-2009.ttf & WeldSymbols.ttf

Copyright 2010 Peter Kanold These fonts are public domain freeware - copying &
redistributing it is encouraged.  You may use them in what ever personal or
commercial way you would like. Credit to me if it is used in a commercial
package would be nice but is not mandatory.

This font follows the guideline of the ASME Y14.5M-2009 technical
specification. Rather than reverse engineering this font you would likely be
better off just going right to the standard for the complete font details.

The font is specifically designed for use in geometric dimensioning &
tolerancing. It is capable of producing both boxed (basic) & unboxed feature
control frames.  It includes some rudimentary surface finish and welding
symbols as well.

Be aware that some programs allow only characters with ASCII values of 255 or
less. Because of this I created the WeldSymbols.ttf font. It has the welding
symbols with ASCII values of 255 or less.

The font uses some unusual metrics to create boxes around characters. Rather
than using separate characters for boxed and unboxed letters, the font uses
special characters to box the preceding letter.  The special characters are
“_” [low line], “~” [tilda] and “`” [accent grave]. There are other characters
that control the start, transition and end of boxed characters these include
“{” [left curly bracket] , “|” [vertical line] ,”}” [right curly bracket] ,
”æ” [latin ae] ”ç” [latin c with cedilla] , ”è” [latin e with grave] among
others.
