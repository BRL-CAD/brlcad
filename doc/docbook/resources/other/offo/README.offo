This is the external offo hyphenation package, version 2.0, which is
used by the BRL-CAD package for Apache fop, version 1.0 or greater.

For more information see http://offo.sourceforge.net/

BRL-CAD only uses offo when Apache FOP 1.0 or greater is available -
the overhead of supporting older FOP versions in terms of increased
complexity and download time is not worth it. In such cases the default
FOP behavior is used.
