      Licenses of FOP XML Hyphenation Patterns

The project ‘Objects For Formatting Objects’ (OFFO) hosts hyphenation
pattern files in the XML format used by the Formatting Object Processor
Apache Fop <http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/>. All files were obtained
by conversion of existing hyphenation pattern files for the typesetting
program TeX. The hyphenation pattern files come with a variety of
licenses, according to the license of the TeX hyphenation pattern file
from which they are derived. All files hosted by the OFFO project come
with an OSI-approved Open Source license, or were placed in the Public
Domain by their authors. Below we list for each hyphenation pattern file
the applicable license, and we provide a link to the text of the
license. It is the responsibility of the user to read the license
carefully and decide whether the intended usage complies with it. If it
does not for one or more hyphenation pattern files, you cannot use those
files. This is especially important if you intend to include the files
with a distributed (software) package, or if you intend to use the files
in a commercial application. See FOP's audit page
<http://wiki.apache.org/xmlgraphics-fop/FOPAudits/March2003>, section
'Hyphenation pattern issues', in the FOP Wiki for additional information.
