NOTE:  before going this deep, start with "dm set debug #" to follow
the libdm level function calls.



When comparing the OpenGL behavior of two programs, the tool apitrace
is quite useful (https://github.com/apitrace/apitrace)

The following steps allow for comparison between traces from MGED and qdm:

apitrace trace ./bin/mged share/db/moss.g
apitrace dump mged.trace > mged.log
cut -f1 -d" " --complement mged.log > mged_trimmed.log

apitrace trace ./bin/qdm share/db/moss.g
apitrace dump qdm.trace > qdm.log
cut -f1 -d" " --complement qdm.log > qdm_trimmed.log

(The trimming step strips the leading numbers from the logs, which
otherwise render comparisons with diff impractical.)

Comparison is still not trivial - Qt does a lot of work "under the hood"
to manage OpenGL, which will manifest in OpenGL calls not visible in an
MGED trace.  It is necessary to identify the common logic blocks between
the two programs corresponding to similar operations and look in those
areas for significant differences.


Note that if a dm issue involves digging in to memory usage, there are a number
of profiling tools to use for introspection.  See, for example:
