BRL-CAD on Max OS X README
==========================

Being that this is one of the newest architectures to be added and
officially supported, there are some issues to keep in mind with the
installation when building from the sources.  Beyond the notes
provided here, building on Mac OS X can generally be considered the
same as the UNIX, BSD, and Linux platforms.

CMake
-----------------
Kitware provides Mac OSX compilations of CMake:

http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html


X11 Window Server
-----------------
You'll need to install an X11 server if you would like to build Tk and
have a graphical user interface.  Apple's X11 is the recommended X
Window Server, but XQuartz should work too and is often newer than the
official Apple version:  http://xquartz.macosforge.org

Supported Versions
------------------
BRL-CAD is generally only "extensively" tested by the developers on
the latest released version of Mac OS X.  That is to say that
although the BRL-CAD package should build on prior versions of the Mac
OS X operating system, they are generally and eventually not
maintained and will require additional effort to obtain a build.
Compiling on 10.3 or 10.4 should complete successfully.  Due to a
variety of significant application programming interface issues in
early releases of Mac OS X, versions prior to 10.2 are unsupported.

Parallel Builds
---------------
As many workstation and server systems shipped by Apple are
multiprocessor systems, you can enjoy the benefits of decreased
compile times by utilizing the "-j" option to make.  After running
configure, run "make -j2" to build on a 2-processor system.

Universal Builds
----------------

Universal builds have not been fully vetted due to how BRL-CAD
serializes data to disk. BRL-CAD's CMake logic is not currently
set up to support this type of build, but plans to in the future.

CMake and Mac OSX
-----------------

On a default configuration, CMake has some problems performing parallel
builds on OSX - typically this will manifest itself as a series of
"too many open files" errors.  So far, the way to work around this in
OSX 10.5 is to set the following system control variables to 50,000:

kern.maxfiles
kern.maxfilesperproc

(check the current values using "sysctl <variable>" on the command line)

and up the maxfiles limit in /etc/launchd.conf:

limit maxfiles 50000 unlimited

This is not widely tested, and OSX has quite a few limit settings that
may or may not apply (and may change from one version to the next.)  As
we get a better feel for various platforms we can assemble a table of
required settings.  Other programs have this issue as well, so searching
online may prove fruitful.

So far, if parallel building doesn't work due to the above issue a
non-parallel build will still succeed.  Another workaround is to build
just subdirectories (e.g. src/other, doc, etc.) individually and then
do a toplevel make in non-parallel mode to finalize the build.

OpenSceneGraph and OSX
----------------------
For 32bit OSX builds of an X11+OpenSceneGraph BRL-CAD:
cmake .. -DBRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS=BUNDLED -DBRLCAD_ENABLE_OSG=ON
-DBRLCAD_REGEX=SYSTEM -DBRLCAD_WORD_SIZE=32BIT -DOSG_WINDOWING_SYSTEM=X11


Tips
----

If you need to get information about your machine and OSX version, try
these commands:

sw_vers -productVersion
uname -a

Bugs
----
The only known bugs specific to Mac OS X are limitations of Tk or the
X11 event handler that our generally outside of BRL-CAD's domain.
Refer to BUGS for more general details on known bugs and reporting
mechanisms.
