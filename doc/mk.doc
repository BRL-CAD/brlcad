mk_bolt
.fi
.ft R
This program creates an mged data base of bolts.  There are four types
of bolts that can be created but only one type can be in the data base
at a time.  The four types of bolts that may be created are listed
below.

.in -0.5i
Up to twenty-six bolts may be created in one data base.  The user may
run this program interactively or he may specify options on a command
line.
.sp 2

.nf
mk_handle
.fi
.ft R
This program creates up to twenty-six handles of one size and places
them in a new mged data base.  The handles are composed of three
cylinders, two tori, and two arb8s.  The top of the handle and the sides
are composed of cylinders.  The two bends in the handles are made by
using tori.  The arb8s define which part of the tori are to be used.
This program may be run interactively or the user may specify options
on a command line.
.sp 2

.nf
mk_window
.fi
.ft R
This program creates an mged data base containing up to twenty-six
windows of the same size.  The window is rectangular in shape with
rounded corners.  The user may run the program interactively or he
may specify options on the command line.
.sp 2
.ft B
.nf
mk_winfrm
.fi
.ft R
This program creates an mged data base of window frames.  Up to twenty-
six window frames of the same size my be created.  The window frame
is rectangular in shape with rounded corners.  Again, this program may
be run interactively or the user may specify options on the command
line.
.sp 2

.nf
mk_gastank
.fi
.ft R
This program creates a solid gas tank with rounded corners.  The object
is appropriate for use with radar signature models.  It is not appropriate
for infra red models or vulnerability models since the tank is solid.
Again, this program will create
up to twenty-six gas tanks of the same size and place them in a new mged
data base.  The user may run the program interactively or he may specify
options on the command line.
.sp 2
.ft B
.nf
mk_wire
.fi
.ft R
This program is used to create up to ten solid wire or fuel segments
by entering
the starting and ending points of each segment and the radius at these
points.  The maximum number of segments may be extended to 100 by changing
the variable MAXSEG.
