BRL-CAD is a powerful open-source cross-platform solid modeling system that includes interactive geometry editing, high-performance ray-tracing for rendering and geometric analysis, image and signal-processing tools, a system performance analysis benchmark suite, and libraries for robust geometric manipulation.

For more than 40 years, BRL-CAD has been a primary solid modeling system used by the U.S. military to model weapons systems for vulnerability and lethality analyses.

== Key Features

* **CSG Modeling:** Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) provides precise Boolean operations on primitives.
* **High Performance:** Multi-threaded ray-tracing and a high-performance memory allocator.
* **Hybrid Representation:** Supports both CSG and B-Rep (NURBS) geometry.
* **Extensive Toolset:** Over 400 specialized command-line utilities for geometry processing.
* **Legacy of Stability:** Proven in production environments since 1979.

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites
To build BRL-CAD from source, you will need:
* **CMake** (3.14+)
* **C/C++ Compiler** (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
* **Build Tools** (Make, Ninja, or Visual Studio)

=== Quick Build (Unix/macOS)
[source,bash]
----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(nproc)
----

== Documentation

We are currently transitioning our extensive documentation (Docbook/XML + MediaWiki + troff + text + ...) to an **Antora-powered ecosystem**.

* **Tutorials:** link:{docs-url}/tutorials[Browse the Manuals]
* **Developer Guides:** link:{docs-url}/hacking and link:{repo-url}/blob/main/HACKING
* **Wiki:** {project-url}/wiki[snapshot that is a little out of date]
* **Etc:** link:{docs-url}[Not everything, but a lot]

== Contributing

BRL-CAD is a community-driven project. We welcome contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests, code, and documentation.

1. **Chat with Us:** Connect with us on Zulip link:{chat-url}.
2. **Find Issues:** Check our link:{repo-url}/issues[Issue Tracker].
3. **Submit a PR:** We follow a standard Fork-and-Pull Request workflow.

[IMPORTANT]
.Documentation Contributors
We're prototyping the use of **AsciiDoc** for all project documentation in a separate "docs" repo.

== License

BRL-CAD is free and open-source software. Most components are licensed under the **BSD** or **LGPL** licenses. See the `COPYING` file for more details.
