BRL-CAD on Windows README
=========================

The usual way to build BRL-CAD for Windows is to use the CMake build
system generator and the Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC) compiler.
Recent versions of both (as of this writing, MSVC 2013 and CMake
2.8.12+) are recommended.  If generating an installer, the Nullsoft
Scriptable Install System (NSIS) tool is also required.

In principle, BRL-CAD can be built using CMake and environments like
Cygwin and/or Mingw/Msys, but the is largely untested and infrequently
supported.  Enhancements or bug reports are welcome.

Visual Studio
-------------

To build with CMake and Visual Studio, the first step is to obtain the
BRL-CAD sources and create a build directory.  In principle, it is not
*required* to have a separate build directory, but with Windows and
Visual Studio this is the only tested configuration.  Once those the
sources are obtained and the build directory is created, run the CMake
application and specify the source and build directories.

Once CMake has the correct directory settings, select Configure.  If
this is the first time running Configure with this build directory,
CMake will prompt you to select a generator.  Look for your version of
Visual Studio and select it.  Configuration should now proceed.

It is normal for configuration to be a long process on Windows.  Once
it is complete, you should see a list of red highlighted entries
appear in the CMake interface.  Change any settings that appear to
need changing and press Configure again.  The second pass should be
shorter.  If no new red lines appear, the configuration is complete.

The final CMake step, after completing Configuration, is to select
Generate to create Visual Studio project files in the build directory.
Once this is done, you may quit CMake.

Navigate to your build directory.  You should see a BRLCAD solution
file for Visual Studio.  Double-click that file, and Visual Studio
should launch.  It will load the targets (a default configuration of
BRL-CAD on Windows will generate over 800 of them) and a large list of
targets will appear.  To build everything look for a target named
ALL_BUILD.  Start compiling that target.

Once compilation is successfully complete, you can find the compiled
executables in a 'bin' directory in your build directory.  For
example, mged.exe would be in brlcad-svn-trunk\.build\Debug\bin if
brlcad-svn-trunk\.build is the build directory specified to CMake and
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE was set to Debug.

You may want to produce an NSIS installer.  If so, locate a target 
named PACKAGE and run it.  The end result should be an .exe file 
capable of installing BRL-CAD.

MINGW (WORK IN PROGRESS - THIS DOES NOT YET WORK!!!)
-----

After installing the MINGW system, set up as follows:

set path=%path%;"C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake\bin"
set path=%path%;C:\MinGW\bin

now make a build directory, and run CMake:

cmake ..\brlcad -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DBRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS=BUNDLED

mingw32-make

Note that you don't want to do this from an msys prompt that has
sh in the path.  (ConEmu can make using the standard Windows command
prompt a bit more tolerable:  http://conemu.github.io)
