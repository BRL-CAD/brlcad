# This file defines Continuous Integration (CI) tests for BRL-CAD using the
# Github Actions framework.  Currently it defines configurations for Windows,
# Linux and OSX.
#
# Initially we used examples to try and define one common configuration for all
# platforms, but that turned out to be more complex than it was worth.  The
# different platforms manifest different issues, and it is easier to keep the
# individual steps simple and address what needs addressing per-platform.
#
# For more information about available platforms for testing, see:
#
# https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/specifications-for-github-hosted-runners
#
# The general rule when building in CI is to go more verbose in output settings
# rather than less, since iterative debugging isn't practical.  We also want to
# avoid parallel building - while that will sometimes catch dependency issues,
# it also makes the outputs far harder to interpret when there is a problem.
# Better to do parallel build debugging in an environment were more interactive
# and iterative debugging is available while preserving the readability of the
# CI outputs for other issues.
#
# Note that there is another reason not to do parallel runs; we have had some
# trouble with issues that appear to be related to files not being fully
# written out to disk. To try and help mitigate this, we don't want to stress
# the I/O subsystem any more than necessary:
