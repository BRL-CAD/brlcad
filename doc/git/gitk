# By default, gitk will not do line wrapping on Git commit messages.
#
# This does not work well for BRL-CAD commit messages, which generally are
# not line wrapped in their original form.
#
# It is recommended that users set the following setting in their gitk
# config file:

set wrapcomment word

# Generally, this file will be located at one of the following locations:
# ~/.config/git/gitk
# ~/.gitk
# %USERPROFILE%/.gitk  (Windows)
#
# (See https://stackoverflow.com/a/37648244)



# A note about how gitk displays diffs (per https://stackoverflow.com/a/3194397):
#
# "By default gitk does the same thing as the --cc option to git diff and
# compresses the merge to only show diff chunks that don't come directly from
# one or other parent."
#
# "The easiest way to view the full diff between a parent of a merge and the
# merge commit is to select the parent (normal click) and from the context menu
# on the merge commit (right/alternate click menu) select "Diff selected ->
# this"."
#
# This can be a little startling coming from an SVN background, since by
# default it looks like SVN merge commits are either no-ops or a tiny subset of
# the full diff applied.
