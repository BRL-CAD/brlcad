BRL-CAD Deprecation Log
=======================

Included below is a deprecation log and notes for BRL-CAD API changes
that potentially impact developers.  The general practice is that
public API changes may go from deprecated to obsolete during one of
the following events:

a) during a major release
    (e.g. going from 7.*.* to 8.*.*)
b) during a minor release provided that
    1) change was publicly announced as deprecated beforehand
    2) sufficient deprecation warning was been given
	i) at least three minor releases have passed since deprecation
	ii) at least three months have passed since deprecation
c) during a minor release provided that
    1) the API was never publicly announced or otherwise documented
    2) the interface was declared in a public header
    3) there exists a an equivalent alternative interface
    (e.g. changing the name of a function)

Otherwise, changes to interfaces that are never publicly announced,
are not part of publicly available documentation, and are not in
public headers are fair game to implement as needed at any time.

If a change will intentionally replace or remove routines, then those
routines should be then marked as deprecated first.  If the change is
"minimally impacting", i.e. a change to a non-critical routine that
has a suitable and completely equivalent alternative, can generally be
changed during minor releases.  An example of minimally impacting
changes include modifications like adding a new parameter to a
function or renaming a non-critical function.  Critical functions are
those related directly to geometry creation, loading, processing, and
ray-tracing; as well as the common library facilities in bu and bn.

Marking routines as deprecated can be done during compile-time with
#warning pre-processor declarations or during run-time with print
statements.

The items listed below are items that are deprecated or obsolete,
categorized by the release in which the change was made.  If the
change involved a rename/removal of a routine, both the original and
new names should be listed for reference.
