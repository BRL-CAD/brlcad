BRL-CAD Deprecation Log
=======================

Included below is a deprecation log and notes for BRL-CAD public
interface changes that potentially impact external developers and
users.  Public interfaces include developer application programming
interface (API) calls as well as user application command-line
interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI) behaviors.

The general practice is that public interface changes may go from
deprecated to obsolete, whereby previous published behavior is removed
or changed, during one of the following events:

a) during a major release (e.g. going from 7.*.* to 8.*.*)

b) during a minor release provided the change was publicly announced
   as deprecated beforehand AND sufficient deprecation warning was
   given via either i) three minor releases included the deprecation
   notice, or ii) three months passed since deprecation

c) during a minor release provided there still exists an equivalent
   alternative interface that will not impose an undue burden on users
   or developers (see "Minimally Impacting")

d) during a patch release provided you can correctly prove P = NP

If a change will intentionally replace or remove functionality, then
they should be then marked as deprecated first.  Otherwise, changes to
interfaces that are never publicly announced, not installed, or are
not part of publicly available documentation are fair game to change
as needed.

Minimally Impacting: If a change to an interface has a suitable and
completely equivalent alternative, the change is deemed to be
"minimally impacting" and can be made during any minor release.
Examples of such changes include renaming an interface, reordering
parameters, adding new parameters to an interface for previously
implicit or restricted behavior, and removing unused parameters.
Basically, the impact can usually be considered minor if a simple
regular expression search-and-replace is all that is needed.

Where feasible, interfaces should be visibly marked as deprecated
either during compile-time with #warning pre-processor declarations or
during run-time with print statements.

The items listed below are interfaces that are deprecated or obsolete,
categorized by the release in which the change was made.  If the
change involved a rename/removal of a routine, both the original and
new names should be listed for reference.
