A comprehensive solid modeling system, based on the Combinatorial Solid
Geometry (CSG) technique. Primarily used for design and analysis of
vehicles, mechanical parts, and architecture. Also used in radiation
dose planning and education, because of open software architecture.
Full source code is provided.

The distribution includes an interactive 3-D geometry editor,
ray-tracing library, sophisticated ray-tracing based lighting models,
a network-distributed ray-tracer, animation capabilities, a
network-distributed image-processing capability, image-handling, and
data-compression utilities. New in Release 4.0 is an implementation of
Weiler's n-Manifold Geometry (NMG) data structures for surface-based
solid models.

Available free of charge by signing a limited distribution agreement.
