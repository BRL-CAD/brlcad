Ideas for new BRL-CAD contributors
==================================

If you're interested in contributing to BRL-CAD, here is a general
suggested progression of tasks that are intended to help you become
familiar with the project.

* Compile, install, and run BRL-CAD

* Run the BRL-CAD Benchmark

* Go through the modeling tutorials (available on the brlcad.org website)

* Model something real in detail

* Render some pictures using rt and rtedge

* Perform basic geometric analysis using rtarea, rtweight, and g_qa

* Write a procedural geometry tool (see examples in src/proc-db)

* Write a tutorial or other documentation on some aspect of BRL-CAD

* Fix one of the bugs listed in the BUGS file

* Fix one of the bugs listed on the bug tracker

* Implement one of the items listed in the TODO file

* Implement one of the items listed on the request for enhancements tracker
