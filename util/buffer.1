.TH BUFFER 1 BRL-CAD
.SH NAME
buffer \- buffer data from stdin until EOF, then write to stdout
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B buffer
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Buffer\^
is intended to be use as part of a complex pipeline.
It serves somewhat the same purpose as the Prolog "cut" operator.
Data from stdin is read and buffered until EOF is detected, and then
all the buffered data is written to stdout.  An arbitrary amount of
data may need to be buffered, so a combination of a 1 Mbyte memory buffer
and a temporary file is used.
This can be useful when context switching may need to be reduced,
because of too many processes competing at the same time.
This can also be useful when processing data from and to the
same framebuffer with a pipeline, without interfering.
