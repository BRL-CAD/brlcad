.TH PIXSTAT 1 BRL-CAD
.SH NAME
pixstat \- list statistics related to a color pix image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pixstat
.RB [ \-v ]
[file.pix]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pixstat
will take the given
.IR pix (5)
format file,
or read from standard in.  A collection of statistics
related to the pixel intensities is produced for each color
plane (red, green, and blue).
.br
These include:
.br
The number of pixels (and the square root of this which is the
file dimensions if square).
.br
The max and min values.
.br
The mean.
.br
The median (dividing line where half the pixels are above this
value, half below).
.br
The mode (most frequently occuring value) and
the number of pixels at this value.
.br
The variance, standard deviation, and skew.
.PP
The
.B \-v
flag will also dump a histogram of the pixel values.
.SH METHOD
Since the pixel values are quantized (each color having discrete values
from 0 to 255), the statistics can be computed from "lump sums" after
building a histogram of the input.  This results in a fantastic
savings in computation while also making a single pass over the input
file sufficient.
