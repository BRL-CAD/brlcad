.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pixfade
darkens a color pix file by fading the entire image a fractional amount
or by using a pixel value as a maximum level.
.PP
The
.B \-f
option specifies a nonnegative fractional multiplier which is used
to scale the red, green, and blue values of each pixel.  In a similar
way, the
.B \-p
option is used to specify the multiplier as a nonnegative percentage.
.PP
An alternative way to darken the image is to specify a ceiling pixel
level (0 - 255) with the
.B \-m
option.  The pixel plotted is the minimum of the ceiling value and the
red, green, and blue levels of the pixel.
