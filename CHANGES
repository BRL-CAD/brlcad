BRL-CAD Interface Change Policy
===============================

This policy describes formal rules for changing an interface that
potentially impacts developers or users.  The scope is limited to
public interfaces including developer application programming
interfaces (APIs), user application command-line interfaces (CLIs),
and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  The policy aims to balance
developer agility with interface stability.  Note that renaming an
application is NOT considered minimally impacting, since that name
is the primary means by which users locate the application.

All changes to BRL-CAD are expected to conform to this change policy.
Changes MUST either be:

    A) MINIMALLY IMPACTING, or
    B) FORMALLY DEPRECATED.


MINIMALLY IMPACTING
-------------------

Changes deemed "minimally impacting" can be made at any time.  For a
change to be considered as such, its effect must be strictly limited.
Most are itemized under MINIMALLY IMPACTING CHANGES.  They MUST be:

    A.1) a relatively new interface

        Interfaces introduced recently are often subject to rapid
        development change.  New interfaces are not subject to formal
        deprecation rules until they have been included in at least
        TWO releases without change.

    A.2) an appreciably broken interface

        Interfaces that have been unusable for at least TWO releases
        may be fixed, changed, or removed without notice.  A broken
        interface is one that does not perform its intended function
        and does not have secondary utility.

    A.3) an elementary change

        Simple changes that are trivially accommodated without
        conditional logic or manual inspection can be made at will.
        It includes mechanical changes that can be automatically
        updated by a single static regular expression substitution.

        Examples include renaming, reordering parameters, adding
        optional parameters, eliminating a duplicate equivalent
        interface, adding parameters for implicit behavior, and
        removing unused parameters.


FORMALLY DEPRECATED
-------------------

Changes not minimally impacting must follow formal deprecation
process.  This defers significant changes to major release points or
requires public notification in advance.  Changes are documented in
this file first as DEPRECATED CHANGES then later as OBSOLETED CHANGES.
An interface may be changed:

    B.1) during a major release (e.g. from 7.*.* to 8.*.*)

        Any change may be made without notice.  Major version number
        releases imply intrinsic incompatibility or interface change.

    B.2) during a minor release (e.g., from 7.26.* to 7.28.*)

        The interface must be publicly deprecated beforehand with
        advance notice given in at least TWO minor releases and after
        at least 90 days elapsed since initial release announcement.

Public interfaces scheduled for change should be noted in this file
and visibly marked in the source code.  This marking may be the
DEPRECATED keyword on function declarations, #warning "DEPRECATED ..."
pre-processor statements, @DEPRECATED source code comments, and
combinations thereof.

Where usage is not adversely affected, a run-time statement may be
displayed (typically "DEPRECATION WARNING: ...").  All call references
and documentation should be updated prior to obsoleting.


EXAMPLES
--------

Example #1: rt_shootray() removal

It's decided during 7.50.3 development to remove the rt_shootray()
function. That does NOT qualify as "minimally impacting" because
there's no equivalent replacement and rt_shootray() has been published
and documented in more than two releases.  The function gets listed as
DEPRECATED in the CHANGES file, marked as DEPRECATED in the API
header, and is published via the 7.50.4 release.

The soonest that function could be removed / obsoleted would be in
7.54.0 during 7.53.* development provided more than 90 days had passed
since the initial announcement.  It could NOT be removed in 7.54.2 as
that's a patch version, prior to 7.54, nor during 7.54.0 if less than
90 days had passed since 7.50.6 was posted.

Example #2: bu_log() mod

It's decided during 7.48.1 development to modify bu_log() by adding an
additional optional enum parameter denoting a message type, e.g.,
bu_log(INFO, ...).  This change is considered "minimally impacting"
because it can be characterized by a simple regular expression (e.g.,
"s/bu_log\(/bu_log(INFO, /g)" and calling codes are trivially
accommodated.  All calls to bu_log() should be updated to the new form
prior to change announcement.

The function could be changed at any time so long as it's documented
under MINIMALLY IMPACTING CHANGES.

                    (reverse chronological order)

The interfaces announced below are scheduled to significantly change
or be removed.  They are categorized by the release in which
deprecation was first announced.  If the interface change involved a
removal or transition, both the original and new interface names are
generally listed for reference.

Items marked with a "'" (single quote) are undocumented and may be
removed at any time.

**********************************************************************
***                  MINIMALLY IMPACTING CHANGES                   ***
**********************************************************************
                    (forward chronological order)

All minimally impacting changes are listed by release as regular
expressions.  Unless noted otherwise, expressions are shown using Perl
syntax (i.e., the '(', ')', and '|' characters pertain to
subexpression captures, escaping with '\' matches literally.
Expressions should apply via:

perl -0777 -pi -e 'EXPRESSION' FILE

To apply an expression to an entire source tree, the following pattern
may work:

find . -type f -not -path "*.git/*" -regex '.*\(c\|cpp\|cxx\|h\|hpp\)$' -exec perl -0777 -pi -e 'EXPRESSION' {} \;

find src \( -name '*.c' -or -name '*.cxx' -or -name '*.cpp' -or -name '*.h' -or -name '*.hxx' -or -name '*.hpp' -or -name '*.java' -or -name '*.f' -or -name '*.sh' -or -name '*.tcl' -or -name '*.tk' -or -name '*.itcl' -or -name '*.itk' -or -name '*.pl' -or -name '*.php' -or -name '*.inc' -or -name '*.mged' -or -name '*.y' -or -name '*.l' -or -name '*.yy' \) -not \( -name other -or -regex '.*/other/.*' -or -name tools -or -regex '.*/misc/tools/.*' -or -regex '.*/\.[^\.].*' -or -regex '.*~' -or -regex '.*/#.*' \)

Expressions are minimally tested, use with caution.  Make a backup.
