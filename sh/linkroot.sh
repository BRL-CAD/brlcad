#
# Script used to create or recreate symbolink links in an installation
# root directory where there are multiple versions installed in the
# format:
#          /usr/brlcad/rel-7.6.2
#          /usr/brlcad/rel-7.8.0
#          /usr/brlcad/rel-7.10.0
#
# In the base root directory (e.g. /usr/brlcad), there are symbolic
# links that point to the "stable" version.  This script creates those
# links including updating the stable link itself, which points to a
# given version.
#
# With the links in place, users only need to ensure that the base
# root directories are in their path. (e.g. /usr/brlcad/bin)
#
# Usage:
#          ./linkroot.sh base_root stable_release
#
# Example:
#          ./linkroot.sh /usr/brlcad /usr/brlcad/rel-7.10.0
