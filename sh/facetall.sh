# This script iterates over all regions in a geometry file and
# attempts to facetize them all.  The following scripts can then
#
# Replaces facetall.sh conversions assuming file didn't already
# contain bot objects:
#
# file=file.g ; for i in `mged -c $file search . -type bot 2>&1` ; do base=`echo $i|sed 's/.bot//g'` ; mged -c $file killtree $base \; mv $i $base ; done
#
# Great for calculating number of polygons in file:
#
# file=file.g ; total=0 ; for i in `mged -c $file search . -type bot 2>&1` ; do cnt=`mged -c $file l $i 2>&1 | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d :` ; total="`expr $cnt + $total`" ; echo "$total (+ $cnt)" ; done
#
# This script could use some TLC.
