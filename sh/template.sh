#
# Generates an empty template file with a standard header and footer
# already applied.  Basically, this is a wrapper on a couple other
# steps and scripts that are frequently used to stub out new files
# being added.
#
# Examples:
#
#   # create a new template C file with an LGPL header
#   sh/template.sh lgpl somefile.c
#
#   # create a new shell script file under the BSD license
#   sh/template.sh bsd newscript.sh
