#
# The purpose of this script is to update source files in a project so
# that they have more consistent whitespace (aka "ws") formatting.
#
# The list of things the script can perform are as follows:
#
#   a) removes whitespace on lines that only have whitespace.
#
#   b) removes whitespace at the end of any line.
#
#   c) removes successive blanks lines so there are no more than two
#      in a row anywhere in a given file.  WS_SUCCESSIVE=2
#
#   d) removes all blank lines at the end of a file.
#
#   e) ensures that there is a newline at the end of file.
#
#   f) expand embedded tabs to spaces. (DISABLED BY DEFAULT)
#
#   g) unexpands leading whitespace and tabs, inserting tabs at the
#      default system tabstops.	 WS_TABSTOPS=8
#
#   *) show progress.  WS_PROGRESS=yes
#
#   *) keep backups if a change is made.  WS_BACKUPS=yes
#
# By default, the script will perform all of the above actions.	 You
# can customize the set of changes the script performs by setting the
# WS environment variable to the letter(s) of the task to run.	There
# are also several other WS_* variables that can be set to modify
# default behavior settings.
#
# Examples:
#   # only remove blank lines and whitespace at end of lines
#   WS=abd ./ws.sh some_file
#
#   # reduce collections of blank lines to no more than 4 in a row
#   WS_SUCCESSIVE=2 WS=ac ./ws.sh some_file
#
#   # run all tasks on all files in current directory without backups
#   WS_BACKUPS=no find . -type f -exec ./ws.sh {} \;
#
