branch/attr-extension-mods
==========================

To turn on the use of binary attributes define:

  USE_BINARY_ATTRIBUTES

Files affected:

  ./include/bu/parse.h
  ./include/bu/avs.h
  ./src/librt/db5_io.c
  ./src/librt/attributes.c

A db admin tool (to be renamed to sonething like: db-admin-tool):

  ./src/util/admin-db.cpp

Test plan:

1. Select a complex TGM in the db directory as a test subject.
2. Create a script to:

   + copy the TGM to a new file (TGM2)
   + add multiple binary attributes to TGM2
   + use the admin-db tool to check TGM2
   + delete the added binary attributes from TGM2
   + run cmp on TGM and TGM2 to see they are the same
