.I basename
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wasatchrle
converts image files generated by the Wasatch Systems Paint program
to RLE format.  It expects to find two files, 
"\fIbasename\fR.lut" (the color look-up table) and "\fIbasename\fR.rlc" 
(the run-length encoded data).

.I Wasatchrle
generates as output a single channel RLE image with a full
color map.  Since the Wasatch Paint program's origin is the top left
of the image, the results should be passed through
.I rleflip \-v
to correctly orient the image.  If the image is to be used with other
toolkit operations (e.g., compositing), it should first be run through
.IR applymap (1)
to convert the image to a full color (three channel) RLE
file.
