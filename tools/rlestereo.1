.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR Rlestereo
reads the two named RLE files and produces a single image suitable for
viewing
with red-blue or red-green glasses.

The 'left' image is converted to
greyscale and written on the red channel.  The 'right' image is converted
to greyscale and written on the blue or green channel.  The intensity of the
two channels may be scaled in order to compensate for the relative
intensities of the two base colors as viewed through the glasses.
