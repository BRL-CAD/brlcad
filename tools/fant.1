.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR Fant
rotates or scales an image by an arbitrary amount.  It does this by
using pixel integration (if the image size is reduced) or pixel interpolation
if the image size is increased.  Because it works with subpixel precision,
aliasing artifacts are not introduced (hah! see BUGS).  
.I Fant
uses a two-pass 
sampling technique to perform the transformation.  If
.I infile
is "\-" or absent, input is read from the standard input.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-a " angle"
Amount to rotate image by, a real number from 0 to 45 degrees (positive
numbers rotate clockwise).  Use rleflip(1) first to rotate an image by larger
amounts.
.TP
.B "\-b"
Blur the resulting image. 
Always interpolate between pixels of the input image.  This results in
fewer artifacts but a slightly blurry resulting image.  Recommended for
pathological cases such as single pixel wide lines in the input image.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
Specifies where to place the resulting image.  The default is to write
to stdout.  If
.I outfile
is "\-", the output will be written to the standard output stream.
.TP
.BI \-p " xoff yoff"
Specifies where the origin of the image is \- the image is rotated or scaled
about this point.  If no origin is specified, the center of the image is used.
.TP
.BI \-s " xscale yscale"
The amount (in real numbers) to scale an image by.  This is often
useful for correcting the aspect of an image for display on a frame
buffer with non square pixels.  For this use, the origin should be
specified as 0, 0 (see \fB\-p\fP above).  If an image is only scaled
in Y and no rotation is performed,
.IR fant 
only uses one sampling pass over the image, cutting the computation time
in half.
.TP
.B "\-v"
Verbose output.  Primarily for debugging.

.SH BUGS
.IR Fant
uses a rather poor anti-aliasing filter (a box filter).  This is usually
good enough but will exhibit noticeable aliasing artifacts on nasty
input images.
