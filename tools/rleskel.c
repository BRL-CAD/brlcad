 * TAG( main )
 * 
 * A skeleton RLE tool.  Demonstrates argument parsing, opening,
 * reading, and writing RLE files.  Includes support for files
 * consisting of concatenated images.
 * Usage:
 * 	rleskel [-o outfile] [infile]
 * Inputs:
 * 	infile:		The input RLE file.  Default stdin.
 * 			"-" means stdin.
 * Outputs:
 * 	-o outfile:	The output RLE file.  Default stdout.
 * 			"-" means stdout.
 * Assumptions:
 *	[None]
 * Algorithm:
 * 	Repeatedly read from the input until the file EOF or an
 * 	error is encountered.
