			    BRL-CAD
			 Release 7.32.4
		       http://brlcad.org/

BRL-CAD is a powerful cross-platform open source combinatorial
solid modeling system that includes an interactive 3D solid geometry
editor, a network-distributed symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)
high-performance ray-tracer with support for rendering and geometric
analysis, image and signal-processing tools, a system performance
analysis benchmark suite, a flexible geometry scripting interface, 
and a high-performance geometric representation and analysis library.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

This README file exists only to provide you a brief roadmap to the
contents of the BRL-CAD distribution.

Some platforms have additional platform-specific documentation that
should be consulted after reading this file:

  doc/README.AIX        -- IBM's Advanced Interactive eXecutive OS
  doc/README.BSD        -- FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, etc.
  doc/README.IRIX       -- SGI IRIX and IRIX64
  doc/README.Linux      -- Various Linux distributions
  doc/README.MacOSX     -- Apple Mac OS X
  doc/README.Solaris    -- Oracle Solaris, OpenIndiana (Illumos), etc.
  doc/README.Windows    -- Microsoft Windows

The information on how to install and operate the software, to become
involved with the development of the package, or to run the benchmark
performance test suite have each become sufficiently large that their
details are covered in more detail in standalone documents.  For more
details on what BRL-CAD provides, see the documentation provided on
the website at http://brlcad.org/.

Information relevant to those interested in the source code is
contained in the HACKING and COPYING files.  See doc/benchmark.tr file
for benchmark suite information.  There is a variety of other
documentation and information also available in the doc/ directory.

Please note that this distribution package does not include the
various military-specific model analysis tools such as MUVES, GIFT,
SAR, SLAVE, VAST, etc., nor does it include any military geometry
databases.  If you desire to have access to this material, please
contact one of the BRL-CAD developers.


COMPILE AND INSTALL
-------------------

In order to compile and install BRL-CAD from a source distribution,
the CMake ( http://www.cmake.org ) configuration tool is requird.

The following steps should result in a successful install:

  tar -xvzf brlcad-VERSION.tar.gz
  mkdir brlcad-VERSION/build
  cd brlcad-VERSION/build
  cmake .. -DBRLCAD_ENABLE_STRICT=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  make -j4
  make install

See the INSTALL file for explanation of the various configuration
options available when building BRL-CAD.

Once the build completes and assuming you have proper filesystem
permissions, you should be able to begin the installation by running
the "make install" .  By default, the package is configured to install
entirely into /usr/brlcad/.

You will need to add /usr/brlcad/bin to your path (or whatever path the
variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX was set to during configure) in order for
the BRL-CAD binaries to be in your path.


BENCHMARK
---------

After the build successfully completes, you will be able to verify
basic functionality by running the BRL-CAD Benchmark.  Running the
benchmark suite is integrated into the build system such that any time
after running CMake (in the cmake gui, configure and generate must both
be performed) you may run:

  make benchmark

If the build is successful, you will see "CORRECT" numbers and a
performance summary at the end.  The "vgr" line effectively shows you
approximately how much faster your machine is to a VAX 11/780.  After
installing BRL-CAD, you may run the 'benchmark' tool as well to run
the BRL-CAD Benchmark.

See the paper in doc/benchmark.tr for information on analyzing and
comparing the results of the benchmark tests in more detail.


COMMUNICATION
-------------

There are various BRL-CAD mailing lists available including three
developer-oriented lists, a user list, and a read-only news
announcement list:

For interactive discussion, there is Zulip chat and IRC available:

DISTRIBUTION DETAILS
--------------------

BRL-CAD is available via Git or Subversion checkout from:

https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad

There is also a paid-for full-service support distribution available
for those interested through SURVICE Engineering, Inc., and the
Survivability/Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC).

SURVICE provides their own BRL-CAD distribution that comes with
commercial support, documentation, and installation media.  Full
technical assistance is provided to their commercial distributions by
phone, FAX, postal mail, or e-mail.  Agencies of the Federal
Government may acquire the full service distribution with a MIPR or
OGA funds transfer.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
----------------------

BRL-CAD is the primary tri-service solid modeling CAD system used by
the U.S. military to model weapons systems for vulnerability and
lethality analyses.  The solid modeling system is frequently used in a
wide range of military and industrial application including in the
design and analysis of vehicles, mechanical parts, and architecture.
The package has also been used in radiation dose planning, medical
visualization, computer graphics education, CSG concepts and modeling
education, and system performance benchmark testing among other
purposes.

Actively developed since 1979, BRL-CAD is a collection of more than
400 tools, utilities, and applications comprising more than a million
lines of source code.  BRL-CAD supports a great variety of geometric
representations including an extensive set of traditional CSG
primitive implicit solids such as boxes, ellipsoids, cones, and tori,
as well as explicit solids made from closed collections of Uniform
B-Spline Surfaces, Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces,
n-Manifold Geometry (NMG), and purely faceted mesh geometry.  All
geometric objects may be combined using boolean set-theoretic CSG
operations including union, intersection, and difference.

BRL-CAD has been under active development for more than 20 years with
a portability heritage that includes systems such as a DEC VAX-11/780
running 4.3 BSD; DECStations running ULTRIX; Silicon Graphics 3030, 4D
"IRIS", O2, Onyx, and Origin systems running various versions of IRIX;
Sun Microsystems Sun-3 and Sun-4 Sparcs running SunOS; the Cray 1,
Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, and Cray 2 running UNICOS; DEC Alpha AXP running
OSF/1; Apple Macintosh II running A/UX; iPSC/860 Hypercube running
NX/2; the Alliant FX/8, FX/80, and FX/2800; Gould/Encore SEL PowerNode
6000/9000 and NP1; NeXT workstations; IBM RS/6000; HPPA 9000/700
running HPUX; Ardent/Stardent; Encore Multi-Max; and much much more.
BRL-CAD's extensive portability of course also includes a plethora of
common desktop and server versions of BSD, IRIX, Solaris, Mac OS X,
Linux, and Windows.

The BRL-CAD package is intentionally designed to be extensively
cross-platform and is actively developed on and maintained for many
common operating system environments including for BSD, IRIX, Linux,
Solaris, Mac OS X, and Windows among others.  The entire package is
distributed in binary and source code form as free open source
software (FOSS), provided under Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved
license terms.  BRL-CAD was released as open source in December 2004.
See the COPYING file for more details.
