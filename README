                             BRL-CAD
                         Release 7.0.0
                       http://brlcad.org/

BRL-CAD is a comprehensive solid modeling system based on the
Combinatorial/Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) technique.  The
package is Primarily used for design and analysis of vehicles,
mechanical parts, and architecture. Also used in radiation dose
planning and education.

The distribution includes an interactive 3-D geometry editor,
ray-tracing library, sophisticated ray-tracing based lighting models,
a network-distributed ray-tracer, animation capabilities, a
network-distributed image-processing capability, image-handling, and
data-compression utilities.  Also included is an implementation of
Weiler's n-Manifold Geometry (NMG) data structures for surface-based
solid models and photon mapping.

CONTENTS

This README file exists only to provide you a brief roadmap to the
contents of the BRL-CAD distribution.  

The information on how to install and operate the software, to become
involved with the development of the package, or to run the benchmark
performance test suite have each become sufficiently large that their
details are covered in more detail in standalone documents.  For more
details on what BRL-CAD provides, see the documentation provided on
the website.  Information relevant to those interested in the source
code is contained in the HACKING and COPYING files.  See
doc/benchmark.tr file for benchmark suite information.  There is a
variety of other information also available in the doc/ directory.

Please note that this distribution package does not include the
various military-specific model analysis tools such as MUVES, GIFT,
SAR, SLAVE, VAST, etc., nor does it include any military geometry
databases.  If you desire to have access to this material, please
contact one of the BRL-CAD developers.

INSTALLATION

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

BENCHMARK

See the paper in doc/benchmark.doc for information on analyzing the
results of the benchmark tests.  Comparisons between various different
computers are listed.

BACKGROUND MATERIAL

For overview information on the whole package, consult the overview
paper in the filepapers/overview, and the brlcad(1) manual page in the
file util/brlcad.1.  For a discussion of the significance of this
software, read the paper "Understanding the Preparation and Analysis
of Solid Models".

DISTRIBUTION DETAILS

Full service distribution: The Survivability/Vulnerability Information
Analysis Center (SURVIAC) administers the supported BRL-CAD
distributions and information exchange programs for ARL.  Full service
distributions a copy of the full distribution materials on your choice
of magnetic tape media, or you may elect to obtain your copy via FTP.
One printed set of BRL-CAD documentation will be mailed to you.
Software upgrades will be provided at no additional charge, and you
will have access to full technical assistance by phone, FAX, letter,
or E-mail.  Agencies of the Federal Government may acquire the full
service distribution with a simple MIPR or OGA funds transfer.

COMMUNICATION

You are invited to participate in the InterNet (aka "ARPANET")
electronic mailing list on the BRL-CAD software, which is called
<brlcad-users@lists.sourceforge.net>.  If you are a developer, there
is also a separate list called <brlcad-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>.
Bug reports and discussions of new features are the main topics; the
volume of messages fluctuates over time.

A variety of information on BRL-CAD is available via the
World-Wide-Web.  Papers, documentation, and the software repository
may be found at:

FUTURE EVENTS

It is expected that new releases of this software will be issued
between once and twice a year.  Information about new releases will be
routinely provided by electronic mail to recipients of this software.

Best Wishes,
The BRL-CAD Development Team
