CONTENTS

This README file exists only to provide you a brief roadmap to the
contents of the BRL-CAD distribution.  The information on how to
install and operate the software, and perform the benchmark tests have
become sufficiently large that they are now each a standalone
document.  

Please note that this distribution package does not include the
various military-specific model analysis tools such as MUVES, GIFT,
SAR, SLAVE, VAST, etc., nor does it include any military geometry
databases.  If you desire to have access to this material, please
contact one of the BRL-CAD developers.

INSTALLATION

To install BRL-CAD, see the instructions in doc/install.doc. This file
includes directions on the best way to get started with the
distribution, as well as details on how to configure and install the
software.  This file also includes directions on how to compile and
run the benchmark tests.

BENCHMARK

See the paper in doc/benchmark.doc for information on analyzing the
results of the benchmark tests.  Comparisons between various different
computers are listed.

BACKGROUND MATERIAL

paper in the filepapers/overview, and the brlcad(1) manual page in the
