DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE
Release 1.24
(24-June-87)
.fi
.sp
.sp "VERSION"
.sp
This document is printed from the README file in the CAD distribution.
The printed copies are usually somewhat older
than the version on the actual distribution tape.  When attempting to
install the software, please refer to the version from the distribution
tape.
.sp
.IP "DISTRIBUTION DETAILS"
.sp
To obtain a copy of the distribution, you should send the authors:
.sp
1)  Enough magnetic tape for 20 Mbytes of data.  For 9-track 1/2 inch magtape,
specify density (800, 1600, or 6250).  Silicon Graphics and SUN tape
cartridges can also be accommodated.  Specify TAR or CPIO, and blocksize
of 5k (CPIO default), 10k (TAR default), 200k (SGI default), or other.
.sp
2)  A letter indicating:
.sp
.nf
	-- Who you are
	-- What the BRL CAD package is to be used for
	-- Equipment and operating system(s) you plan on using
	-- That you agree to the conditions listed below.
.fi
.sp
The software is distributed free of charge with the following conditions:
.sp
1.  The BRL CAD package source files won't be passed on to third parties.  If
someone wants them, have them contact BRL.  We need to know who has
what, and what it is being used for.
.sp
2.  BRL will be credited should the software be used in a product or written
about in any publication.  BRL will be referenced as the original
source in any advertisements.
.sp
3.  BRL assumes no legal responsibility for source code and its subsequent
use.  No warranty is expressed or implied.
.sp
4.  If any bugs or problems are found they will be reported back to BRL.
.fi
.sp
You will own full rights to any databases or images you create with this
package.
.sp
To obtain authorization for use at additional sites, or for permission
to use this work as part of a commercial package, please contact the
authors at the address below.
.sp
For non-US sites, an extra step is required.  You must send your letter
and tape to your Ambassador to the United States in Washington DC, and
have them forwarded to BRL through official channels.  Our current
understanding is that any requests from Foreign governments should be
sent on a Government to Government basis. The non-US Embassy should
forward requests to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence,
Department of the Army.  They handle all requests from foreign
governments, and they decide where it goes from there.  The address
to use is claimed to be:

.sp
This distribution does NOT include the various BRL-specific model
analysis tools such as GIFT, SAR, SLAVE, VAST, etc.
.sp
For overview information on the whole package, consult the brlcad(1)
manual page, in the util/ directory. For a discussion of the
significance of this software, read the paper "Understanding the
Preparation and Analysis of Solid Models", included in the paper/
directory.
.sp
The first sections of this file discuss how to configure and compile
just enough software to run the benchmark.  After the benchmark results
are presented, information about configuring and installing the full
software package is presented.  If you encounter difficulty with
running the benchmark, you might wish to build the full package, to
take advantage of the image tools in tracking down your trouble.
.sp
.IP "BENCHMARK BACKGROUND"
.sp
This file describes how to set up enough of the CAD package to
run a benchmark test of the RT ray-tracing program on the sample
databases provided.  Each run will produce a 512x512x24 bit color
shaded image in a "bench/xxx.pix" file, and a run log in "bench/xxx.log".
Reference copies of the images are provided as "pix/xxx.pix" and
"pix/xxx.log".  The sample databases provided are processed in
order of increasing difficulty, and each produces a colorful image.  In
each picture there are two light sources; the primary source is located
near the center of the model (the white ball), and the secondary light
source is located at the "eye" position.
.sp
moss.g  --  This is a simple model, containing a yellow torus,
a green ellipsoid, a bluish cube, a pink truncated (distorted) cone,
all sitting on a blue plate.  Note the shadowing, and "specular splash".
.sp
world.g -- The same model as moss.g, but with various rendering
features enabled.  The model is enclosed in a hollow cloud sphere.
The plate is a mirror, the egg is crystal, the box has a debugging
texture map applied.
.sp
star.g  --  A familiar sight to Star Trek fans;  a low-detail exterior
of the ship "Enterprise".  The hull is white, with some other structures
in other colors.  The small red object in the foreground is the
shuttlecraft Galileo, to scale.
.sp
bldg391.g  --  An exploded view of a two-story imaginary computer site,
including various walls, red stairways, green disk drives, etc.
The lower floor is a mirror, the upper floor is glass.
.sp
The RT benchmark requires a binary database for input ("pix/xxx.g"), and
produces a binary image as output ("bench/xxx.pix"), along with a log
file ("bench/xxx.log").  To make this distribution machine independent,
both the databases and the reference copies of the images are provided
in an ASCII format in the "db" and "pix" directories, and
ascii-to-binary converters are provided.  If you are running this
benchmark on a non-UNIX machine that has difficulty writing binary
streams, change the "-o file.pix" flag to "-O file.a_pix" and RT
will write the ASCII form directly.  For more discussion, consult
the doc/pix.5 and conv/asc2pix.1 manual pages.
.sp
.IP "THE BENCHMARK."
.sp
These steps are involved in loading the software and running the benchmark
on a UNIX system:
.sp
.nf
1)  Load the distribution.
	mkdir cad
	cd cad
	tar x
(On System V, use ``tar xo'' instead, to forgo chown-ing away the files).
.sp
2)  Edit the various header files and Makefiles (see below for details).
	ed Makefile.defs
	ed h/machine.h                  # defaults OK for 32-bit systems
.sp
3)  Compile everything, and convert the databases and reference images.
	make benchmark
.sp
4)  Run the benchmark.  Make sure that the answers match the reference files
to within plus-or-minus one in each color (see pixdiff(1)).
	cd bench
	sh run                  # takes several VAX hours.
	cd ..
.fi
.sp
5)  Compare the execution times in the "bench/xxx.log" files with the
VAX-11/780 (with hardware FPA) times which are given in the
"pix/xxx.log" files.
.sp
.IP "BENCHMARK CONFIGURATION"
.sp
1)  The first configuration step is to edit the "Makefile.defs"
file in the top directory of the distribution.  In a future version
of the distribution, the main alternatives for this file
will all be provided;  right now, a variety of things need to
be tailored.  Everything is clearly marked;  #SYSV# appears near
symbols that need to be changed to run on a System V UNIX.
Certain vendor-specific settings are similarly marked, eg,
#SGI#, #GOULD#, #ALLIANT#, #CRAY#, etc.  As distributed, this file
is configured for a 4.n BSD Berkeley UNIX system on a VAX.
.sp
Select the correct value for SYSTEM.
.sp
At present, SYSVERS should be defined only on Silicon Graphics (SGI)
systems.  Set SYSVERS to either SGI34 for Release 3.4 and below, or
SGI35 for Release 3.5 and above. If you do not have the TCP option on
your SGI, don't define either.
.sp
Configuration of libfb.  Full details on configuring the framebuffer
library are provided in the "Full Configuration" section, below. If you
just desire to run the benchmark but not display images, this library is
still necessary, as the debug and disk-file interfaces are always
provided.  In this case, the LIBFB_CFILES, LIBFB_OBJS, and LIBFB_CONFIG
lines should be null lists, ie:
.sp
.nf
	LIBFB_CFILES	=
	LIBFB_OBJS	=
	LIBFB_CONFIG	=
.fi
.sp
In the case of extreme difficulty, a no-op stub version of libfb
is provided in rt/libfb-dummy.c.
.sp
The timer configuration LIBRT_TIMER must be specified, based on the
version of UNIX you are using. This timer module is for providing CPU
and elapsed time indications.  If your system has a vendor-specific clock
with more resolution than the normal UNIX library provides, you should
create your own system-specific timerXXX.c module. The line is
distributed as:
.sp
.nf
.ta 0.5i 2i 3i 4i 5i 6i
	LIBRT_TIMER	= timer42
.sp
For System V, select instead:
.sp
	LIBRT_TIMER	= timerunix
.sp
The full range of choices are:
.TS
center box;
l l.
timer42	4.2 BSD, 4.3 BSD (Berkeley UNIX)
timerunix	Generic UNIX, System III, V, etc.
timer52brl	For BRL's System 5-under-4.n BSD
timerhep	Denelcor HEP
timercray	Cray X-MP and Cray-2, running UNICOS (UNIX)
timercos	Cray X-MP running COS
.TE
.fi
.sp
2)  The file "h/machine.h" has a number of configuration
options, including the setting of:
.sp
.TS
center box;
l l.
fastf_t	fastest "C" floating point type (\fBfloat\fR or \fBdouble\fR)
LOCAL	\fBstatic\fR or \fBauto\fR, for fastest local data type.
FAST	LOCAL or register, for FAST fastf_t variables.
PARALLEL	Defined for parallel processors.
.TE
.sp
VAX, GOULD, Cray, Alliant and HEP examples are provided. The defaults
should be correct for reasonable 32-bit serial computers.  Note that
K&R ``C'' specifies that all floating point calculations must be done
as \fBdouble\fR, so it is usually fastest to set fastf_t to \fBdouble\fR.
Also note that when \fBfloat\fR is 32-bit IEEE or IBM style floating
point, not enough accuracy is carried to correctly process large models.
See the "Silicon Graphics Warnings" section for more information.
.sp
3)  It is important to run "make depend" in the top directory of the
distribution each time these Makefiles are changed.  For libfb, mged,
and librt, it is also necessary to run "make clean" in those directories
after making related changes to the Makefiles, because the binaries
of some modules depend on configuration options selected in the Makefiles.
.sp
.IP "BENCHMARK RESULTS"
.sp
In the tradition of Dongarra, the Rays/sec figure is considered the
"RT Figure of Merit" (RTFM).  Note that the RTFM can only be compared
between different runs on the \fIsame\fR database;  it is not meaningful
to compare RTFM numbers between different databases. The Rays/sec number
for a multi-processor machine is for "aggregate CPU cluster seconds",
rather than rays/total CPU seconds (which remains fairly constant on
good parallel machines). Worthy finalists to date are listed below.
Entries are omitted for tests in which correct results were not
obtained.

It would be greatly appreciated if you would return to BRL any
statistics that you gather, including:  which BRL CAD release
was used, the manufacturer of the machine,
hardware and software version numbers, presence or absence of floating
point hardware, and the name (preferably InterNet or UUCP) of the
specific machine used.
.sp
.IP "FURTHER OPTIMIZATIONS"
.sp
After initial testing, you may wish to go back and enable the special
assembler version of sqrt(), by uncommenting and editing the FAST_SQRT
line in "librt/Makefile.loc".  4.2BSD VAX and Gould UTX 1.2 versions
are provided.  Note that the 4.3BSD VAX library sqrt() is even faster
than this one by more than 40%.
.sp
The file "h/vmath.h" has macros for numerous common vector operations;
if your system has hardware support for vector operations, after getting
the program working you would profit greatly from changing these macros
to machine-specific code.  The most important macros are MAT4X3VEC and
MAT4X3PNT.
See also "rt/machine.c".
If you do this, please submit the "rays/sec" figures for the
original as well as the optimized runs.
.sp
BRL is currently attempting explicit vector extensions to the C language,
as well as working with compilers that detect implicit vectorization.
This work will be included in a subsequent release.
.sp
.IP "SILICON GRAPHICS WARNINGS"
.sp
If you are attempting to run the benchmark on an SGI IRIS, beware of the
\fBlong float\fR -vs- \fBdouble\fR controversy.  The SGI C compiler
converts both \fBfloat\fR and \fBdouble\fR to 32-bit single-precision
numbers. While the current release of librt is believed to generally
operate correctly in spite of this, beware of the RT program failing to
find roots, or being unable to perform a "box push". Unfortunately, the
"star.pix" RT benchmark will will fail due to lack of floating point
precision, and generate lots of diagnostics, filling your disk.
.sp
SGI software release version 3.3.1, 3.4, and 3.5 have a defective
library version of hypot();  be aware of the (slower) substitute in
"rt/machine.c".
.sp
Operations of the form "*fp += incr;" are known to compile incorrectly
on release 3.5 when "fp" is declared as "\fBregister double\fR *fp"
(or \fBregister float\fR).  The one known instance of this in
util/bwmod.c has been "fixed" with a #\fBifdef\fR sgi.
.sp
When running MGED on a 3.5 Iris with XNS networking, there is no
select() capability, so non-blocking I/O has to be used instead.
This has two undesirable side effects.  First, it puts MGED into
a hard loop polling the workstation keyboard.  Second, it seems to
have an interaction with control-S/control-Q flow control -- if you
suspend output, most of it will be discarded.  However, MGED is
still usable in this configuraition.
.sp
Currently there are no good solutions to these problems.  Voice your
opinions to the vendor.
.sp
It is very useful to add a "gclear" account to each SGI, so that after
using the screen in 24-bit mode you can regain control of the screen by
typing "gclear", whether or not you are logged in.  Add this line
to /etc/passwd:
.sp
gclear::4:5::/tmp:/usr/bin/gclear
.sp
.IP "FULL INSTALLATION"
.sp
The steps involved in installing the full BRL CAD package
on a UNIX system are these:
.sp
.nf
.ta 0.5i 2i 3i 4i 5i 6i
1)  Load the distribution.
	mkdir cad
	cd cad
	tar x
(On System V, use ``tar xo'' instead, to forgo chown-ing away the files).
.sp
2)  Edit the various header files and Makefiles (see below).
	ed Makefile.defs
	ed h/machine.h	                  # defaults OK for 32-bit systems
	ed Makefile		# to remove IF_REMOTE
	ed rfbd/Makefile.loc		# configure rfbd
	ed util/Makefile.loc		# if SYSV
.sp
3)  Compile everything.
	make all
.sp
4)  After everything compiles, install everything.
	make install
.sp
.IP "FULL CONFIGURATION"
.sp
The following assumes that you have already loaded the distribution per
step 1 of "The Benchmark" section, and performed the configuration
outlined in the "Benchmark Configuration" section, above.
.sp
Note that if you are configuring the software for more than one type of
computer, you will have to go through this configuration procedure
separately for each system.  Configuration questions apply only to
the hardware available on the particular system presently being
configured. If you have several types of machine sharing a single
filesystem using NFS, be certain to have a separate CAD tree for each
machine, to keep the binaries separate.
.sp
You may wish to install the package in directories other than where BRL
does. In general, all CAD executable programs are installed in BINDIR
(/usr/brl/bin), with libraries going in LIBDIR (/usr/brl/lib). Users are
told to find the CAD-related include files in INCLUDE_DIR
(/usr/include/brlcad). Be certain to examine these defines in
Makefile.defs. The remote-frame-buffer daemon is installed in
/usr/brl/etc, see rfbd/Makefile.loc.  If you wish to use the BRL
directories, you may need to run (as root):
.br
.nf
 	mkdir /usr/include/brlcad
 	mkdir /usr/brl 
	mkdir /usr/brl/bin
 	mkdir /usr/brl/lib
 	mkdir /usr/brl/etc
.fi
.br
and then use chown(1) and chmod(1) to suit.
.sp
The configuration for libfb must be edited to reflect the display
hardware that you have.  Even if your system has no display hardware,
this library is necessary, as the debug and disk-file interfaces are
always useful.  (Lacking any displays at all, you may be able to utilize
the bw-impress(1) program to produce pictures on an Imagen
laser-printer). In the case of no display hardware at all, the
LIBFB_CFILES, LIBFB_OBJS, and LIBFB_CONFIG lines should be null lists,
ie:
.sp
.ta 0.5i 2i 3i 4i 5i 6i
.nf
	LIBFB_CFILES	=
	LIBFB_OBJS	=
	LIBFB_CONFIG	=
.fi
.sp
If this is an SGI system of release 3.5, the display is configured by:
.sp
.nf
	LIBFB_CFILES	= if_sgi.c
	LIBFB_OBJS	= if_sgi.o
	LIBFB_CONFIG	= -DIF_SGI
.fi
.sp
If this is an SGI system of release 3.4 or earlier with Excelan TCP
support, the display can be supported by:
.sp
.nf
	LIBFB_CFILES	= if_sgi.c
	LIBFB_OBJS	= if_sgi.o sgiselect.o
	LIBFB_CONFIG	= -DIF_SGI
.fi
.sp
When using the framebuffer library on the SGI, it is necessary to modify
certain kernel limits in the binary image of your kernel to be able to
use a large block of shared memory.  Follow the directions in
libfb/if_sgi.c, and then reboot your workstation to allow the changes to
take effect.
.sp
If this is a TCP-capable system, you will want to include the remote
frame-buffer capability;  the defaults already provide for this. If you
are using a system which does not have TCP capability, you must edit the
top-level Makefile and remove the "needed for IF_REMOTE" line in the
"benchmark" rule, to prevent compiling "libpkg", in addition to
configuring in Makefile.defs.  For no remote capability, be certain
that IF_REMOTE \fIet. al.\fR are not defined in the LIBFB_CONFIG lines.
Build a remote-framebuffer-only library with:
.sp
.nf
	LIBFB_CFILES	= if_remote.c
	LIBFB_OBJS	= if_remote.o ../libpkg/pkg.o
	LIBFB_CONFIG	= -DIF_REMOTE
.fi
.sp
To offer in-bound remote framebuffer service, you may wish to compile
"rfbd", the remote-framebuffer daemon. If you wish to do this, you must
also add the IF_REMOTE capability to libfb. If your system does not support
inetd(8), then rfbd should be started in /etc/rc.local. However, if your
system does support inetd(8), then rfbd must be started with this
/etc/inetd.conf entry:
.sp
.nf
remotefb stream tcp     nowait  nobody  /usr/brl/etc/rfbd       rfbd
.sp
This depends on having a ``nobody'' user, so be certain that your
/etc/passwd file contains a line like this.  (The choice of UID and
GID of -2 is intentional).
.sp
nobody:*:-2:-2:NFS Unprivileged user:/nonexistent:/dev/null
.sp
Also, be certain to add this line to /etc/services:
.sp
remotefb        5558/tcp                        # Remote Frame Buffer
.fi
.sp
Note that systems with multiple display devices, or for systems that
have a display and also wish to use the remote capability, multiple
entries should be made.  For example, on
a TCP-capable SGI system of release 3.5, the typical configuration is:
.sp
.nf
	LIBFB_CFILES	= if_sgi.c if_remote.c
	LIBFB_OBJS	= if_sgi.o if_remote.o ../libpkg/pkg.o
	LIBFB_CONFIG	= -DIF_SGI -DIF_REMOTE
.fi
.sp
As distributed, the remote, Adage, and Pseudo-tty (Teletype DMD 5620)
interfaces are all enabled.  You will almost certainly wish to change
this;  failure to do so is the most common source of difficulties in
installing this distribution. If you change the configuration of libfb
partway through building the system, be certain to run "cd libfb; make
clean; make depend" before recompiling other programs, because the
Makefiles and binaries change based on the configuration options in
Makefile.defs.
.sp
The file h/rle.h has a #if statement that will need modification if
your machine is a "Little-Endian" machine and your machine is not
a VAX.  "Big-Endian" machines will work without modification.
A Big-Endian machine has byte [0] on the left of the word, like IBM,
while a Little-Endian machine has byte [0] on the right side of the word,
like DEC.  Some of the RLE code needs to know.
.sp
The MGED (multi-device model editor) needs to be configured.
At present, all versions of MGED have support for these types of
display devices by default:
.TS
center box;
l l.
plot	any UNIX-plot filter
tek	Tektronix 4014 and family
tek4109	Tektronix 4109
.TE
These optional display devices are also supported,
when specifically configured:
.TS
center box;
l l.
ir	SGI IRIS 2400, 3030
sunpw	SUN 3.2 Pixwin
vg	Vector General 3300
mg	Megatek 7250
rat	Raster Tech One/80
ps	E&S Picture System 300
mer	Megatek Merlin 9200 [Marginal]
sab	Saber w/GOPS [Marginal]
.TE
Necessary vendor-supplied libraries must be listed on the MGED_LIBES line.
.sp
To configure just the default set of displays, specify:
.sp
.nf
.ta 0.5i 2i 3i 4i 5i 6i
	MGED_CFILES	=
	MGED_OBJS	=
	MGED_CONFIG	=
	MGED_LIBES	=
.sp
To configure an SGI Iris ("ir") running 3.5 with TCP networking, specify:
.sp
	MGED_CFILES	= dm-ir.c
	MGED_OBJS	= dm-ir.o
	MGED_CONFIG	= -DDM_IR
	MGED_LIBES	= -lbsd -lgl2
.sp
To configure an SGI Iris ("ir") running 3.5 with XNS networking, specify:
.sp
	MGED_CFILES	= dm-ir.c
	MGED_OBJS	= dm-ir.o
	MGED_CONFIG	= -DDM_IR -DNONBLOCK
	MGED_LIBES	= -lbsd -lgl2
.sp
To configure an SGI Iris ("ir") running 3.4, specify:
.sp
	MGED_CFILES	= dm-ir.c
	MGED_OBJS	= dm-ir.o
	MGED_CONFIG	= -DDM_IR
	MGED_LIBES	= ../libfb/sgiselect.o -lgl2
.sp
To configure a SUN, specify:
.sp
	MGED_CFILES	= dm-sunpw.c
	MGED_OBJS	= dm-sunpw.o
	MGED_CONFIG	= -DDM_SUNPW
	MGED_LIBES	= -lsuntool -lsunwindow -lpixrect
.fi
and remember always to run MGED under a gfxtool window.
.sp
In all cases,
be certain to properly define the MGED_VERS variable.
.sp
If this is a System V machine, you will also have to edit
the top level Makefile to remove rfbd, libpkg, and fbed
from the PRODUCTS list.
.sp
There are several portions of the "make all" sequence that generate
messages that might appear to be errors, but are actually intentional.
It is regretable that we are not yet able to suppress these.
Any instances of the message "**** Error code 1 (ignored)" are not
actual errors, but are by-products of the Makefile using the
test(1) command to configure itself.
Another non-error message is:
.nf
---------- h
make  -  -f ../Makefile.defs -f Makefile.loc -f ../Makefile.rules depend
make -k -  -f ../Makefile.defs -f Makefile.loc -f ../Makefile.rules
Too many command lines for `clobber'
echo "No clobbering the header files"
No clobbering the header files
.fi
.sp
On the Silicon Graphics, when building libfb, these three messages are
harmless:
.nf
ranlib: warning: libfb.a(oldbbox.o): no symbol table
ranlib: warning: libfb.a(oldfont.o): no symbol table
ranlib: warning: libfb.a(stopwatch.o): no symbol table
.fi
.sp
.IP "IMAGE DISPLAY"
.sp
If you have a suitable framebuffer, you will probably wish to
display the images generated by the benchmark, and compare them
to the reference images.  A pix(5) file is a sequence of \fBunsigned char\fR
triples written RGB in the range 0 to 255.  The first pixel goes in
the lower left corner of the screen, and subsequent pixels write to the
right; subsequent scan lines are displayed above earlier ones.  (First
quadrant display).  See doc/pix.5 for more details.
.sp
Programs for dealing with images are in the "util" directory. To display
a pix(5) file on a framebuffer, set environment variable FB_FILE
(see brlcad(1) for details), and run:
.sp
.nf
	cd bench
	pix-fb moss.pix
.fi
.sp
If the images computed on your machine do not match the reference images,
the program "util/pixdiff" will compute a pix file that will highlight
the differences for you, and report a summary of bytes equal, off-by-1,
and off-by-many, eg,
.sp
.nf
	pixdiff moss.pix ../pix/moss.pix \| pix-fb
.fi
.sp
For a display of the relative magnitude of the differences at
each pixel, use "util/bwdiff" instead, eg,
.sp
.nf
	bwdiff moss.pix ../pix/moss.pix \| pix-fb
or
	bwdiff moss.pix ../pix/moss.pix \| \\
	bwmod -s 128 -m 4 -a 128 \| pix-fb
.fi
.sp
and for statistics on the differences, use
.sp
.nf
	bwdiff moss.pix ../pix/moss.pix \| pixstat
.fi
.sp
.IP "ENHANCEMENTS"
.sp
It is expected that new releases of this software will be issued roughly
semi-annually. Information about new releases will be routinely provided
to recipients of this software.  If your address changes, please let us
know, so we can update our records.
.sp
If you develop additional software for the BRL CAD environment that
you would be willing to share, please send it to us for inclusion
in the next release.
The first such inclusion is the Utah Raster Toolkit, included "as is"
in the directory utah-raster.  Note that the current BRL CAD
distribution uses Edition-2 of the Utah RLE file format, while the
Utah Raster Toolkit uses Edition-3.  In a subsequent release, all
the BRL CAD tools will have been converted to use the Edition-3
format and library interface.  Image conversion aids exist in the
programs utah-raster/get/getfb.c to display Edition-3 RLE images
on libfb supported displays, and utah-raster/tools/jwp/pixtorle.c
to convert pix(5) images into Edition-3 RLE images.
Note that BRL considers the RLE format a long-term image storage format,
with pix(5) format used for image manipulation, while Utah uses RLE
format for all manipulation stages as well.
.sp
.IP "ADDING SUPPORT FOR NEW DISPLAYS"
.sp
If you desire to add support for a new display, there are only two
modules that you will have to create.  The first will be for the
framebuffer library (see libfb(3) for more details).  A template for
creating interfaces to new devices is provided as libfb/if_TEMPLATE.c.
The second module needed is an MGED display manager, like mged/dm-XX.c.
Here, the task is somewhat harder, as two major modes of behavior are
supported:  displaylist and refresh.  You should examine display
managers for devices similar to yours, and proceed from there.
.sp
.IP "UPGRADING FROM RELEASE 1.20"
.sp
This release contains only minor external changes from Release 1.20,
but for complete safety, you should save the old binary to "conv/g2asc",
so that if you find the binary format of the database incompatable
you can convert your old databases from binary to ASCII form. Having to
do this is system dependent (only Sun, SGI, and Alliant users are
likely to be affected), but it difficult to recover from without having
saved the old converter.
.sp
.IP "COMMUNICATION"
.sp
You are invited to participate in the BRL CAD software electronic
mailing list, called
.br
.ti +1i
<CAD @ BRL.ARPA>.
.br
Bug reports and discussions of new features
are the main topics;  volume of messages has been light (so far).
Direct your bug reports to this address.  Request a subscription by
sending to
.br
.ti +1i
<CAD-REQUEST @ BRL.ARPA>.
.sp
If you find bugs, please report your experiences.  While BRL makes no
offer of support, we are most interested in hearing about your
experiences.  Electronic mail is vastly preferred over telephone contact.
In the most dire circumstances, you may phone;  1500-1800 Eastern time
is best.  If you don't connect with one of the developers, please
