.SH NAME
nirt \- interactively ray trace an MGED model
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "nirt  [ -M ] [-sv] [ -u " n " ] [ -x " v " ] " "model.g objects ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nirt
operates on the specified
.I objects
in the database
.I model.g,
using
.IR librt (3)
to trace rays according to commands read from the standard input
and producing an ASCII report of the results.
By default, the user can interact with
.I nirt,
repeatedly specifying origination points and directions for rays
and the format and destination for the reports.
Locations may be input and output in either
model coordinates (\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, \fIz\fR)
or view (a.k.a. grid-plane) coordinates (\fIh\fR, \fIv\fR, \fId\fR).
Similarly, direction may be input and output either as
vectors expressed in model coordinates or as
angles of azimuth and elevation.

The
.B -M
option causes
.I nirt
to read the eye point and
either the orientation quaternion (new format)
or the view-rotation matrix (old format) from the standard input,
and fire a single ray from the point in the specified direction.
This option allows
.I nirt
to be called directly from within
.I mged
using the
.BR nirt " and " rrt
commands.
Given the
.B -s
option,
.I nirt
runs in short (that is, non-verbose) mode.
In this mode,
which is useful in a pipeline,
.I nirt
does not print its initial lines of output or the prompt.
The
.B -v
option, on the other hand, causes
.I nirt
to run in verbose mode.
The default is verbose mode,
except if standard input has been redirected,
in which case the default is short mode.
The
.BI -u " n"
option sets the \fIuseair\fR member
of the \fIrt_i\fR structure to \fIn\fR.
See the discussion of the
.I useair
command below.
The
.BI -x " v"
option sets the
.IR librt (3)
debug flags to the hexadecimal bit vector \fIv\fR.
See the discussion of the
.I libdebug
command below.

If there is a file called .nirtrc in the current directory,
otherwise in the user's home directory,
.I nirt
begins by reading from it.  This start-up file may contain any
.I nirt
commands
and is useful for loading predefined states
or initializing actions for output statements.
.SS Commands
.TP 12
.BI "xyz [" "x y z" "]"
Sets the ray origination point to
(\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, \fIz\fR).
If this command is invoked with no arguments,
.I nirt
prints the current ray origination point in model coordinates.
Default is (0, 0, 0).
Changing (\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, \fIz\fR) will change
(\fIh\fR, \fIv\fR, \fId\fR),
according to the current direction vector.
.TP 12
.BI "hv [" "h v" "[" d "]]"
Sets the ray origination point to
(\fIh\fR, \fIv\fR, \fId\fR).
If this command is invoked with only two arguments,
.I nirt
interprets them as \fIh\fR and \fIv\fR,
and \fId\fR retains its previous value.
If invoked with no argument, the command causes
.I nirt
to print the current ray origination point in view coordinates.
Default is (0, 0, 0).
Changing (\fIh\fR, \fIv\fR, \fId\fR) will change
(\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, \fIz\fR),
according to the current direction vector.
.TP 12
.BI "dir [" "dx dy dz" "]"
Sets the direction vector to the unit vector in direction
(\fIdx\fR, \fIdy\fR, \fIdz\fR).
If this command is invoked with no arguments,
.I nirt
prints the current direction vector.
Default is (\-1, 0, 0).
Changing (\fIdx\fR, \fIdy\fR, \fIdz\fR) will change
the azimuth and elevation angles.
.TP 12
.BI "ae [" "az el" "]"
Sets the direction vector to point
.I from
azimuth = \fIaz\fR and elevation = \fIel\fR.
If this command is invoked with no arguments,
.I nirt
prints the current values of the azimuth and elevation angles.
Default is (0, 0).
Changing azimuth and elevation will change the direction vector.
.TP 12
.B s
Fires a ray from the current origination point in the current direction.
.TP 12
.B backout
Backs the ray origination point out of the geometry:
.IR h " and " v
retain their previous values and
.I d
is set to
.I Dmax,
the largest value of
.I d
anywhere in the geometry.
.TP 12
.BI "useair [" n "]"
Sets the \fIuseair\fR member
of the \fIrt_i\fR structure to the integer \fIn\fR.
If \fIn\fR is 0, then
.I nirt
ignores any air in the geometry.
If this command is invoked with no arguments,
.I nirt
prints the current value of
.I useair.
Default is 0.
.TP 12
.BI "units [" u "]"
Causes
.I nirt
to read and write all distances and locations in units of \fIu\fR.
Valid choices for \fIu\fR are ``mm,'' ``cm,'' ``m,'' ``in,'' and ``ft.''
If this command is invoked with no arguments,
.I nirt
prints the current choice of I/O units.
Default is the units of
.I model.g.
.TP 12
.BI "fmt [" "t format item item ..." "]"
Sets the action for output statements of type \fIt\fR.
If this command is invoked with only one argument,
a valid statement type,
.I nirt
prints the current format and items for the specified type.
See the discussion of output statements below.
.TP 12
.BI "dest [" d "]"
Sets the destination for subsequent output actions to \fId\fR.
If the first character of \fId\fR is `|',
then
\fId\fR is interpreted as a pipeline to which to write its output.
Otherwise if \fId\fR is the string ``default,''
.I nirt
sets the destination to the standard output.
Otherwise \fId\fR is interpreted as a file.
In any event, \fId\fR is not closed until the user quits
.I nirt
or resets the destination by another invocation of the
.I dest
command.
If this command is invoked with no arguments,
.I nirt
prints the current value of \fId\fR.
Default is ``default,'' that is, the standard output.
.TP 12
.BI "statefile [" f "]"
Sets the name of the state file to which to dump
and from which to load state information.
See the discussion of the
.IR dump " and " load
commands below.
If this command is invoked with no arguments,
.I nirt
prints the current name of the state file.
Default is ``nirt_state.''
.TP 12
.B dump
Writes state information to the state file.
The ray origination point and direction vector,
useair, units, destination, and all the output actions are dumped.
.TP 12
.B load
Reads state information from the state file.
The state file loaded may contain any
.I nirt
commands.
.TP 12
.BI print " item"
Prints the current value of the output item \fIitem\fR.
See the discussion of output statements below.
.TP 12
.BI libdebug " v"
Sets the
.IR librt (3)
debug flags
(the \fIdebug\fR member of the \fIrt_g\fR structure)
to the hexadecimal bit vector \fIv\fR.
These flags control the amount and kind of diagnostic print statements
.IR librt (3)
executes.
If \fIv\fR is 0,
then no diagnostics are produced.
If this command is invoked with no arguments,
.I nirt
prints the current value of \fIv\fR
and the names of any of its bits that are set.
Default is 0.
.TP 12
.BI "! [" command "]"
Executes the shell pipeline
.I command.
If this command is invoked with no arguments,
.I nirt
spins off a subshell, executing the program named in the environment variable
SHELL.
.TP 12
.B ?
Prints a help menu to the standard output.
.TP 12
.B q
Quits
.I nirt.
.SS Output Statements
.I Nirt
allows the user a high degree of control,
via the
.I fmt
command,
over what information gets printed out for each ray and in what format.
There are six types of output statement,
each of which is executed under appropriate circumstances.
The types and their use are:
.TP
.B r
Ray.
The first output statement executed
whenever the
.I s
command is invoked.
.TP
.B h
Head.
Executed immediately after the ray statement
if the ray hits anything.
.TP
.B p
Partition.
Executed once for each partition along the ray
if the ray hits anything.
.TP
.B f
Foot.
The last output statement executed
if the ray hits anything.
.TP
.B m
Miss.
Executed immediately after the ray statement
if the ray hits nothing.
.TP
.B o
Overlap.
Executed once for each overlap along the ray
if the ray hits anything.
.P
The action associated with each output statement type is essentially a
.IR printf (3)
statement,
with a format string and a list of output items.
The items may be chosen from a set of values that
.I nirt
updates according to user commands and location along the ray.
These values may be categorized as pertaining to the entire ray,
partitions along the ray,
or overlaps.
The values are explained in the following table.

.SH HINTS
Ray origination coordinates specified with the
.I hv
command are immediately converted for internal use
to model coordinates,
according to the current direction vector.
If you want to change the ray direction and origination point,
and you're using view coordinates,
you probably want to change the ray direction
.I before
you use the
.I hv
command.

The name ``nirt'' stands for ``Natalie's interactive ray tracer.''
.SH DEFINITIONS
The usage in
.I nirt
of the following terms corresponds to that found in
.IR mged (1)
and elsewhere throughout BRL CAD.
We provide the definitions here for reference.
.SS View Coordinates
We define the view coordinate system
(more precisely its basis vectors \fBm\fR, \fBn\fR, and \fBo\fR)
in terms of the basis vectors
\fBi\fR, \fBj\fR, and \fBk\fR
of the model coordinate system as follows:
.in +5m

\fBm\fR is the opposite of the direction vector and corresponds to \fId\fR,
.br
\fBn\fR = \fBk\fR \(mu \fBm\fR corresponds to \fIh\fR, and
.br
\fBo\fR = \fBm\fR \(mu \fBn\fR corresponds to \fIv\fR.

.in -5m
Thus if the direction vector is (\-1, 0, 0),
then
(\fId\fR, \fIh\fR, \fIv\fR) =
(\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, \fIz\fR).
.SS Azimuth and Elevation
Azimuth is the angle measured around \fBk\fR (right-hand rule)
from the \fIxz\fR plane to \fBm\fR.
Elevation is the angle measured toward \fBk\fR
from the \fIxy\fR plane to \fBm\fR.
.SH FILES
 .nirtrc \h12m run-time configuration file
.SH SEE ALSO
mged(1), librt(3), printf(3)
.SH BUGS
The program sometimes complains about ``previously unreported overlaps.''
To the best of our knowledge, this complaint may be safely ignored.
We hope to fix this soon.
