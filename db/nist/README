            MBE PMI Validation and Conformance Testing Models

                            December 2013

NIST has created a Test System to measure conformance of Computer-Aided Design
(CAD) to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards for Product
and Manufacturing Information (PMI), specifically geometric dimensioning and
tolerancing (GD&T) information.

As part of this Test System, CAD Models were prepared.
