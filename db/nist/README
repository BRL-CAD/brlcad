December 2014:

The files in this directory are conversions of the NIST MBE PMI test models
into the AP203 file format.  These conversions are also in the public domain.

Originals are from http://www.nist.gov/el/msid/infotest/mbe-pmi-validation.cfm

Models 7 through 10 have been assembled into a single file, guided by the example
PDF provided with the original NIST data set.

            MBE PMI Validation and Conformance Testing Models

NIST has created a Test System to measure conformance of Computer-Aided Design
(CAD) to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards for Product
and Manufacturing Information (PMI), specifically geometric dimensioning and
tolerancing (GD&T) information.

As part of this Test System, CAD Models were prepared.
