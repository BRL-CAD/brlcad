    mColors needs an array of entries, not just one
    
    If I'm following the Asset Import logic correctly, it's looking for a
    per-vertex array of entries here, not just a single entry.  We were
    seeing crashing on GhostBSD in release mode, and valgrind in debug mode
    was flagging reads from here with the previous assignment.

    Test a method for bot vertex fusing
    
    The Asset Import "x" regression test is producing an "arb4" bot that is
    plate mode and not sharing vertices.  Intuitively we ought to be able to
    "fuse" this into a proper arb4 solid.
    
    This can be done with the sequence:
    
    bot set type unnamed.s solid
    bot_fuse tetra.s unnamed.s
    
    but that logic goes through libnmg and it's not clear how well it would
    scale.  I was curious to see if a simple vertex binning approach might
    be able to achieve a similar result, which is what this code implements.
    It's a "quick and dirty" test so far, so not announcing as a user
    feature for now.

    short term fix to area computation when there are iterations.
    
    we need to know the total number of samples to divide properly, and we're not currently tracking that so just reset the stats each loop for now so it's at least right.

    clarify some of the variable names and comments to make it more clear.
    
    there are some points where we're referring to the number of hits along a given shotline (i.e., in+out) and other times, we're only concerned with whether the ray encountered a hit or not.  for area purposes, it obviously matters which of those we're dealing with.

    Looks like it's just rtweight that needs this
    
    rtarea is writing to stderr.  Also, if we try to listen to both stdout
    and stderr for rtweight, when running rtweight on M35 component with the
    GQA_SAMPLE_DENSITIES file imported for densities the output hangs.  If
    we need to pick one for now, go with stdout.

    Only handle stdout for the TXT mode rt commands
    
    We don't want to interfere with the use of stdout by embedded rt et.
    al., but we want the full txt output for rtweight and rtarea.
    
    Note that this has another problem - if rtweight has a very verbose
    output, we end up waiting on a read...

    bext is using a newer opennurbs than src/other, and it looks like the .g
    file size difference between the older and newer versions is
    significant.  Update the test function to allow specifying a local
    expected delta in lieu of the 3% default.

    it started failing recently because we weren't previously matching on #elif lines and a reordering in libbu made a platform symbol suddenly be seen.  this should catch more of the possible conditions, so our counts may go up further still.  this should be a more accurate (and now documented) match now catching more C/C++ and CMake cases.

    document the different modes, offer a threshold option, more.
    
    make it so specifying a sample count shoots only that many samples without iterating. also cut memory usage down by not using xrays, instead just defining our own (76 to 48 bytes per ray), and reducing peak memory usage by releasing our points before shooting.

    Teach bot extrude to produce volumetric BoT output
    
    Rather than the large CSG tree originally produced by bot extrude, take
    advantage of the new Manifold library's capabilities to make an
    explicitly evaluated volumetric BoT by doing facetization of the
    individual CSG elements and then evaluating the unions.
    
    This can be quite slow - the boolean problem is a difficult one, with
    thousands of elements even for modestly sized meshes - so users should
    allow for that when preparing to convert large numbers of plate mode
    solids.  For example, the FAA's Generic_Twin example in BRL-CAD takes
    about an hour to complete a conversion of all its plate mode BoTs to
    volumetric BoTs.
    
    Bringing this work over from the facetize branch, since it doesn't
    require Geogram or any of the new facetize logic itself.

    make the annotative geometry a bit bigger.
    
    also don't need to iterate all partitions, just the first in and last out point.  interestingly, we could probably get a good estimate of the entire surface area if we accounted for all surfaces, but the focus for now is exterior surface area only.

    back to 0.1%, though percentage by itself is inadequate.
    
    depends heavily on the random sampling, if we get a good set or not.  we might also randomly get a result very close to the previous, which might still be far from the ground truth.

    woo hoo, working like a charm.
    
    new method is based on montecarlo integration, randomly sampling rays through the bounding volume and using cauchy-crofton estimation to determine area based solely on the number of hits.  this appears to work very well, providing precise results for sphere and box test cases with known areas.

    Make the dbconcat man page easier to use.
    
    Add an options table, adjust the explanation of what the implications of
    affix, suffix and straight import are.
    
    The behavior of this command needs to be improved - we should be
    capable of maintaining the integrity of imported combs through renaming
    automatically, rather than requiring hunting around with dup to find
    a non-conflicting affix string for the purpose.

    Allow for importing of empty BoT objects
    
    There's no inherent reason as far as I can see that we can't have an empty BoT
    object - Boolean operations may generate such things to distinguish between a
    failed operation and one that legitimately results in a zero volume evaluation.
    Intermediate bot editing states could also conceivably result in an empty bot
    needing to serve as a placeholder getting written in and out during user
    modification.  At any rate, don't flag this as an import error - the routine is
    reading in the information from disk correctly.

    missing cmake checks for bu_thread_id's syscall method.
    
    we don't get syscall() declared in our c11 compilation mode as it's a gnu extension, but can use it if its available.  interestingly, we were apparently falling through to other thread id methods.  we probably should have some asserts to make sure the ID is expected (positive number).

    removed the non-merzenne twister spherical sampling during ao rendering.
    
    while slower, there's not a use case where you want ao but would be okay with the pattern artifacts from the fast random number generator.  this change leaves the ambSlow variable to allow time for scripts to transition without hitting an error, but it's a no-op.  simplifies usability and docs.

    were removed from the librt-static.lib on MS Windows

    fix rtweight printing inside mged
    
    rtweight was only printing stderr output when run inside mged despite
    writing to both stderr and stdout - add an io hook for stdout. Also,
    since _ged_rt_output_handler() is setup to handle BOTH stderr and
    stdout, we need to restructure slightly so that successful reads are
    printed to the console before the next overwrites the buffer.

    Add support for prefixing to plot3.h
    
    In order to allow libbg to use plot3.h independently of libbv and not cause
    problems when static linking with other libs, use the same trick we use for
    zlib and allow for a custom prefix.  In the libbg uses of plot3 we define a
    separate libbg specific prefix, and for all other code just use the default
    behavior.  This should allow libbg to define PLOT3_IMPLEMENTATION without
    causing conflicts with libbv's use of PLOT3_IMPLEMENTATION, but needs to be
    tested.

    rtwizard option reworded

    add a script that characterizes a surface area metric based off of presented area and edge rendering information.
    
    the script uses rtedge, rtarea, rtwizard, pixcount, and imagemagick to compose an image with metrics that characterize external surface area complexity.  this complexity metric can be views as a proxy for surface area.  using edge information, and some baked-in notions of time/effort, we could even give a rough order of magnitude effort estimate for what it'd take to go over the surface (e.g., to paint it,  wash it, apply coatings, examine, etc).  everything is generated automatically and composited (with labels) via  imagemagick tools.

    massive overhaul of rtwizards option printing.
    
    turns out, there was a bug where -h simply displayed all options in triplicate.  now correctly filters to a subset, with subsets reorganized and ordered according to functionality, priority, and simplicity of presentation.  Should be a lot easier for a passing user to set up a valid rendering via command line.

    db_search returns, keep track of the items printed and report that for
    the total count.

    added/expanded torus ray tracing support to include self-intersecting tori.
    
    this lets the torus definition extend past a horn torus to a spindle torus with self-intersection.  this allow for the full spectrum of positive radius parings (major and minor).

Date:   Sat Feb 3 23:27:19 2024 -0500

    add support for self-intersecting torus.
    
    this extends support for defining and editing torus so that the minor radius (r_h aka r2) can be bigger than the major radius (r_a aka r1).  intersection logic is updated to report hits correctly (i.e., only one segment through the overlapped interior).  leaving plotting as-is since it is useful for the user to have some visual cue.
    
    this helps improve usability a smidge so objects can be edited through a larger spectrum of valid values, and supports definition of some shapes that are otherwise impossible with the implicits.

    Undo 'y' argv filter from 4b6850a671
    
    Unfortunately, this filter breaks MGED command line processing.  The
    following command illustrates the problem:
    
    ./bin/mged share/db/axis.g l y
    
    It should print out the info for the 'y' TGC, but the filter strips out
    the 'y' primitive name and it never reaches the 'l' routine.
    
    We'll need to find another way to handle the "unrecognized command"
    errors.

    Use realpath for a more robust dbi_filepath entry
    
    This has been driving me nuts for ages... The terra.g terrain example
    won't work if you open it with a relative path, i.e.:
    
    ./bin/mged share/db/terra.g
    
    You get:
    
    mapped file open failure: ./terra.bin
    
    unless the working directory for MGED happens to be the same directory
    as the .g file.  Digging into it a little, the mechanism that opens the
    dsp is actually smart about looking relative to the .g file path, but
    only when the .g path is fully qualified - i.e., specifying something
    like /usr/brlcad/rel-7.38.0/share/db/terra.g DOES work.
    
    For better robustness, use bu_file_realpath to resolve such paths before
    doing the dbi_filepath assignment.  This allows us to find terra.bin
    even with the "./bin/mged share/db/terra.g" command launch, and won't
    cause any changes if the full path is already specified.

    Per upstream, STL won't cut it for capturing inputs for debugging - need to do this right.  Since we already use assimp for gcv, it should be possible.

    Use spheres and cylinders to fill in bot extrude
    
    Not 100% sure how well this will work, but attempt to "fill in" the gaps
    left by extruding bot face arb6 primitives straight out with cylinders
    and rccs.  Subtracting a plate mode bot from this comb won't result in
    an empty raytrace, since the result defines solid volumes extruding out
    from the edges perpendicular to the plane of the faces, but arguably
    that's OK as those volumes can be interpreted as being in the "solidity
    depends on interrogation angle" ambiguities inherent to the plate mode
    methodology.
    
    In theory it may be possible to use facetize to evaluate this and
    actually get an evaluated mesh, but initial experiments suggest that for
    anything beyond fairly trivial surfaces the boolean eval will be
    prohibitively expensive even if it succeeds.

    Remove the NEWS writeup mention of gist
    
    Chris and I both tried, but something about our bext opencv build is
    giving us linking errors on Windows so we can't roll binaries with it
    included.  Leaving the NEWS line, as it is available to build if a
    system OpenCV is available.
