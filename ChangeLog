	  move the 7 features cliff back-ported down into the 7.24.2
	  release section. reword for clarity and to remove the dev
	  perspective. these features of mged and rtwizard were nearly all
	  worked in response to user requests (baker et al).

	  mohit changed some of the image conversion tools (like pix-bw)
	  that took an -R/-G/-B option that optionally took a weight value,
	  to now require the weight value (previous implicit was
	  weight=1.0).

	* [r60672] NEWS:
	  keith improved pipe ray tacing in r57269 where there was an error
	  in grazing cases where you have legitimate in/out hits on same
	  surface but less than 0.00001 dist. per his description: For the
	  pipe we don't expect to hit the same surface within such a small
	  distance unless it is a grazing case in which we really want to
	  remove both hits. Also changed the hardcoded '0.00001' constant
	  to the internal distance tolerence. Also removed related
	  conditional that reported the original error and bailed.

	* [r60617] src/libfb/if_X24.c:
	  document what this little bit of magic is actually doing. it's
	  setting up a luminance conversion table (ironically for 8-bit and
	  1-bit greyscale displays) where values are factored by three
	  precise factors (0.299, 0.587, 0.114) but we do the math here in
	  integer space to avoid floating point error accumulation (and
	  perhaps originally for performance too). this commit changes the
	  loop to not multiply table values, instead accumulating them via
	  addition, which should hopefully avoid the gcc 4.8.1 error that
	  Tom encountered. credit to Widelands (sigra, r3180) for the
	  method that improves upon our initialization. gotta love open
	  source round tripping.

	  It looks like the default initial rtwizard window size wasn't

2013-10-14 13:26  d_rossberg

	* [r58167] src/other/tclap/config.h.in:
	  Special configuration for MSVC++: MS Windows isn't an officially
	  supported platform for TCLAP. The library uses autotools/make
	  which isn't available with Visual Studio. Nevertheless TCLAP was
	  made compilable in Visual Studio with an "#ifdef _MSC_VER". This
	  behavior has to be simulated in BRL-CAD's CMake configuration.

2013-10-11 00:00  brlcad

	* [r58158] src/libbu/progname.c:
	  and what we really want is to use bu_progname if it's been set,
	  treating bu_setprogname() as the new argv0, so only using
	  program_invocation_name if the caller never called
	  bu_setprogname(). it's a fallback.

2013-10-10 23:55  brlcad

	* [r58157] src/libbu/progname.c:
	  another issue, unclear whether intentional or not but if we have
	  program_invocation_name, only use it if the bu_progname buffer
	  doesn't already have a full path recorded (from bu_setprogname())

2013-10-10 23:28  brlcad

	* [r58156] src/libbu/progname.c:
	  cliff encountered a bug that I even thought about when rewriting
	  all of this but forgot to revisit. if you call bu_getprogname()
	  even once, it will wipe out a full-path setting and
	  bu_argv0_full_path() will only work if the progname is in the
	  PATH. this fix stashes the result in a local buffer before
	  returning (in leu of creating another static global).

	* [r57311] src/libbu/heap.c:
	  go even a little more conservative with the page sizes as we get
	  started since more testing is needed with the bu_malloc
	  implementation change (posix_memalign()+memset() means pages are
	  actually REAL and written to. this makes the pages just 65k.

2013-08-30 07:37  brlcad

	* [r57310] src/libbu/vls_vprintf.c:
	  address the additional test cases that were not being handled
	  where the %s format specifier had precision and/or field lengths
	  specified for left/right padded alignment. the code was written
	  to account for the padding, but it wasn't actually being called
	  because the lengths weren't captured. we don't want to capture
	  them in the earlier loop because it screws up assumptions for
	  some of the other specifier cases. this fixes sf bug #347
	  reported by lee butler (bu_log does not honor string field
	  widths).

	* [r57305] src/libbu/tests/bu_heap.c:
	  test is being a pig, only releasing a little bit of the memory
	  allocated. test needs to change so it actually compares heap
	  against malloc.

	* [r57304] src/libbu/tests/CMakeLists.txt:

2013-08-30 03:52  brlcad

	* [r57303] src/libbu/tests/bu_vls_vprintf.c:
	  per sf bug report 347, add a slew of %s tests for field
	  width/precision specifiers that are failing. the code clearly
	  looks like it should be handling this case, but clearly something
	  isn't getting set right. looks like it always just prints the
	  string plain.

	* [r57269] src/librt/primitives/pipe/pipe.c:
	  Changed logic in the 'pipe' solid raytracing code in function
	  rt_pipe_elim_dups(). This code removed single hit from hit list
	  when next hit dist < 0.00001 and next hit from same surface. This
	  caused an error in grazing cases where you have legitimate in/out
	  hits on same surface but less than 0.00001 dist. For the pipe we
	  don't expect to hit the same surface within such a small distance
	  unless it is a grazing case in which we really want to remove
	  both hits. Also changed the hardcoded '0.00001' constant to the
	  internal distance tolerence. Also removed related conditional
	  that reported the original error and bailed.

	  src/librt/primitives/bot/tieprivate.h:
	  Fix 32-bit TIE. The problem was someone trying to be far too
	  clever packing bits into a pointer address. You read that right.
	  Bits were being set/unset and read from WITHIN the pointer VALUE.
	  Even remember telling Justin many many years ago this would be a
	  problem, but obviously nothing came of that. My vague
	  recollection was that he was hijacking particular bits that were
	  always zero given particular struct allocation sizes. Of course,
	  this is incredibly presumptuous and volatile to struct member
	  type sizes, 32-bit vs 64-bit compilation, implicit
	  padding/alignment issues, and more.
	  
	  This gets TIE working on 32-bit compilation (and generally more
	  portably all around) by extracting those bit values that were
	  being packed into their own struct element (for both the kdtree
	  and the tri structs) where this was happening. This took quite a
	  bit of very cautious surgery to extract and propagate the bits
	  correctly. There may be more needed (e.g., didn't test
	  single-precision), but seems to work swell in all the tests I
	  threw at it. Made (probably unnecessarily) most of the memory
	  allocation zero-initialize just for good measure too.

2013-08-13 02:53  brlcad

	* [r56767] include/tie.h:
	  since TIE tries to be coherent, document the sizes of each of the
	  struct elements and ensure that we stay on 4-byte boundaries.
	  ironically shows that several core data structs do not fit within
	  a cache line when using double-precision, so this is far from
	  optimal. related and most significantly, I'm adding two new 'b'
	  fields (on tie_tri_s and tie_kdtree_s) to hold kd-tree data.
	  reason why will become apparent in the next commit.

	  enable stack protection for non-optimized debug-enabled builds.
	  for gcc 4.1+ this is -fstack-protector-all, for clang it's
	  -qstackprotect. wouldn't think we need both, but would need to
	  check the c/cxx flags independently otherwise in case the caller
	  is compiling c with clang and cxx with g++ (for example). easier
	  to just check them both to handle such situations.

	  fix a bug when checking C and CXX flags sequentially, the latter

	  CC: unrecognized option '-Qunused-argument' messages (which is
	  apparently not a valid C++ flag, but is valid for C) and
	  potentially any other flag where the result should be different
	  (obviously).

2013-08-09 18:40  brlcad

	* [r56718] include/raytrace.h:

	  provide an interface for managing the summary/logging output,
	  allowing calling applications to register a printing function
	  (such as printf, bu_log, puts, etc). instead of tying the
	  printing to bu_debug being set, read the BU_HEAP_PRINT

2013-08-02 15:25  starseeker

	* [r56473] src/gtools/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/gtools/beset/CMakeLists.txt:
	  In order for beset to work with the LOCAL flag (which a recent
	  change rolled in with NO_INSTALL) it needs to have its build
	  target in the beset subdirectory - otherwise, the binary output
	  name conflicts with the directory in the gtools build dir holding
	  the beset information. Should fix the in-src-dir build.

2013-08-02 14:16  starseeker

	* [r56468] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  Have rtweight handle outfp locally based on the options. Not sure
	  if this is the 'correct' fix given the problem was somehow
	  introduced in r56243 (not sure why yet) but it does seem to make
	  sense and gets regress passing again.

	* [r56451] doc/docbook/system/mann/en/comb.xml, src/libged/comb.c:
	  Add initial stab at implementation of the 'lift region' option to
	  comb (-l) that clears out all region flags below the specified
	  combination and sets the region flag on the specified
	  combination. If a region is used in another tree, this option
	  uses the wrapping functionality to swap regions for combs in the
	  local tree while preserving the region's properites elsewhere,
	  except when doing so would yank the region flag out from a comb
	  that is defining something in another tree. (basic option is
	  described in man page, examples will be added to clarify.)

	  src/conv/stl/g-stl.c:
	  apply Jonathan's patch from
	  https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/195/ - updated the usage
	  strings and man pages, and made them a little more readable

2013-07-30 08:40  mohitdaga

	* [r56320] src/libicv/fileformat.c:
	  Remove comments of old declaration of icv_image_save_close(..).
	  New implementation of icv_image_save doesnot require return
	  values related to file discriptor since icv_image struct doesnt
	  contain fd information anymore. And icv_image_save() always opens
	  and closes the image on success.

2013-07-30 05:32  brlcad

	* [r56319] src/libicv/fileformat.c:
	  this is a brand new library. we can't get off the ground with
	  fixed limits already getting introduced unnecssarily.

2013-07-30 05:20  brlcad

	* [r56318] include/icv.h, src/libicv/fileformat.c, src/rt/do.c:
	  while these types should not be undocumented to begin with (code
	  complete failure), I do not see the point of
	  ICV_IMAGE_AUTO_NO_PIX or passing a type. we can enforce a type
	  using a string convention (e.g. png:mypngfile.out) and basically
	  always be 'inferred'. nix the ICV_IMAGE_AUTO_NO_PIX type for now
	  until a utility can be demonstrated. icv_image_save() should
	  never do nothing.

2013-07-30 05:04  brlcad

	* [r56317] src/rt/view.c:
	  if icv_write_pixel does not require locking elsewhere, why does
	  it require it here?

2013-07-30 05:03  brlcad

	* [r56316] src/libicv/fileformat.c:
	  cleanup, make pix_save a more clear default

2013-07-30 05:02  brlcad

	* [r56315] src/libicv/fileformat.c:
	  ws consistency cleanup

2013-07-30 04:59  brlcad

	* [r56314] src/libicv/fileformat.c:
	  icv_image_save() cannot fail to do what it's told or we'll have
	  to update all possible caller code to have pix fallback recovery
	  code. no reason that cannot happen here. guess the format, but
	  use PIX for anything unrecognized. note some bad fixed-size
	  buffer assumptions already getting introduced.

2013-07-29 20:29  mohitdaga

	* [r56311] include/icv.h:
	  Included a note for icv_image_writeline. This cautions the api
	  caller not to call icv_image_writeline by acquiring
	  BU_SEM_SYSCALL seamaphore.

2013-07-29 20:12  mohitdaga

	* [r56310] src/rt/view.c:
	  Fixed bug in raytracer after applying modified icv. Apparently
	  icv_image_writeline calls bu_malloc for unsigned char data, which
	  in turn acquires the BU_SEM_SYSCALL. Ran benchamark and raytracer
	  runs without errors.

2013-07-29 18:45  mohitdaga

	* [r56309] src/rt/viewedge.c:
	  Fixed bug of rtedge after applying modified icv. Apparently
	  icv_image_writeline usage bu_mallo(..) which in turn acquires
	  semaphore BU_SEM_SYSCALL. Thus there was a deadlock. After
	  removing this semaphore tested on bz with 10,20,30,40,100,500
	  process and resultant image was identical and correct.

	  LIBRT_BOT_MINTIE environment variable. previously, the existing
	  archer preference for that variable would override if a .archerrc
	  file even got saved and users would still have to set the
	  environment variable for sub-process rt/rtedge invocations. now
	  the preference will pass down to sub-processes and it respects
	  the env var if it's set.

	  was loosened for some of the STEP pullbacks). Added
	  utah_pushBack() to previous halfstep loop in newton iterater
	  which tries to fix over stepping. I the IN/OUT BREP stiching
	  logic removed a loop that removed NEAR_HITs on ODD hit counts
	  because it was being done before the remove duplicate points
	  logic. Fixed sign problem on final SBV check of BREP root solver
	  where I added VUNITIZE_TOL.

	* [r56057] src/librt/primitives/rec/rec.c:
	  overhaul the rec shot routine. eliminates a recently introduced
	  magic constant (1.0e10) that wasn't correct (a big root does not
	  indicate a need to check the end plates). completely restructure
	  the logic to eliminate the gotos and the associated spagetti. now
	  we always check the cylinder and end plates, collapsing any
	  duplicate points. these changes were tested extensively with a
	  default rec from all possible orientations showing no change
	  other than face normal on grazing edge. performance was actually
	  faster for most views (but within 5% noise).

	* [r56049] src/rt/do.c:
	  improve the error message when we cannot write to the output

	  permissions denied message.

2013-07-15 04:42  brlcad

2013-07-14 06:11  brlcad

	* [r56035] src/util/bwhisteq.c:
	  remove METHOD2 since zero_level's testing shows that it doesn't
	  appear to be significantly any better, just introduces an
	  off-by-many on matlab comparisons due to the random weighting.

2013-07-13 03:17  brlcad

	  accept sf patch #187 Code Reduction in bwhisteq-2
	  (https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/187/) from mohit daga
	  that avoids iterating over the bins unnecessarily. cuts two lines
	  overall but more interestingly was compared with an equivalent
	  matlab function. results were nearly identical with differences
	  assumed to be floating point drift/error.

2013-07-13 02:58  brlcad

	* [r56031] src/librt/primitives/brep/brep_debug.cpp:

	  accept sf patch (https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/173/)
	  from Avneet Kaur that refactored a 20+ line duplication in some
	  wireframe drawing code.

2013-07-12 20:42  brlcad

	* [r56028] include/common.h:
	  restructure the logic so that we clearly assert expectation that
	  this header will always be included before system headers. this
	  is particularly important on Windows, thus we should not need
	  pragma warnings. conveniently, it's a few lines shorter and
	  reduces a scope too.

2013-07-12 19:09  brlcad

	* [r56027] src/libbrep/intersect.cpp:
	  we might not care, but implementers of qsort() care, which is
	  what opennurbs ultimately ends up passing this callback to.
	  future We might care too, so cover our bases.

2013-07-12 17:17  brlcad

	* [r56026] CMakeLists.txt, bench/CMakeLists.txt, bench/ref,
	  bench/run.sh, pix:
	  change to a crazy long legacy. now that there are nothing but
	  benchmark reference pix and log files in the top-level pix/

	  remove the other three example images as they're no longer
	  interesting or impressive. if we're to ship demo renderings, we

2013-07-12 06:13  phoenixyjll

	* [r56020] src/libbrep/intersect.cpp:
	  ON_PolylineCurve::IsArc() always returns false, so using it is
	  not sufficient, and the elliptical arc fitting code below will
	  work for this.

2013-07-12 06:11  phoenixyjll

	  Eliminate unnecessary collinear points on the polyline curves.

2013-07-12 05:45  phoenixyjll

	* [r56018] src/libbrep/intersect.cpp:
	  Use max_dis_u (v, s, t) seperately as the scale of their domains
	  may differ a lot.

2013-07-12 02:59  phoenixyjll

	* [r56017] src/libbrep/intersect.cpp:
	  The original code cannot deal with elliptical arcs that cross the

	* [r56016] src/librt/primitives/rec/rec.c:

	* [r55968] src/other/CMakeLists.txt, src/other/step,
	  src/other/step.dist, src/other/stepcode, src/other/stepcode.dist:
	  Move src/other/step to src/other/stepcode in preparation for
	  switching to using the stepcode project sources

	* [r55967] src/librt/primitives/brep/brep_debug.cpp,

	* [r55966] src/libbrep/intersect.cpp:
	  The inverse of the matrix may fail, and actually we don't need to
	  solve a 3*3 system because x+y+z==1. And triangle intersections
	  should handle the cases where the two planes are coincident.

	* [r55965] src/librt/primitives/brep/brep_debug.cpp,
	  src/librt/tests/test_ssi.cpp:
	  Deal with surface-surface intersection points.

2013-07-08 04:16  phoenixyjll

	* [r55964] src/libbrep/intersect.cpp:
	  The distance of a point and a plane may be negative - use fabs().
	  And fix a bug of triangle intersections - update the line_normal
	  for triangle B, and floating points can not use == directly (we
	  use ON_ZERO_TOLERANCE instead). And use the bounding box
	  diagonals to calculate max_dis, as Volumn() might be zero.

	  Nick had a good idea to use the pair map as a way to make an
	  indexed array of edges up front, and then work with arrays after

	  This is less pretty than using edges (doesn't cull all the lines

	* [r55755] src/librt/primitives/brep/brep.cpp:
	  The newton solver iterates until it gets within a program
	  specified closeness tolerance to the ray under consideration. The
	  UV parameters are then checked to determine if they are within
	  the current surface subdivision bounding (SSB) box under
	  evaluation. For rays close to the UV border the solver
	  occasionally fails because it jumps slightly out of its current
	  UV but within the ray closeness tolerance. These rays are usually
	  picked up when evaluating the adjacent SSB but not always. To
	  make sure these valid hit points aren't dropped I've added a
	  slight tolerance (VUNITIZE_TOL) to the UV check. This fix is
	  related to speckling picked up on raytraced images of implicit
	  geometries converted to a BREP.
