	* [r37431] NEWS:
	  this one is a biggie. keith applied a fix to the BoT ray tracing
	  code so that we no longer have a solidity failure when grazing a
	  surface edge. using a FILO in/out collapse, multiple ins are
	  collapsed to the first in, and multiple outs to the last out,
	  making grazing points be considered a full hit. this should fix a
	  bug documented in sf bug 1501921 (Missed volume when raytracing
	  BOTs) reported by Charles Kennedy (g2asc) and Tim Myers where a
	  BoT with stair-step features was causing rays to slip through the
	  mesh if they were perfectly aligned on an edge. this will need
	  additional testing, particularly to see if the FILO approach is
	  'too much' or if other results are affected. if that's the case,
	  a more cumbersome LIFO approach could be taken provided the bot
	  shot() routine is modified appropriately to check neighbors when
	  grazing an edge.

	* [r37383] src/rt/Makefile.am, src/rt/heatgraph.c, src/rt/view.c:
	  Added new file heatgraph.c, which now holds all heat-graph
	  related functions, which have
	  been removed from view.c. Heatgraph also now processes heat graph
	  once render is finished,
	  replacing the framebuffer once calculations are completed.
	  Makefile.am has been updated to
	  include heatgraph.

	* [r37382] include/bu.h:
	  Fix minor typo in bu_vls_strmp comment.

2010-01-21 20:44  brlcad

	* [r37381] NEWS:
	  this release gets another boost to documentation after janine's
	  efforts, to include a special blurb about janine's work, jesica's
	  translations, and cliff's support integrating it all together.

2010-01-21 19:27  irpguardian

	* [r37380] src/rt/view.c:
	  Added semaphores to prevent making of multiple time-tables.
	  Starting to add funtionality to create entire heat-graph at
	  end of render, instead of pixel-by-pixel.

2010-01-21 19:00  brlcad

	* [r37379] NEWS:
	  also increased the maximum line length of edcodes, from 256 to
	  10240. related to the rcodes/wcodes limit cleanup.

2010-01-21 18:57  brlcad

	* [r37378] src/libged/edcodes.c:
	  remove the arbitrary 256 character line length, increase to
	  RT_MAXLINE (which is presently 10240).

2010-01-21 18:56  brlcad

	* [r37377] src/libged/edcodes.c:
	  get rid of all the static variables. pass the ABORT criteria to
	  halt when the hierarchy is too deep as a return value and
	  funcleaf user pointer instead.

2010-01-21 18:44  starseeker

	* [r37376] include/gcv.h:
	  Fix minor gcv.h comment typos.

2010-01-21 18:37  brlcad

	* [r37375] src/libged/edcodes.c:
	  reorganize and cleanup to avoid forward declarations, clean up
	  static func names.

2010-01-21 18:27  starseeker

	* [r37374] doc/docbook/system/README:
	  fix typo in docbook/system README.

2010-01-21 18:25  brlcad

	* [r37373] src/libged/rcodes.c:
	  another magic number, names 256 chars and longer were getting
	  truncated. extend out to RT_MAXLINE as well.

2010-01-21 18:20  brlcad

	* [r37372] NEWS:
	  these are two peas in a pod. increased the maximum path depth
	  supported by wcodes (increased from 12 to 9000) and maximum line
	  length supported by rcodes (increased from 256 to 10240). both in
	  response to a report from Kathy Cook on the brlcad-users mailing
	  list where she ran into both issues.

2010-01-21 18:17  brlcad

	* [r37371] src/libged/rcodes.c:
	  cleanup rcodes and increase the line limit from 256 (...) to
	  RT_MAXLINE (which is presently 10240). needs to be made dynamic
	  (bu_vls), but this should fix one of the issues reported by Kathy
	  Cook to the brlcad-users mailing list.

2010-01-21 18:09  brlcad

	* [r37370] src/libged/wcodes.c:
	  quell all compilation warnings.

2010-01-21 18:08  brlcad

	* [r37369] src/libged/wcodes.c:
	  need forward declaration as they call each other. mark them
	  HIDDEN and change names for consistency.

2010-01-21 18:05  brlcad

	* [r37368] src/libged/wcodes.c:
	  cleanup wcodes and increase the path limit from 12 (seriously,
	  wtf) to RT_MAXARGS (which is presently 9000). needs to be made
	  dynamic or handled in a different way (like building up the
	  result), but this should fix one of the issues reported by Kathy
	  Cook to the brlcad-users mailing list.

2010-01-21 15:53  irpguardian

	* [r37367] src/rt/view.c:
	  Added semaphore to timeTable_init to prevent multi-access to the
	  timetable before it's
	  made. Changed timeTable_init's parameter to be FBIO *fbp so that
	  way it may access the
	  framebuffer size directly, instead of relying on a global
	  variable. Program now 'works'
	  with multiprocessor support, most of the time, however output is
	  erroneous. Single processor
	  heat-graph is still unchanged.

2010-01-21 14:33  irpguardian

	* [r37366] src/rt/view.c:
	  Changed the method in which timetable is initialized, to prevent
	  re-intialization if a
	  picture changed the [0][0] pixel. Also changed heat-graph range
	  of values, to allow for
	  greater gradient. Quick pictures are now darker, and long
	  pictures now transition from dark
	  to light more.

2010-01-20 23:56  brlcad

	* [r37365] doc/docbook/system/man1/en/e_muves.xml:
	  e_muves not E_MUVES for the refname, also set a refentry id

2010-01-20 21:50  irpguardian

	* [r37361] src/rt/view.c:
	  Made the background better contrast to dark and light colors in
	  heat-map

	* [r37360] TODO:

	* [r37358] src/rt/view.c:
	  Heat-graph now has a set greyscale color distribution, where
	  light pixels took the longest
	  while dark pixels took the shortest. Still only works with 1
	  processor.

	* [r37357] regress/bots.sh:
	  mged spits out a 'Using Tcl Library...' message for certain build
	  configurations, so make sure we strip that out. another plug to
	  get better separation of stdout from stderr for MGED/LIBBU so
	  command results are written to stdout with info sent to stderr,
	  all via libbu logging mechanism

2010-01-20 16:30  irpguardian

	* [r37346] src/rt/view.c:
	  Basic Heat-Graph now works! ...with single processor only.
	  Currently uses only 3 different shades of colors to represent
	  time
	  taken to process image. Blue-short, Yellow-Medium, Red-Long.

2010-01-20 15:00  irpguardian

	* [r37339] src/rt/view.c:
	  Properly initialized timeTable with '-1' when first created. This
	  however causes
	  program to die when more than 1 processor works on it. (Adding
	  semaphores made program
	  hang).
	  Fixed pointers returned from timeTable_init to allow them to work
	  correctly.
	  Inverted test Image now renders with 1 processor, as opposed to
	  having a bus error.

2010-01-19 18:44  irpguardian

	* [r37308] src/rt/view.c:
	  Moved timeTable_input time funtions into timeTable_process
	  Made timeTable process not access a global variable inproperly.

2010-01-19 18:32  brlcad

	* [r37307] src/rt/view.c:
	  some notes about FIXME items including one HACKING code
	  convention failure (use of malloc()).

2010-01-19 18:26  brlcad

	* [r37306] src/rt/view.c:
	  ws, style, consistency cleanup and register keyword elimination

2010-01-19 18:16  irpguardian

	* [r37305] src/rt/view.c:
	  timetable_init now takes the Frame width & height, as opposed to
	  the current
	  pixel location.

2010-01-19 17:54  starseeker

	* [r37304] src/other/tkhtml3/Makefile.am:
	  Ah, right, gonna have to specify the .o files to clean up - take
	  a first stab.

2010-01-19 17:42  irpguardian

	* [r37303] src/rt/view.c:
	  Timetable is now dynamically sized via malloc, instead of hard
	  coded to have
	  size 4096. Also, max and min times are now properly initialized.

2010-01-19 17:27  starseeker

	* [r37302] src/other/tkhtml3/Makefile.am:
	  Oh yeah, bring doc along for the ride too.

2010-01-19 17:11  starseeker

	* [r37301] src/other/tkhtml3/Makefile.am:
	  Can't call out the headers in this fashion - they're in src or
	  not there yet. Let autotools do the distclean rule so it doesn't
	  complain, and add an EXTRA_DIST to grab src since so far src
	  isn't yet a proper subdir.

2010-01-19 17:01  irpguardian

	* [r37300] src/rt/view.c:
	  Added two more functions to view in relation to the heat-graph.
	  The first,
	  timetable_input is a reworked timetable_init that focuses only on
	  inputting
	  values into the timetable array. Timetable_init has been reworked
	  to only
	  initialize the timetable array. The second, is timetable_process,
	  which will
	  do the normalization and placing pixels into the file buffer.

	* [r37299] HACKING:
	  the rock linux package maintainer, stefan fiedler, is not
	  responsive with no valid point-of-contact. remove from release
	  notifications.

2010-01-19 16:21  starseeker

	* [r37298] src/other/tkhtml3/Makefile.am:
	  Tweak comments to refer to Makefile.am.

2010-01-19 16:08  brlcad

	* [r37297] NEWS:
	  ah, runtime toggling of display managers WAS already announced in
	  7.16.2; remove.

2010-01-19 15:39  starseeker

	* [r37296] src/other/tkhtml3/Makefile.am,
	  src/other/tkhtml3/aclocal.m4,
	  src/other/tkhtml3/tclconfig/README.txt,
	  src/other/tkhtml3/tclconfig/install-sh:
	  More tkhtml3 build tweaks - these work on OSX and Redhat, but
	  clearly more work to do

2010-01-19 06:50  brlcad

	* [r37294] HACKING:
	  change to the new dir

2010-01-19 05:14  starseeker

	* [r37292] NEWS, README:
	  whoops - set NEWS and README to the release to come.

	  misc/macosx/Resources/ReadMe.rtfd/TXT.rtf, src/archer/archer.bat,
	  src/mged/mged.bat, src/util/rtwizard.bat:
	  Bump version numbers to 7.16.5 - will be tagging off of STABLE,
	  so back to odd number on trunk.

2010-01-19 04:50  starseeker

	* [r37290] src/other/Makefile.am, src/other/tkhtml3/Makefile.am,
	  src/other/tkhtml3/Makefile.in, src/other/tkhtml3/acinclude.m4,
	  src/other/tkhtml3/aclocal.m4, src/other/tkhtml3/configure.ac,
	  src/other/tkhtml3/configure.in,
	  src/other/tkhtml3/tclconfig/install-sh:
	  tkhtml subconfigure test - it's unlikely this is correct, but
	  somewhat surprisingly it built and installed on a Gentoo Linux
	  box, so since we're past the 7.16.4 tag stick it in to give it a
	  try on a few other systems - maybe it can be polished up.
	  Constitutes a minimal set of changes to try to get the original
	  configure.in and Makefile.in files to act like configure.ac and
	  Makefile.am files, so they don't look much like other
	  configure.ac and Makefile.am setups in BRL-CAD.

2010-01-15 21:00  bob1961

	* [r37282] src/libged/bot_dump.c:
	  Remove undesired cp increment/advancement.

2010-01-15 20:08  bob1961

	* [r37281] src/libged/draw.c:
	  The previous typo fix was premature. We only need to check if the
	  returned cp is NULL.

2010-01-15 20:05  brlcad

	* [r37280] ChangeLog:
	  update Changelog in preparation for release 7.16.4

2010-01-15 19:48  brlcad

	* [r37279] src/libged/draw.c:
	  strrchr can return null, check for it.

2010-01-15 19:41  bob1961

	* [r37278] src/libged/draw.c:
	  Fixed a typo.

	* [r37276] BUGS:
	  and it was even documented.. by me. sunofabitch. shaders.sh is
	  now fixed, albeit by undoing the view initialization that broke
	  it. will have to see what else falls out.

2010-01-15 14:43  brlcad

	* [r37275] TODO:
	  push some items down, not clear they'll actually get addressed in
	  the next release. obj-g stalled, shelling ignored until marching
	  cubes is done, dbfind isn't pressing.

2010-01-15 13:48  brlcad

	* [r37274] doc/docbook/Makefile.am:
	  MAKEFILE_TEMPLATES is causing the .am files to get copied into
	  the build directory for some reason.. try extradist without
	  srcdir.

2010-01-15 04:04  brlcad

	* [r37273] src/libfb/fb_generic.c:
	  make sure the tk interface isn't the default
