	  heavily modify and restore the return and first arg of
	  bu_basename() to still return the buffer and take the constant
	  path. the gci change in r59475 introduced a non-minimally
	  impacting change that would have needed to go through deprecation
	  announcement. the restored sig (char*bu_basename(const char*,
	  char*)) will cause a warning but is compatible with the prior
	  (char*bu_basename(const char*)) and is minimally impacting with a
	  NULL buffer argument. the real benefit with the new form is that
	  some callers can pass a buffer (e.g., stack-allocated) instead of
	  requiring dynamic allocation, so some are updated to take
	  advantage of this.

	  Everything needing to use libgcv needs to also have its plugins
	  available. At the moment, the plugins depend on libgcv so this is
	  not guaranteed by the libgcv linkage specification. One thought
	  would be to make a 'libgcv_util' library that implements common
	  functionality for all the plugins, and then a thinner top level
	  libgcv that isn't directly used by the plugins. The latter can
	  then set up build dependencies on the plugins, ensuring that a
	  'make libgcv' produces a gcv system that is fully ready to run.

	* [r67791] CMakeLists.txt:
	  For now, take BUILD_TYPES specific assignments of CHECK_C_FLAG
	  and CHECK_CXX_FLAG results out of the picture. CMAKE_C_FLAGS
	  apparently gets picked up by the check_c_source_runs tests, but
	  the config specific vars do not. Rather than relying on
	  CMAKE_C_FLAGS, we should be using the documented
	  CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS variable to define our testing environment -
	  TODO. This also exposes a problem of how to store and use results
	  specific to debug/release environment definitions in a single
	  CMake configuration process, which is not well handled currently.
	  Possible solutions include build time selection of different
	  config.h files and forcing CMake to operate in
	  one-config-per-cmake-run mode regardless of whether the build
	  tool supports multiple configurations, but what the 'correct'
	  solution is isn't clear to me yet.

2016-03-18 18:06  starseeker

	* [r67376] src/libbu/file.c:
	  need second opinion on this, but it looks like two flaws in the
	  bu_file_delete pipeline. First one is in the check for the remove
	  return code - 0 is returned when the file is successfully
	  deleted, and -1 on error according to the man page. If the while
	  loop is looking for ret == 0 to continue trying to delete, ret
	  should be set to 1 after a successful remove in order to exit the
	  loop. The second issue appears to be in bu_file_exists - if fd is
	  passed in to be assigned, the return code is *always* successful
	  (1) even if open is in fact trying to open a file that does not
	  exist (fd ends up getting -1, but bu_file_exists returns 1 -
	  implying the file is there.) Instead, do the fd set if it is
	  requested and continue on to the actual 'does it exist on the
	  filesystem' test without returning 1 - that way fd is set
	  according to open *and* the return code correctly reflects
	  whether the file exists.

	  And the weird rolls on... XGetWindowAttributes, despite its name,
	  apparently updates some aspect of the window so that xwa's
	  width/height (and indeed the window refresh\!) are accurate. This
	  puts a Tk call in the configureWin_guts... if worst comes to
	  worst and there's not way to avoid this sort of thing, this
	  should at least be a function callback rather than hardcoded Tk.

	  potentially ambiguous case on Windows if a user has a g: drive
	  and wants to specify a .g file prefix to a path with
	  g:/path/to/file - did we mean a file on g: or a file on the
	  current drive with the .g type? Whatever we do end up with, it
	  should live separtely from bu_path_component - probably with the
	  mime handling logic.

	  trying to fix our own one-off on this, grab libnetpbm (NOT the
	  full netpbm distribution, just the core lib that does the
	  pbm/pgm/ppm/pam family of image formats) and use that. At the
	  moment it's just being used to replace the old ppm read/write
	  support in libicv, but should be fairly straightforward to get
	  all 4 formats working transparently. Needs build testing on

	  Use MathJAX for rendering equations (e.g.,

	  Move view_obj, the last remaining bit in obj.h, into bview.h.
	  This may not be technically minimally impacting, since the interp
	  type is changed from Tcl_Interp to void, but it also appears
	  view_obj was only ever used in libged/view_obj.c (the other obj.h
	  includes were removed without trouble.) All in all, my take is
	  this is close enough to 'non-published' and minimal enough to go

2015-12-03 20:36  starseeker

	* [r66733] src/libged/qray.c:
	  this apparently goes all the way back to 31394 - qray doesn't
	  actually operate on the database. Instead, it changes settings in
	  gedp. So it doesn't need to check if the database is open - in
	  fact, mgedrc typically has settings that set values for qray.
	  That's why we were seeing error messages in ged_result_str when
	  we had the problem with ged_glob not truncating down the result
	  string.

	  DISPLAY properly causing rt to pop up on a different window when

	  geometry conversion type guessing using this approach. Expands
	  the scope of bu_path_component a bit, but it already was able to

	  been part of Visual Studio since at least 2005 per
	  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2c8d19sb.aspx, so we can
	  fall back to the original strtok implementation. The strtok
	  version predates the use of strsep and was always present as a
	  fallback anyway if HAVE_STRSEP didn't work. Removing since this
	  is the only use of strsep in the BRL-CAD codebase.

	  per line and a label with a convention implied for each label
	  type (e.g., PLATE was n planar points that formed a closed loop
	  followed by a triple-repeated depth point). to be really useful,
	  this interface needed to be integrated during aquisition (e.g.,
	  with mged running on a tablet) so that error points could be
	  deleted (instead of having a delete/undo convention in the point
	  stream) and progress viewed interactively.

	  reporting them despite it being under /usr/include too.
	  conveniently, the sysctl interface is available without including
	  sysctl.h, so removing the header works; though will need to test

	  <2.9 (i.e., rhel5) with strict pedantic-errors c89 compilation.
	  while annoying that it's necessary, permitting header guards
	  (while not including common.h) does shorten many instances of

	  add initial support for datums as a first-class database object.
	  Datums are a non-solid geometric entities intended for storing
	  reference points, lines, planes, and combinations thereof (e.g.,
	  a coordinate reference frame consists of three orthogonally
	  intersecting planes, three axes at their intersections, and a
	  center point). The semantics used here closely follow ASME
	  standard Y14.5M and the various ISO standards regarding datums
	  (e.g., ISO 5459 and ISO 1101), but without support thus far for
	  other aspects like datum features (e.g., an actual manufactured
	  point/edge/surface) and feature control frames (annotation with
	  symbols, datum, and tolerance info). This is also a nearly
	  complete example for how to add a new entity to BRL-CAD,
	  including basic I/O support, some callbacks (e.g., plot), and
	  fundamental commands (in, make, keypoint, l, etc). Main bits
	  missing are a proper wdb/construction interface, GUI support, and
	  ray tracing (which aren't really applicable to datums).

	  - having the user handle the documentation piece of the optional
	  nature of an arg is worthwhile since it saves us both
	  implementation complexity in the description generator and (more
	  importantly) shortens the option description. The arg_process
	  functions are simply supplied with the entire remaining argv
	  array that hasn't been processed (with a little extra work to
	  handle equals sign-bearing options), which also avoids the need
	  to malloc, construct and free a duplicate argv.

	  base class specifies a SDAI_Application_instance (which is also
	  the dominant use), but a handful of class entity types like
	  SDAI_Select and a few other more specific types. This change
	  makes them all specify an app instance pointer with casts back to
	  their expected type accordingly (which is what the compiler was
	  doing anyways, hence the warnings). Ideally, they should actually
	  be using an app instance or the base class should be using a
	  different common type.

	* [r64339] src/libtclcad/tclcad_obj.c,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Fix the Archer command entry so saveview can be run with its full
	  range of arguments. By default saveview uses the name of the open
	  database in the script. This is a problem in Archer because the
	  open database is a working copy, which means it's deleted on
	  program exit, invalidating the script. Address this by silently
	  passing the name of the original database to saveview if the
	  input database isn't specified by the user. There's still a
	  problem in that if a user creates a saveview script based on the
	  working copy and doesn't save changes back to the original
	  database, then the saveview script may still be invalid. For now
	  though, possibly invalid is better than always invalid.

	  src/libtclcad/tclcad_obj.c, src/mged/dodraw.c, src/mged/dozoom.c,
	  src/mged/mged.c:
	  The "struct ged" contains a function pointer "void
	  (*ged_create_vlist_callback)(struct display_list *)" that is used
	  to create display list objects for solids in the "dl_headSolid"
	  list. 'mged' and 'archer' assign different functions to this
	  pointer but both eventually call "createDListAll()". The
	  "createDListAll()" as its name implies loops through all the
	  solids currently in the display lists' solid list 'dl_headSolid'.
	  I think due to some recent restructuring/consolidating this is
	  now being called from each leaf node in the tree walker(while
	  drawing) causing each successive solid to recreate the display
	  list for each solid currently in the list( n! effect). I've added
	  function pointer "void (*ged_create_vlist_solid_callback)(struct
	  solid *)" to "struct ged" that creates a display list for the
	  solid parameter and not all solids. I've assigned this function
	  pointer to "createDListSolid()" in 'mged' and to
	  "to_create_vlist_callback_solid()" in 'archer'. I modified
	  "dl_add_path()" and "invent_solid()" in 'libged' to use
	  "(*ged_create_vlist_solid_callback)" function pointer instead of
	  (*ged_create_vlist_callback)(). There are other uses of
	  (*ged_create_vlist_callback)() that look correct in that they
	  intend for all the display list to be (re)created so those were
	  left alone but I would like someone a bit more familiar to look
	  over.
	  
	  
	  Also (at least within an ogl 'mged' session) there are 5 displays
	  in the 'dm_list' which I believe are relating to the multipane
	  mode for which separate display list are created (so actually
	  currently have 5*n!). I now check for 'dlp->dml_mapped' to make
	  sure displays are mapped before creating display list object. I
	  hope that's consistent?

	  Good idea from Sean - set MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH so the graphviz
	  plots are more readable and more selectively relevant to the
	  function in question.

2015-02-03 01:54  starseeker

	* [r64122] misc/doxygen/Doxyfile.in:
	  Try excluding patterns *private* and *test* from Doxygen outputs.
	  Not ideal, since in theory comments on private functions would
	  still be handy for BRL-CAD devs, but on the theory that Doxygen
	  docs are primarily intended for external users of the APIs try
	  excluding for now.

	  Break up the task of convex hull calculation into calculating the
	  hulls of subsets of the input vertex array, and then calculating
	  hulls on the sets of hulls to build up to the final hull. While
	  the previous setup crashed on the Stanford dragon after around 9
	  hours running, this approach succeeded in about 30 seconds. It
	  doesn't address whatever the underlying issues are with the hull
	  implementation itself and large data sets, just pre-processes the
	  inputs to avoid dealing with them *as* a large data set. This
	  will not work in cases where large numbers of vertices are
	  legitimately part of the convex hull - in that case it actually
	  increases run times - and it's still not fast on large models
	  even when it helps, but since large bots of that nature already
	  aren't practical with this code and this does handle at least
	  some situations better go with it for now.

	* [r63703] src/libbn/chull3d.c:
	  Try to remove most of the fixed constants for mallocing - not
	  sure all of these are sensible defaults but nothing seems to
	  break. Also put the random shuffling back in, but at least in
	  initial testing it doesn't seem to help much. The Stanford dragon
	  model is too much for this code as it stands, so we'll need to
	  figure out how to fix it at some point. A gdb interruption after
	  a few minutes seems to indicate we're in chull3d_search a lot, so
	  perhaps there is something about that function or its callees
	  that doesn't scale well.

	  Need to swap in db_ls instead of the explicit looping in a few
	  places, but at least some of that code looks like it is
	  duplicated in mged and libged... needs more attention. Glob and

	* [r63509] src/libged/attr.c:
	  Needs more testing, but this gets most of the attr sub-commands

	  figured out show subcommand yet, but should have the rest in
	  there. Little fuzzy on the distinction between set and append,

2014-11-19 22:24  starseeker

	* [r63507] src/libged/attr.c:
	  This adds a 'list' option to attr that will accept a regular
	  expression pattern and report a consolidated list of all
	  attributes present on any of the objects matching the pattern in
	  the database. At the moment it will include hidden objects like
	  _GLOBAL - not sure what the default behavior should be here. attr
	  get will work on _GLOBAL without needing a flag to work with
	  hidden objects, but of course get (currently) accepts only a
	  single object.

	  procedural geometry objects have long been on my mind, but
	  recently rekindled with discussions at the gsoc reunion with
	  csaba on the state of the python interface to brl-cad geometry.
	  the basic idea is to have a geometry object whose definition is
	  not known until runtime, evaluated on-demand as needed per a set
	  of higher-level parameterizations defined for that object. these
	  are very much related to our proc-db C program notions, but
	  instead of having the procedure rigidly defined at compile-time,
	  it's defined by a runtime definition (e.g., tcl or python).
	  csaba's demonstrations were exceptionally compelling that
	  pybrlcad should be further developed as at least the first

	* [r63081] src/libged/brep.c, src/librt/primitives/brep/brep.cpp:
	  change the signature of rt_brep_boolean() to take a db_op_t
	  instead of a string for the boolean operation so the function
	  doesn't need to concern itself with parsing. this lets us
	  refactor the op string parsing to be consistent, using
	  db_str2op() instead. consequently eliminates xor from the brep
	  intersect command, which wasn't working anyways.

	  else lowered to the max, not raised to the max else lowered to
	  the min...

	* [r63018] include/bnetwork.h, include/bsocket.h:
	  sys/socket is both networking and non-networking, which is part
	  why it wasn't originally included but now with 'network' being
	  the nomenclature, it does embiggen inclusion. it's consequently
	  also why bsocket was named bselect, to avoid having headers with
	  overlapping api (select.h is socket agnostic, sys/socket.h is far
	  more general). go ahead an include in both for now to see how
	  things shake out but this probably either warrants combining them
	  or going back to the bselect distinction.

2014-09-24 20:49  brlcad

	  on windows, the internet networking and socket API are both
	  provided by Windows Sockets (i.e., winsock2.h). since this
	  header's scope is fd_set, select, and company, make sure we're

	  Somewhere in here (probably should be in do_event rather than the

	  recommendation from the fb implementation via a callback. The

	  Work towards completeing the 'ogl using openscenegraph' version
	  of the dm/fb work with OpenSceneGraph - not done yet, but looking
	  promising. This approach treats OpenSceneGraph as a portable
	  OpenGL context and uses the existing ogl dm and fb drawing code
	  (for the most part), rather than leveraging the actual scene
	  graph features of OSG (which is considerably more invasive.)
	  Adding this work for two reasons - 1) even though it is not a
	  major functionality boost, it does have the potential to collapse
	  the ogl and wgl dm/fb systems into a single, portable dm/fb and
	  2) it makes other efforts to actually use the scenegraph simplier
	  from a changeset management perspective. Controlled by the
	  BRLCAD_ENABLE_OSG flag, which is off by default.

	  62580, into trunk. This is the 'hide dm and fb' effort. In order
	  to make this work in trunk, we need to temporarily rework the
	  updates to still allow struct dm and struct fb to be part of the
	  public API so code explicitly accessing struct members can still
	  do so (that mechanism will go away after 7.26). Rather than
	  compliate this commit with those struct changes, they will be
	  done in a follow-on commit.

	  wow, old masked bug. rt_init_resource only conditionally
	  initializes various lists within the resource structure, so this
	  assumes that the entire structure starts out as zero. just
	  declaring the array does not zero-initialize, so we were getting
	  only partially initialized resources undoubtedly causing random

	* [r62512] src/libged/gqa.c:
	  this fixes the gqa resource bug. now bu_parallel() gives every

	  structure based on thread ID isn't the same or correct if

	  Modified several OpenNURBS surface routines
	  EvPoint(),Ev1Der(),Ev2Der() and EvNormal() to check for and
	  unwrap any u,v that extends outside of the surface domain. This
	  forces the u,v back into the surface domain ensuring correct
	  surface point/normal/derivative evaluations. This supports a
	  feature we added that allows trims to extend outside of the
	  domain and cross over closed seams. This feature can be
	  preprocessed in/out with the
	  "BRLCAD_FEATURE_EXTEND_UV_OVER_CLOSED_SEAMS" compile definition.
	  This definition is added to the openNURBS build by enabling the
	  flag "BRLCAD_ENABLE_OPENNURBS_EXTENSIONS". This flag is enabled

	* [r62499] src/libtclcad/tclcad_obj.c:
	  this fixes the adaptive wireframe in archer. to_is_viewable()
	  needs to look at the tcl result object, so it needs to overwrite
	  whatever was already there (and restore it just in case the
	  caller needed that result). this was messing with the display
	  drawing code where calls to to_is_viewable() would interfere
	  (causing the adaptive code to think it was drawing into a 1x1
	  display context).

	  reverse merge c62403 to restore jon's new eval logic that aims to
	  consolidate tcl evals through one routine (so we can capture all
	  output to the tcl console correctly). there is a problem in
	  archer with this version where wireframes appear horked. in fact,
	  they're not .. the adaptive wireframe code is simply being told
	  to render to a 1x1 display context, so it comes out looking quite
	  chunky. fix in following.

	* [r62321] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  initial in-depth tracking of thread state with execution limits

	  available), executing one child thread at a time until parent
	  cpus/cores become available. still tracing down the impl.

2014-08-20 13:56  brlcad

	* [r62285] src/libbu/semaphore.c:
	  reinit is no longer needed, minimally impacting to remove
	  (keeping explicit init for now)

	  src/rt/main.c, src/rt/rtwalk.c:
	  no longer need to manually initialize semaphores. they are
	  auto-initialized on first access and expanded as used.

	* [r62283] CHANGES:
	  no longer need to init semaphores

2014-08-20 13:44  brlcad

	* [r62282] include/bu/parallel.h, include/raytrace.h:
	  no longer need to call bu_semaphore_init()

2014-08-20 13:41  indianlarry

	* [r62281] src/conv/step/step-g/OpenNurbsInterfaces.cpp:
	  Added code to reparameterize face UV using surface 3d width and
	  height. Finding occasions when the face UV is parametrrized
	  narrow to the point of causing problems with the 2d pullback.
	  Also includes some debugging hacks that should be CPP'ed out.

2014-08-20 13:40  brlcad

	* [r62280] src/libbu/semaphore.c:
	  significantly rework the semaphore api to no longer require
	  explicit initialization. we use static data to avoid library
	  initialization statefulness and a common source of application
	  dev frustration (parallel apps forgetting a bu_semaphore_init()
	  resulted in obscure crashes and random behavior). also, avoiding
	  heap-allocated data makes memory management and cleanup more
	  simple. current semaphore limit is arbitrarily set at 1024 (two
	  orders higher than our current known uses).

	* [r62279] src/conv/step/STEPWrapper.cpp,
	  src/conv/step/STEPWrapper.h, src/conv/step/step-g/step-g.cpp:
	  Write out log file, instead of to std::out. Tweak formatting

2014-08-20 06:45  brlcad

	* [r62278] src/libbu/tests/bu_parallel.c:
	  narrowing in on a semaphore issue, looks to be related to thread
	  tracking in ThreadLocal and the semaphores it uses.

2014-08-20 03:57  brlcad

	* [r62276] src/libbu/tests/bu_parallel.c:
	  implement a couple more tests with considerably more collision
	  potential, make the counter per-cpu in order to avoid using
	  semaphores.

2014-08-20 03:24  brlcad

	* [r62275] src/libbu/tests/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/libbu/tests/bu_parallel.c:
	  add an initial simple set of unit tests for validating expected
	  bu_parallel behavior.

2014-08-20 03:00  brlcad

	* [r62274] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  oof, don't mix decls and code. have to replicate the arg check in
	  order to come after the var decls for both the parallel and
	  non-parallel ifdef sections.

2014-08-20 01:59  brlcad

	* [r62273] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  basic arg sanity, make sure the callback function is not NULL

2014-08-20 01:55  brlcad

	* [r62272] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  separate debug from logic

2014-08-20 01:51  brlcad

	* [r62271] include/bu/parallel.h:
	  update and expand the documentation for the venerable
	  bu_parallel() function with details on setting ncpu=0 and support
	  for recursive invocation. formally deprecate bu_is_parallel().

2014-08-20 00:31  starseeker

2014-08-19 20:59  brlcad

	* [r62266] src/librt/primitives/submodel/submodel.c:

2014-08-19 20:58  brlcad

	* [r62265] src/librt/db_tree.c:
	  check should have no effect as its still not yet possible to

2014-08-19 20:56  brlcad

	* [r62264] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  slight decrease in library statefulness affecting recursive

	  away as it no longer serves any use.

2014-08-19 20:47  brlcad

	* [r62256] src/conv/step/STEPWrapper.cpp:
	  Additinal validity checks on the reps from aCDSR before we try to

2014-08-19 18:43  brlcad

	* [r62250] src/libbu/tests/bu_semaphore.c:
	  fix the bu_semaphore unit test. the test was trying to ensure
	  that both threads actually made it into the parallel function,
	  but the first thread was getting through too fast before the
	  second thread could even test+set. it also wasn't setting
	  thread-safe so there was potential both would skip setting
	  parallel=1. now it spin loops the threads until a second process
	  can get there to set parallel=1.

	  will have to test if this is cross-platform-true, but asserting

2014-08-19 15:18  starseeker

	* [r62237] src/conv/step/STEPWrapper.cpp:
	  Re-enable the hierarchy-first approach. The difficulty was with
	  LocalUnits::length, which is used for scaling in the hierarchy
	  matrix build - the hierarchy logic was relying on the brep
	  loop(s) to set the length and assuming that the local length is
	  uniform for all objects. This behavior is restored and
	  hierarchy-first conversion now appears to be working, but we
	  should look into doing a units lookup on a per-object basis
	  during the hierarchy build so we can handle more complex
	  situtations.

2014-08-19 15:13  brlcad

	* [r62236] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  let ncpu=0 begin to mean something. intent is to mean 'use any

	  if there is no parent context (which this commit does) or
	  something more intelligent, keeping track of available slots as
	  threads complete.

	* [r62231] src/libbrep/PullbackCurve.cpp,
	  src/librt/primitives/brep/brep.cpp:
	  Added work around for case where OpenNURBS routines not returning
	  normals for valid points along a trim.

2014-08-19 13:21  brlcad

	* [r62230] src/libbn/poly.c:
	  remove the statefulness. the fpe handling isn't even consistently
	  used since it was only enabled for non-parallel app contexts, but
	  this also lets us eliminate all of the globals and stateful
	  bu_is_parallel() calls. if there are fpe issues, they should be
	  dealt with here via logic checks (check for division by zero,
	  etc).

2014-08-19 12:58  brlcad

2014-08-19 12:55  brlcad

	* [r62227] src/libbu/parallel.c:

2014-08-19 12:54  brlcad

	* [r62226] src/libbu/bomb.c:
	  remove the bu_kill_parallel() call. this is pretty much a
	  pointless no-op for our existing use cases, and the very next
	  step is abort().

2014-08-19 12:50  brlcad

	* [r62225] CHANGES:
	  bu_kill_parallel() doesn't kill the current process nor terminate
	  a current thread set like the name implies, so make it go away.
	  it basically only worked from a forked process.

	* [r61342] include/raytrace.h, include/rt/arb_edit.h,
	  src/librt/primitives/arb8/arb8.c:
	  Add and propagate const to eh edge/vertex mappings. If, as it

	  referenced then getting rid of them as globals becomes a lot
	  simpler...

2014-06-17 15:37  starseeker

	* [r61341] include/rt/arb_edit.h:

2014-06-17 15:30  starseeker

	* [r61340] include/rt/CMakeLists.txt, include/rt/arb_edit.h,
	  src/libged/edarb.c, src/librt/globals.c,
	  src/librt/primitives/arb8/arb8.c, src/mged/edarb.c:
	  Move the arb editing arrays out of globals.c into an rt
	  subheader. Both MGED and libged have versions of edarb.c, and we
	  need to consolidate that code down into librt so they have a
	  common place to look. arb_edit.h will be 'BRL-CAD internal' the
	  way we're planning for the libbu subdir headers to be internal.
	  I'm not really sure what this should look like as actual librt
	  API - probably some sort of functab that returns a list of
	  callable operations or some such - but in the meantime the
	  rt/subheader.h approach at least gets things out of global space
	  and allows us to move forward.

2014-06-17 10:45  indianlarry

	* [r61337] src/librt/primitives/bot/g_bot_include.c:
	  The rt_botface_w_normals_[double|float]() function is used as
	  part of rt_bot_prep and is used to check for degenerate BOT faces
	  and to fill in BOT normals. This function checks to make sure the
	  magnitude squared of the of triangle leg deltas (m1 =
	  MAGSQ(trip->tri_BA) && m2 = MAGSQ(trip->tri_CA)) are >=
	  tol->dist_sq. It also calculates a cross product using these same
	  leg deltas ( VCROSS(trip->tri_wn, trip->tri_BA, trip->tri_CA) )
	  to get the triangle normal direction. Also as part of its
	  degenerate face check it calculates the magnitude squared of this
	  normal (m4 = MAGSQ(trip->tri_wn)) and compares it to
	  tol->dist_sq. This causes a problem because when your triangle
	  leg deltas are near tol->dist the magnitude squared of the normal
	  is well below tol->dist_sq. I ran into this problem from an STL
	  conversion where the converter successfully created a BOT with
	  leg deltas near tol->dist but later when raytracing(or
	  calculating bounding box) called this function as part of the Bot
	  prep and tossed out the majority of faces. We still need to check
	  to make sure the triangle isn't degenerate by making sure the
	  triangle legs aren't parallel or coincident. To do this and keep
	  our tolerance checks in bounds I decided to use the dot product
	  of the triangle legs and check that against our parallel
	  tolerance. So now, (m4 = fabs(VDOT(trip->tri_BA, trip->tri_CA)))
	  and check it like (m4 >= tol->para). The raytrace and the
	  bounding box for these sub-millimeter facets looked much better.

	* [r61308] src/conv/step/step-g/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/conv/step/step-g/OpenNurbsInterfaces.cpp:
	  Added BREP loading for entity OrientedFace::LoadONBrep(ON_Brep
	  *brep) and also added to build system for step-g along with other
	  recently added
	  entities(GeometricallyBoundedSurfaceShapeRepresentation,ProductDefinitionWithAssociatedDocuments).

	* [r61301] src/conv/step/step-g/OpenNurbsInterfaces.cpp:
	  Fixed ConicalSurface::LoadONBrep(ON_Brep *brep) for case where
	  STEP cone height value incoming as zero.

2014-06-13 15:01  indianlarry

	* [r61300] src/conv/step/step-g/Line.h,
	  src/conv/step/step-g/OpenNurbsInterfaces.cpp:
	  Added SetParameterTrim(double start, double end) function for
	  line element to handle STEP inputs where line endpoints are
	  defined by parameter values. Somehow missed this(didn't encounter
	  in prior STEP imports) for lines, other curves already have this
	  function.

2014-06-13 14:47  indianlarry

	* [r61299] src/conv/step/step-g/OpenNurbsInterfaces.cpp:
	  Added our own version of ON_BrepFace::Reverse(int dir) which was
	  copied and slightly modified. OpenNURBS versions will make a
	  duplicate of the original surface only if the "surface use" count
	  > 1 otherwise it reverses the original surface. This led to
	  problems where "second use" needs to reverse but is unaware that
	  a "first use" has already reversed the original surface. This
	  version makes a duplicate of the original surface whenever it
	  need to reverse.

2014-06-12 18:45  vladbogo

	* [r61279] src/conv/step/STEPWrapper.cpp,
	  src/conv/step/STEPWrapper.h:
	  Added additional component name maps so converter checks to see
	  if name already used. If name already used extends the name with
	  an incrementing index until it finds an un-used name. Also added
	  call to Factory::DeleteObjects() to cleanup after each object
	  loaded and written to database.

2014-06-12 18:07  indianlarry

	* [r61277]
	  src/conv/step/step-g/ContextDependentShapeRepresentation.cpp:
	  Fixed for case where we don't have a complex type and just have a
	  single Shape_Representation_Relationship entity.

2014-06-12 17:27  indianlarry

	* [r61274] src/conv/step/step-g/ConnectedFaceSet.cpp:
	  Changed debugging CPP symbol to _DEBUG_TESTING_ and modified
	  debug code slightly to include static variable that I can modify
	  while debugging. Just a common place I come back to when
	  debugging.

2014-06-12 16:02  indianlarry

	  Mods for compiling on Windows.

2014-06-12 10:25  indianlarry

	* [r61261] src/librt/primitives/brep/brep.cpp:
	  When building trim polygon and encounter singularity we need to
	  bridge with a UV line. Added logic to make sure bridge is
	  connected in the right direction CW or CCW depending on the loop
	  and which side of the UV the singularity is on.

2014-06-12 10:18  indianlarry

	* [r61260] src/librt/primitives/brep/brep.cpp:
	  Updated logic for shifting loops that straddle a closed seam.

2014-06-12 10:09  indianlarry

	* [r61259] src/librt/primitives/brep/brep_debug.cpp:
	  Added new 'brep' sub-command 'UV' to draw 3d bounding box from
	  input UV intervals:
	  command - brep somebrep.s plot UV surface_index u1 u2 v1 v2
	  mged> brep brep.s1 plot 0 1 5 0 10
	  Can also be used to draw 3d iso of U or V by forcing one or the
	  other to same value:
	  V iso at v=5 - brep brep.s1 plot 0 0 6 5 5
	  Also added plot usage for 'UV' and missing 'Suv' sub-commands.

2014-06-12 09:44  indianlarry

	  src/librt/primitives/brep/brep.cpp, src/librt/test_bot2nurbs.cpp,
	  src/librt/tests/nurbs_tests.cpp:
	  Added additional tolerance to
	  surface_GetClosestPoint3dFirstOrder() and
	  trim_GetClosestPoint3dFirstOrder(), parameter "same_point_tol" is
	  used to stop the solver and return true when it gets to a
	  solution within this tolerance, parameter within_distance_tol" is
	  used to return true if the closest solution found is within this
	  tolerance (meaning we couldn't find anything closer but we will
	  settle for this). Also added a tolerance to
	  ConsecutivePointsCrossClosedSeam() which is the tolerance used
	  for the IsAtSeam() check. Added rendition of
	  surface_GetIntervalMinMaxDistance() which takes as input the
	  bounding box instead of the surface and interval to be used when
	  caching the bounding boxes. Added addition logic to resolve curve
	  loop ambiguities when point lies on a seam or singularity looking
	  at both previous and next points along loop.

	* [r61255] include/raytrace.h:

	  Made face_GetBoundingBox() & surface_GetBoundingBox() public;
	  added additional surface types to surface_GetBoundingBox() so
	  that surface gets cast to proper surface type. Added
	  face_GetBoundingBox() function that uses UV bounds of face for
	  tighter 3d bounds.

2014-06-11 12:24  indianlarry

	  src/librt/search.c, src/librt/search.h:
	  Add a -param option to search (needs more testing.) This will
	  allow searching based on internal parameters of an object (as
	  opposed to general attributes) provided those internal attributes
	  have a tcl list representation. It has so far successfully used
	  'mode' as a filter for listing volume and plate BoT primitives,
	  and a couple other parameters. Probably will need to add a table
	  listing the valid parameters available for the various primitives
	  to the search man page, since it's not immediately obvious what
	  the possibilities are.

	* [r61133] include/brep.h, src/libbrep/PullbackCurve.cpp:
	  Added additional IsAtSeam() functions that take a direction
	  parameter to check seam by direction.

	  src/libbrep/opennurbs_ext.cpp,
	  src/librt/primitives/brep/brep.cpp:
	  Created function surface_EvNormal() that wraps functionality of
	  OpenNURBS 'surf->EvNormal()'. OpenNURBS surface EvNormal() was
	  failing when at surface singularity but not on corner of domain.
	  If fails and at singularity this wrapper will now reevaluate at
	  domain corner.
	  Also made IsAtSingularity() public and added tolerance input
	  parameter. Also created rendition of IsAtSingularity() that takes
	  ON_2dPoint instead of u,v.

	* [r61106] src/librt/test_bot2nurbs.cpp:
	  Testing both pullback methods, it looks like they are mostly
	  consistent - this indicates the problem is at least partially
	  with the surface fit.

	  Surprisingly, once the new pullback routine is turned on by

	* [r61084] src/libbrep/CMakeLists.txt, src/librt/CMakeLists.txt:

	* [r61065] src/other/stepcode/src/clstepcore/instmgr.cc,
	  src/other/stepcode/src/clstepcore/instmgr.h:
	  The insertion mechanism for the sortedMaster array performed very
	  badly in the case where a large file has a batch of low-id-number
	  entities towards the end of the file. Tossing in std::map in
	  place of that array avoids the bad corner case, but we may pay a
	  performance penalty in other situations - depending on what the
	  bottle necks are, this may be work revisiting. For now, this
	  seems to work well enough.
