	  to strict compilation, it's a bsd extension). the 32-bit int
	  return value getting cast to a 64-bit pointer was badness.
	  instead rewrite the units parsing to use strtok() since it's c89,
	  also taking the opportunity to get rid of the unnecessary goto

	* [r37207] src/librt/roots.c:
	  okay, so the root solver is SUPER sensitive to these two changes.
	  one is an exact floating point comparison being made, the other
	  was a tolerance tightened up from a value set loose in the
	  mid-80's for irix2. this fixes the eto ray-tracing failures
	  caught by the solids.sh regression test. the SQRT_SMALL_FASTF

	  complete overhaul of the 'garbage_collect' command. rewrite the

	  users data if something unexpected happens. instead of copying
	  over the current database, use the working keep file as a testing
	  copy and just rename files around as they are processed and
	  verified. add more verification checks to make sure the view is
	  restored, objects are saved, and that processing failures won't
	  leave the user in an unrecoverable state. fixed a bug where the
	  title had a character getting nibbled off, also correctly handles
	  a db that is completely emptied out, also now restores the view
	  orientation. add help options and require the user actively
	  initiate the action with a -c|-confirm argument.

2010-01-07 07:41  brlcad

	* [r37166] src/libbu/parse.c:
	  erik pinpointed the routine, so looking through recent logs it's
	  clear that vls printing was damaged by automatic comma formatting
	  where a space was injected. undo the space injection (even though
	  struct parsing shouldn't be significant or so sensitive to a
	  whitespace change like that). this should hopefully fix some of
	  the volumetric objects (like ebm in solids.sh in regression
	  suite).

	* [r37119] include/bu.h, src/libbu/convert.c:
	  make bu_cv_cookie take a const char * not just because it's a

2010-01-02 22:26  brlcad

	* [r37116] include/magic.h:
	  get the pointer value as a long integer before doing the
	  comparisons. this will allow calls to BU_CKMAG for address of
	  structs on the stack to not produce a compilation warning about
	  the address always evaluating to true. going indirectly through
	  the value does make the magic check potentially a little more
	  expensive for non-optimized non-production builds.

	  awesome. with this commit, librt's C code is now free of all
	  verbose compilation warnings (on 32-bit osx). quellage includes

2010-01-02 18:53  brlcad

	* [r37108] src/librt/shoot.c:
	  modify the spatial position traversal to do what the comment
	  says, progressing the smallest amount possible. we progress by
	  SQRT_SMALL_FASTF (1e-39/1e-18) instead of the hardware tol
	  SMALL_FASTF (1e-77/1e-37) so as to be 'slightly' closer to what
	  we were stepping (1e-14). obviously needs testing..

2010-01-02 18:36  brlcad

	* [r37107] src/librt/roots.c:
	  odd exact floating point comparison here that dates back to 1986.
	  the intent looks like a simple comparison of b-diff == b being
	  that the diff is simply so near zero that it's below computation
	  tolerance to represent, which is SMALL_FASTF. additionally the
	  magic 1.0e-5 that was added for SGI is tightened up to
	  SQRT_SMALL_FASTF. obviously needs testing.

	* [r37105] src/librt/primitives/tgc/tgc.c,

	* [r37091] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_misc.c:
	  getting a handle on this one took some unexpected concentration.
	  reworked the logic slightly to avoid the goto jump that was being
	  used to restart the edge testing. it's actually simple enough to
	  let it fall through if we just make sure we let it keep track of
	  the edge table correctly (removing our edge before testing verts,

	  (it needed a non-const copy of it's edgeuse to pass to
	  nmg_radial_build_list() yet that list then becomes disassociated

2009-12-27 22:34  brlcad

	* [r37024] bench/run.sh:
	  less emphasis on the statement to submit results, instead call
	  attention to the email address. improve the output reporting of
	  sysctl (don't need vm) and the way results are formatted. include
	  prtdiag for solaris. use look_for to search the PATH to keep
	  failures quiet (and avoid having to run the binary additional
	  times)

2009-12-27 19:36  brlcad

	* [r37023] bench/run.sh:
	  emphasize submitting results, include an approx VGR result on a

2009-12-27 19:05  brlcad

	* [r37021] bench/run.sh:
	  restructure the output so that system configuration information
	  is included at the end of the log instead of the beginning. that
	  also lets us preserve the sysctl formatting and include the
	  verbose /proc/cpuinfo details if they are available. we do this
	  quietly only because it's so much output, but still let the user
	  know that additional information was added to the log.

2009-12-27 18:36  brlcad

	* [r37020] NEWS:
	  the benchmark suite now includes sysctl hardware information in
	  the log output. I was manually asking everyone for this
	  information anyways, so it's good to just have it automatically
	  included in the log. still would be nice to get a copy of
	  /proc/cpuinfo if it's a linux system, though.

2009-12-27 18:34  brlcad

	* [r37019] bench/run.sh:
	  include sysctl hardware information in the output log after
	  uname, collapsing all lines into just one. also add additional
	  tests to make sure the scripts and binaries we're about to use
	  actually work before putting them to use.

	  Update to version 200909255 - opennurbs V5 first release. Have
	  attempted to merge in all related fixes from previous BRL-CAD
	  openNURBS version, but this merge deliberately removes special
	  purpose code used in earlier attemps at NURBS raytracing. Some of
	  this code is still used and will reappear in opennurbs_ext.cpp
	  and opennurbs_ext.h - ideally all changes now present in
	  src/other/openNURBS will be related to compiler specific issues,
	  using external zlib, or genuine logical changes (not simply
	  additions) to openNURBS. (An example of the latter is the xtol
	  and ytol changes in opennurbs_brep.cpp)

	  quell the warnings from make about overriding commands for

	  rename the BOOL and BOOLS classes to BOOLEAN and BOOLEANS
	  respectively so as not to conflict with openNURBS (and other
	  codes that commonly use BOOL as a simple boolean type). this also
	  conveniently makes the class name lengths match the corresponding
	  LOGICAL and LOGICALS classes. unsure about the Bool->Boolean

	  those need to be unrolled for the actual step parsing.

2009-12-22 14:20  brlcad

	* [r36976] src/libged/nirt.c:
	  there probably be little dragons here. replace the strip_crlf()
	  win32-specific hack with a more generalized solution that just
	  trims space on the line parsed in. it's not clear why they even
	  matter with bu_fgets() reading in lines portably other than it
	  printing \n\r's into the result string (which then also just begs
	  for space trimming). untested.

2009-12-22 13:57  brlcad

	  Wrapped debug variable declaration with DEBUG definition. Removed
	  bu_cmdtab struct array 'ch_cmds[]' and 'cho_hist()', look to be

	  remove the 'experimental' binary object type. this was never
	  implemented beyond a few stubs and has a horrible vague name, so
	  kill it. we have to leave the ID and functab entry stubbed so
	  that indices offset correctly but mark it as unused so some

	  remove minor_type from the functab interface for import5/export5.
	  this was apparently only added for binary objects, which needs to
	  know which minor type they are during import. instead of the
	  object writing out it's minor type during export, it munged the
	  api to have the minor type passed from the raw_external instead.
	  this moves towards undoing that by removing minor_type from all
	  other objects and making binunif's a special case in db5_io. once
	  functab is properly encapsulated, this can be revisited to make
	  binunifs aware of their minor type without needing to modify the
	  v5 db format.

2009-12-22 03:46  brlcad

	* [r36966] TODO:
	  binary objects need to write out their minor type during export

	  bitvs and ptbls except didn't make the necessary bookkeeping mods

	* [r36936] src/other/tkpng/Makefile.in:
	  As long as libtool isn't being invoked, restore Makefile.in to

	  configure.in

2009-12-18 01:06  starseeker

	* [r36935] configure.ac, src/other/Makefile.am:
	  Sigh. This probably violates some rule or other, but since we're
	  passing in our own custom TKPNGZLIB variable anyway have it point
	  to the .so link instead of the .la file and take libtool out of
	  the equation. Also add LIBM to the flags we need to feed the
	  tkpng make process.

	  require use. Archer appears to be the only app using it at the
	  moment, so remove tkimg loading code and package require tkpng
	  instead. As of this checking tkpng won't build out of box in all

	  that seems to work right. this should let Tk be optional at least

	  oof. this can have some widespread repercussions.. VEQUAL was
	  using exactness testing, relying on stable representation
	  comparisons (leaving a false sense of behavior by callers).
	  SMALL_FASTF is what we define as the minimum representation
	  capacity delta of the hardware, so we use that now instead. this
	  will change behavior and require additional testing, but is what
	  the vmath routine needs to be. the callers (which at a glance are
	  patch-g, shading/lighting, and tessellation/facetization) may
	  need to be adjusted to accommodate but a cursory review of their
	  calls looked okay with the added fuzz. actually hoping this will
	  help stabilize some of the more obscure unreliable tessellation
	  failures.

	  make the gcv_region_end callback take a dummy struct for passing

	  well there's yer problem. the complex math routines used during

	* [r36562] src/libbn/mat.c:
	  fix the remaining tolerance failure (star regression) by

	  slew of additional warnings getting seeded out by different
	  compilers. these are mostly all related to assert() and
	  unreachable code (due to a bug in the implementation of libc's
	  assert()), resorting to BU_ASSERT where feasible. there were a
	  few goto sections that needed rewiring too.

	* [r36547] configure.ac, src/other/step/configure.ac:
	  reverse the strict-build variable to be consistent with the
	  others, remove AC_C_PROTOTYPES (we assume c89 compliance as a
	  minimum)

2009-11-18 23:01  starseeker

	* [r36546] include/bu.h:
	  Don't want to totally undef __attributes__ - causes problems with
	  the vector_x86.h and probably vector_fpu.h files.

2009-11-18 22:50  brlcad

2009-11-18 21:15  brlcad

	* [r36543] AUTHORS, NEWS:
	  credit Emton (irc) aka icmbml (sf) with special thanks for his
	  1-liner patch to tabinterp. should fix a rate interpolation bug
	  where interpolation was at fixed (incorrectly large) increments.

2009-11-18 21:01  bob1961

	* [r36542] src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Added a public putString method.

2009-11-18 20:20  brlcad

	  restructure so forward declarations are not needed

2009-11-18 20:10  starseeker

	* [r36538] configure.ac, include/bu.h:
	  Add an configure based flag for the format hitting toggle - this
	  should be more robust for turning on/off format checking.

2009-11-18 19:55  starseeker

	* [r36537] src/libbu/parse.c:
	  Blast it, sucked in change by mistake.

2009-11-18 19:53  starseeker

	* [r36536] configure.ac, src/libbu/parse.c:
	  Add a configure option to disable strict compiler flags at need
	  (-disable-strict) - they're enabled by default but this provides
	  a convenient way to turn them off.

2009-11-18 19:50  brlcad

	* [r36535] src/tab/tabinterp.c:
	  ws indent style formatting cleanup

2009-11-18 19:46  brlcad

	* [r36534] src/tab/tabinterp.c:
	  apply imcbml/Emton's sf patch 2899596 (TABINTERP RATE INTERP)
	  where the rate interpolation function was taking the (fixed)
	  times table value instead of directly using the simple
	  interpolation t value. this should hopefully fix a tabinterp bug
	  with rate-based table interpolation, but untested.

	* [r36533] src/conv/step/OpenNurbsInterfaces.cpp:
	  cleaned up original ellipse function stubs and some reordering

2009-11-18 19:17  brlcad

	* [r36532] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  quell warning, print the pointer as a pointer instead of a size_t

2009-11-18 19:16  bob1961

	* [r36531] src/libged/nirt.c:
	  Mods to accommodate an earlier change to the nirt application
	  (.i.e. the application is no longer setting the file modes to
	  O_BINARY). Here we, likewise, no longer set the file modes to
	  O_BINARY and strip of any CRLF's we find.

2009-11-18 19:00  indianlarry

	* [r36530] src/conv/step/OpenNurbsInterfaces.cpp:
	  Cleaned up ellipse code to directly build ellipse from
	  bezier(similar to the
	  hyperbola) versus using openNURBS ellipse routine allowing for
	  better control
	  of the curve parameterization. Also removed unit conversion of
	  curve endpoints
	  for trimmed curves now done in one place the trimmed_curve
	  parent.

	* [r36529] src/libbn/plane.c, src/libbn/sphmap.c,

	  revert for now.

2009-11-18 18:12  starseeker

	* [r36527] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  Sigh. Put parallel.c back as well - casting is size_t, which
	  appears to complicate things.

2009-11-18 17:12  indianlarry

	* [r36526] src/conv/step/TrimmedCurve.cpp:
	  Added unit converions to Trim_Curve entity when trimming by
	  cartesian_point.

2009-11-18 15:52  starseeker

	* [r36525] src/libbu/parse.c:
	  Put the %V back for now - apparently there's some sort of custom

2009-11-18 15:04  erikgreenwald

	* [r36524] src/libbu/backtrace.c, src/libbu/fchmod.c:
	  wrap the extern fileno to avoid explosions where fileno is

	* [r36523] src/libbn/plane.c, src/libbn/sphmap.c,
	  src/libbn/tabdata.c:
	  Take a stab at libbn warnings for llvm-gcc - not sure what
	  wavelet.c is doing when generating code but that's producing a
	  lot of 'format ‘%d’ expects type ‘int’, but argument...' type
	  stuff

	  src/libbu/kill.c, src/libbu/mappedfile.c, src/libbu/temp.c,
	  src/libbu/units.c:
	  quell a slew of additional warnings for strict mode compilation.
	  we still use non-c99 functions, but have to declare them
	  ourselves if it's a strict compliance compile (configure takes
	  care of when they're not available at all for some symbols).
	  re-enable STRICT_FLAGS.

2009-11-18 00:48  brlcad

	* [r36518] src/libbu/parse.c:
	  another isascii()

2009-11-18 00:47  brlcad

	* [r36517] src/libbu/parse.c:
	  there's no point in limiting parsing to chars < 127, testing if

	* [r36516] src/libbu/malloc.c:
	  in more than 15 years, i've not derived any useful value knowing

	* [r36515] src/libbu/backtrace.c, src/libbu/brlcad_path.c,
	  src/libbu/crashreport.c:
	  quell a variety of compliance warnings. popen, kill, and fileno
	  are annoyingly not in c99.

2009-11-17 23:59  brlcad

	* [r36514] src/libbn/fortran.c:
	  remove the ifdopn/IFDOPN fortran wrapper as it uses fdopen()
	  which supposedly isn't in c99 (yet is c89). old unpublished
	  interface, see if anyone is affected.

2009-11-17 23:50  brlcad

	* [r36513] src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_memory.c:

	  src/libbn/multipoly.c, src/libbn/poly.c, src/libbn/tcl.c,
	  src/libbn/wavelet.c:

	  strict with respect to compilation warnings too

	* [r36511] src/mged/doevent.c, src/mged/mged_dm.h:

	* [r36510] src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_font.cpp:
	  oops, meant to apply this to trunk.. workaround patch for a gcc
	  4.0.1 optimization bug where it ends up outputting bad assembly
	  causing a relocation linker failure. (local recloation for
	  address 0x00... in section __text does not target section
	  __const) this avoids getting a const wchar_t* directly from a
	  wide string literal, instead going through the ON_wString class.

	  doc/docbook/books/en/BRL-CAD_Tutorial_Series-VolumeIII.xml,
	  doc/docbook/fop.xconf.in:
	  At long last, what appears to be a solution to the png image in
	  pdf file problem when using fop. Generate a config file that sets
	  the base path and add it to the fop call. Requires ALL xml files
	  to use the ../../pathname convention, but since xinclude required
	  that anyway what the heck. Start with key files, will follow with
	  massive image moving.

	* [r36502] src/libbu/mappedfile.c:
	  mmap takes void*, feed it NULL

2009-11-16 17:44  brlcad

	* [r36501] TODO:
	  technically now have stricter compilation flags on 'clean'
	  directories .. just only one dir (libbu) is clean, and semi-clean
	  at that (can't enable -std=c89 justwithout quellage)

2009-11-16 17:32  brlcad

	* [r36500] configure.ac:
	  minor comment

2009-11-16 17:27  brlcad

	* [r36499] configure.ac:
	  keep disabled, but need to move the c89 test above above the
	  headers and types so the tests will fail properly (ran into
	  HAVE_SIG_T getting defined even though it's a bsd extension,
	  compile-time failure.)

2009-11-16 17:14  brlcad

	* [r36498] src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	  quell warning. cast since the func returns int (thx Emton) and
	  PKC_ERROR is already a cast pointer.

2009-11-16 17:13  brlcad

	* [r36497] configure.ac:
	  strict c89 standards compliance without gnu or bsd extensions is
	  a bit too far out of reach .. disable for the time being.

2009-11-16 16:56  starseeker

	* [r36496] doc/deprecation.txt:
	  Fix typo in instructions.

2009-11-16 16:51  starseeker

	* [r36495] doc/deprecation.txt:
	  make_bb will go away in favor of bb, which defines a superset of
	  its functionality.

2009-11-16 16:31  starseeker

	* [r36494] src/other/step/Makefile.am:
	  Bad developer. Update the Makefile.am too.

2009-11-16 16:29  starseeker

	* [r36493] src/other/step/TODO:
	  Add a TODO about getting the NIST code to actually generated the
	  correct code for src/conv/step

2009-11-16 16:27  brlcad

	* [r36492] src/other/jove/jove_io.c:
	  minor ansi compliance patch, use S_ISCHR() instead testing
	  S_IFCHR directly.

2009-11-16 15:47  brlcad

	* [r36491] configure.ac:
	  override setting all flags for -std=c89 since we only want
	  CFLAGS, not CXXFLAGS. not a valid std on c++ files.

2009-11-16 15:16  erikgreenwald

	* [r36490] src/libged/bb.c, src/libged/search.c,
	  src/librt/primitives/bot/bot.c,

	* [r36489] src/libbu/avs.c, src/libbu/list.c, src/libbu/parallel.c,
	  src/libbu/vls.c:
	  quell a variety of verbose-level warnings, primarily type
	  conversions

2009-11-16 13:50  brlcad

	* [r36488] configure.ac:
	  add compiler tests for strict compilation flags (-pedantic -W
	  -Wall -Werror) along with -Wno-lang-lang which is needed due to
	  tcl.h's use of the c99 long long construct. this set of strict
	  compilation flags can be enabled on a per directory basis using
	  the STRICT_FLAGS variable as directories are cleaned up.
	  additionally, add -std=c89 to the compile line to make our
	  compliance goal explicit (at least if we're using gcc).

2009-11-16 13:47  brlcad

	* [r36487] include/bu.h:
	  if we're compiling stricct, turn attributes off. this is needed
	  because our format string allows a %V conversion character that
	  is not recognized.

2009-11-16 13:08  brlcad

	* [r36486] src/other/step/configure.ac:
	  more removal for brevity

2009-11-16 12:50  brlcad

	* [r36485] src/other/step/configure.ac:
	  remove loads of unnecessary stuff. should reduce configure time
	  some.

2009-11-16 11:54  brlcad

	* [r36484] src/libdm/Makefile.am, src/libdm/TODO:

2009-11-13 20:51  bob1961

	* [r36483] src/libtclcad/ged_obj.c:

2009-11-13 18:13  bob1961

	* [r36482] src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:

2009-11-13 17:30  bob1961

	* [r36476] src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Component pick now prints a string to the command window instead
	  of popping up another window.

2009-11-13 17:28  bob1961

	* [r36475] src/tclscripts/archer/AttrGroupsDisplayUtility.tcl:
	  Mark the selected item using a grey background.

2009-11-10 23:57  brlcad

	* [r36469] HACKING:
	  sf.net FRS changed slightly. path is different as our whole file
	  release hierarchy is now traversable. should reorganize sometime
	  soon to take advantage of this change.. until then, say what it
	  is now.

2009-11-10 23:41  brlcad

	* [r36468] src/mged/cad_boundp.c, src/mged/cad_parea.c,
	  src/mged/mged.c:
	  few more bu_optind init-to-zeros just for sanity sake (as they're
	  the first calls in their respective main() funcs)

2009-11-10 23:37  brlcad

	* [r36467] src/libged/human.c:
	  looks like human has the same problem as kill, need to init
	  bu_getopt()

2009-11-10 22:12  brlcad

	* [r36464] src/libged/keep.c:
	  BAH! .. bu_optind has to be manually reset before bu_getopt(),
	  otherwise we'll get whatever previous bu_optind there was. this
	  should fix the problem victor noticed in sf bug 2890876 ( Keep
	  command in mged is creating a file named keep ).

2009-11-10 20:48  indianlarry

	* [r36463] src/conv/step/OpenNurbsInterfaces.cpp:
	  use 3d curve bounding boxes to ensure linear extrusion sized
	  properly, also checks that both the origin and face bounding box
	  are used to determine extents of cylindrical surface

2009-11-10 20:31  indianlarry

	* [r36462] src/librt/primitives/brep/brep_debug.cpp:
	  additional face details added to "brep brep.s info F 0" command

2009-11-10 15:17  brlcad

	* [r36461] HACKING:
	  clean up stable sync instructions since it's always safe to grab
	  CURR, and might as well export PREV so the rest can be
	  copy-pasted without change.

2009-11-10 15:16  brlcad

	* [r36460] bench/run.sh:
	  let the user know about 'benckmark clean' to remove the plethora
	  of pix files that get generated. make clean mention clobber to
	  remove the log files.

2009-11-10 14:59  brlcad

	* [r36459] bench/run.sh:
	  if any of the benchmark tests fail, blather loudly that the
	  testing failed with instructions to the user. this should cause
	  the benchmark to halt compilation testing (via make check or make
	  bench) and avoids writing out 0 values into the summary file.

2009-11-10 14:05  brlcad

	* [r36458] NEWS, README, include/conf/PATCH, src/archer/archer.bat,
	  src/mged/mged.bat, src/util/rtwizard.bat:
	  bump to 7.16.3 in anticipation of 7.16.4 being the next release
	  iteration.

2009-11-10 13:54  brlcad

	* [r36456] src/archer/archer.bat, src/mged/mged.bat,
	  src/util/rtwizard.bat:
	  the batch file numbers didn't get bumped, bump to 7.16.2 for
	  release

2009-11-10 12:35  indianlarry

	* [r36455] src/conv/step/PullbackCurve.cpp:
	  Added checks around curve sampling counts when trying to resolve

	  Also cleaned up some debug code.

2009-11-10 12:32  indianlarry

	  surfacs.

2009-11-10 12:02  indianlarry

	* [r36453] src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	  Fixed bug where 'min_dist' wasn't being set in
	  SurfaceTree::getSurfacePoint()

2009-11-07 04:18  brlcad

	* [r36451] NEWS, TODO, src/util/Makefile.am, src/util/pix-ppm.1:
	  added a man page for the pix-ppm command

2009-11-06 23:35  brlcad

	* [r36450] sh/cmakecheck.sh:
	  update the script to not really care where/how a file is
	  referenced for cmake since the SOURCES thing it keys on for our
	  libraries is just a convention. assume if a source file is
	  referenced, that it's good enough to consider it in sync. this
	  lets us add in the intaval, iges, and nirt directories to the
	  list.

2009-11-06 23:33  brlcad

	* [r36449] src/nirt/CMakeLists.txt:
	  create the showshot binary just so the cmake file is in sync with
	  the Makefile.am

2009-11-06 22:43  brlcad

	* [r36448] NEWS:
	  per confusion by a particular user, improved the pix-ppm tool
	  (and pix-png as collatoral damage) by adding a -o output option
	  so you don't have to redirect stdout if you don't want to. even
	  better, you can redirect AND use -o output.

2009-11-06 22:39  brlcad

	* [r36447] src/util/pix-ppm.c:
	  enable the -o output option and also allow redirected output per
	  pix-png

2009-11-06 22:06  brlcad

	* [r36446] src/util/pix-ppm.c:
	  cleanup defines no longer used

2009-11-06 22:00  brlcad

	* [r36445] src/util/pix-ppm.c:
	  refactor the ppm output into a single write function and fix the
	  header always going to stdout instead of the specified output.

2009-11-06 21:47  brlcad

	* [r36444] src/util/pix-png.c, src/util/pix-ppm.c:
	  no need for usage to be static

2009-11-06 21:43  brlcad

	* [r36443] src/util/pix-ppm.c:
	  eliminate two globals for width/height

2009-11-06 21:43  starseeker

	* [r36442] ChangeLog, NEWS, include/conf/PATCH:
	  OK, here we go - update version numbers, ChangeLog

2009-11-06 21:27  bob1961

	* [r36441] include/opennurbs_ext.h:
	  Sean changed size_t to int in a few places to iterate over BA
	  node min/max indices. Also includes a WS update

2009-11-06 20:34  brlcad

	* [r36440] src/util/pix-ppm.c:
	  make pix-ppm work a lot like pix-png, stubbing in support for a
	  -o option and adding additional tty protections for input/output
	  checking.

2009-11-06 20:31  brlcad

	* [r36439] src/util/pix-png.c:
	  match case ordering

2009-11-06 20:29  brlcad

	* [r36438] src/util/pix-png.1, src/util/pix-png.c:
	  refactor so that you can actually send image data out to both a
	  file and a specified redirect, in case some crazy user actually
	  tries it.

2009-11-06 20:05  brlcad

	* [r36437] src/util/pix-ppm.c:
	  make sure pix-ppm doesn't blather raw ppm data directly to a
	  terminal..

2009-11-06 20:04  brlcad

	* [r36436] src/util/pix-png.1, src/util/pix-png.c:
	  improve pix-png output and add a '-o filename' option so that a
	  file redirect is not required

2009-11-06 19:59  bob1961

	* [r36435] src/libtclcad/ged_obj.c:
	  Tweak the png command a bit.

2009-11-06 19:58  bob1961

	* [r36434] src/libged/dg_obj.c, src/libged/draw.c:
	  Fixed a bug that potentially tries to use a bu_list as a solid
	  (i.e. when the list is empty).

2009-11-06 19:55  bob1961

	* [r36433] src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/lib/Ged.tcl:
	  Added code to reduce the number of unnecessary redraws in Archer.
	  More to follow.

2009-11-06 19:51  bob1961

	* [r36432] misc/win32-msvc8/tclsh/library/installTree.tcl:
	  Added lines for attrGroupsDisplayUtilityP. No longer copying
	  entire doc directory to install directory (i.e. it breaks nsis)

2009-11-06 19:48  bob1961

	* [r36431] src/archer/archer:
	  Modify where to look for archer.ico.

2009-11-06 19:43  brlcad

	* [r36430] include/config_win.h, include/dm_xvars.h:
	  tk for windows provides the X11 types that are part of the tk
	  api. unbreak the windows build and improve the typedeffage we
	  don't typedef if we already have them.

2009-11-06 17:45  brlcad

	* [r36429] src/util/pix-ppm.c:
	  cleanup formatting but more importantly improve the usage
	  statement to indicate that output is on stdout

2009-11-06 15:20  erikgreenwald

	* [r36428] src/librt/primitives/metaball/metaball.c:
	  add/use a function two search for the surface intersection
	  between two points.

2009-11-06 13:17  bob1961

	* [r36427] misc/win32-msvc8/libged/libged.vcproj,
	  misc/win32-msvc8/librt/librt.vcproj,
	  misc/win32-msvc8/libtclcad/libtclcad.vcproj:
	  Update windows build to accomodate adding/deleting source files
	  from build.

2009-11-06 03:49  brlcad

	* [r36426] NEWS:
	  incomplete for plate-style non-solid bspline/nurbs geometries,
	  but I made old bspline/nurbs use the new/improved opennurbs
	  ray-tracing.
