	  1982 (sometime before March 1983) before the code was under

	  so he was BRL-only.

	* [r30857] src/proc-db/tire.c:
	  Major change in the way ellipses are used to model sides. Instead
	  of 1 rotated ellipse per side, use two non-rotated ellipses for
	  the top of the sides and a single ellipse to take care of the
	  bottom half of both sides. Mathematical solver code is unchanged
	  since it is quite general, but additional ellipses are being
	  solved for and inputs should constrain them to be non-rotated.
	  This method should have the potential to guarantee a specific
	  tire width and may (with some more work) be more flexible for
	  unusual tire sizes.

2008-05-05 22:27  brlcad

	* [r30998] src/other/tcl/generic/regex.h:
	  revert 30995 as regfree does need to be defined to TclReFree else
	  unresolved symbols on other platforms. the problem (presumably on
	  windows) is probably the build finding the
	  src/other/libregex/regex.h header before tcl's from
	  src/other/tcl/generic/regex.h; the include paths should include
	  tcl first in order for tcl to compile its regex interface.

2008-05-06 12:07  bob1961

	  gah, remove the incorrect copying.txt file that refers to the
	  gpl. make the nsis build file refer to the top-level COPYING and
	  README instead of the incorrect copying.txt and outdated html
	  manual page

2008-05-06 23:30  brlcad

	* [r31010] NEWS:
	  Bob fixed a long-standing bug reported by Tom Browder where
	  rt/rtedge were incorrectly clipping the render due to an invalid
	  eye point calculation. The problem was traced down to code
	  commited all the way back in 1997 where the longest dimension of
	  the bounding box was used as the default eye point backout
	  distance. This in turn could cause clipping if the diagonal
	  distance was considerablly larger and when rendering from a
	  non-orthogonal view. it does not seem to be intentional and only
	  occurred when rt/rtedge was invoked from within mged (where the
	  dgo interface gets called). this fixes sf bug 1525332 (Rt (and
	  Rtedge) Clips Image).

2008-05-07 00:14  brlcad

	* [r31011] NEWS, doc/html/manuals/mged/mged_cmd_index.html,

	  src/tclscripts/mged/help.tcl, src/tclscripts/mged/make_solid.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/mged/openw.tcl:
	  this renames the wdb_binary / dbbinary mged command to just
	  'binary' .. this seems to be what it is actually used in archer
	  already, what makes more sense, and is more consistent with other
	  commands. happened to fix a mistake in the html docs in the
	  process. also updated the command's help so that it's less brain
	  dead wrong in response to tom browder's sf bug 1532699 (dbbinary
	  -o help is misleading)

2008-05-07 01:44  brlcad

	* [r31012] configure.ac:

2008-05-07 18:19  starseeker

	* [r31014] src/nirt/command.c, src/nirt/nirt.1:
	  Change behavior of backout command in interactive nirt - backout
	  flag can now be activated and deactivated, and repeated
	  invocations of backout will not increase the backout distance
	  with each invocation. Also, change of origin due to backout use
	  in shoot is now temporary - previous value is restored after shot
	  is complete.

2008-05-07 18:23  starseeker

	* [r31015] NEWS:
	  Add NEWS note for nirt change

2008-05-08 09:23  brlcad

	* [r31016] NEWS:
	  reword the nirt backout line just so that we can make the commit
	  log more substantial. commit messages for NEWS lines need to be
	  detailed as they're used during configuration reviews. To quote
	  Cliff's original log message for this feature: Change behavior of
	  backout command in interactive nirt - backout flag can now be
	  activated and deactivated, and repeated invocations of backout
	  will not increase the backout distance with each invocation.
	  Also, change of origin due to backout use in shoot is now

	  Add make files for new doc directories

2008-05-10 16:18  brlcad

	* [r31048] configure.ac:
	  REGEX_CPPFLAGS MUST COME AFTER TCL INCLUDE PATHS .. else you can
	  end up with unresolved regex symbols due to tcl's double #define
	  redirection of regex calls from their regex.h header. Symptom of
	  this problem is unresolved TclReFree symbols during linking of
	  libs that use tcl and/or unresolved regcomp, regerror, and
	  regexec symbols in libraries that don't use tcl.

2008-05-10 18:03  brlcad

	* [r31049] configure.ac, src/librt/Makefile.am,
	  src/librt/regionfix.c:
	  yet another change to help with the TclReFree linkage errors.
	  more details is that tcl doesn't need/want regex headers but all
	  callers do need it (and need it before tcl's to find our regex
	  headers), so the regex flags shouldn't be added to the
	  tcl_cppflags at all really.

2008-05-10 18:09  brlcad

	* [r31050] src/libsysv/Makefile.am:
	  oops, forgot to commit this one, another regex caller.

	  src/tab/tabsub.c:
	  rewrite and modify bu_argv_from_string to make it more consistent
	  with other functions. the limit now corresponds to the number of
	  non-NULL words being put into the argv array, not the size of the
	  array (whose size includes the null). this requires refactoring
	  the function to keep better track of where it is while parsing
	  including now the ability to have arbitrary amounts of whitespace
	  between words so that it will tokenize like the command line and
	  aren't bad run-on sentances the shiznits. bu_argv_from_string
	  still requires the caller to allocate enough space for the NULL
	  in the argv array and to manage the memory associated with the
	  input string; lim just doesn't include NULL in the count. the
	  count returned is similarly the matching argc for the number of
	  elements set in argv.

	* [r31173] src/nirt/nirt.1, src/nirt/nirt.c:
	  not short dammit. -s is silent mode.

	* [r31174] NEWS, src/rt/opt.c, src/rt/rtcheck.1,
	  src/rt/viewcheck.c:
	  bob added this option way back in 2005 ( 15 Aug 2005 21:43:07 to
	  be exact ) but it was never documented. this option makes rtcheck
	  write the plot file data in text format instead of the default
	  binary format. binary should probably not be the default, so
	  presumably this was a first step towards that direction; at least
	  it lets you get text instead of binary so you can avoid the tty
	  warning about binary output. reduce globals by one, the code is
	  updated to reuse the exist output_is_binary global instead of
	  using rt_text_output.

	* [r31175] TODO:
	  it really just causes too much confusion. z-clipping should be
	  off by default.

	* [r31176] TODO:
	  this has come up so many times over the year, it needs to be
	  documented so it can be eventually worked on. develop a low-level
	  tool for investigating, reporting statistics on, and repairing
	  geometry database files. the tool should nominally perform
	  big/little endian conversions, report number and types of
	  objects, allow deletion/undeletion/hiding/unhiding, provide some
	  general means to manipulate the packed and unpacked .g file data
	  for performing low-level modifications. this tool would directly
	  benefit both developers and users alike (particularly for
	  repairing catastrophic .g mistakes and for debugging).

	* [r31178] NEWS:
	  rather belated thanks to Daniel for finding/fixing the bu_ptbl
	  memory leak that was occuring during prep where delete_regs
	  wasn't getting freed from an rtip. this change was made in 28 Oct
	  2006 14:56:23 as CVS rev 14.17

2008-05-24 17:09  brlcad

	* [r31179] src/rt/main.c, src/rt/opt.c:
	  move output_is_binary to opt so that remrt can resolve the
	  reference

2008-05-26 22:20  starseeker

	* [r31180] src/nirt/nirt.c:
	  -e option works again, but supplying -f AFTER -e ignores the -f
	  flag - need to find out why. Works if -f is used before -e.

2008-05-26 22:26  starseeker

	* [r31181] src/nirt/nirt.c:
	  Initialization happens regardless, so only need it in one place -
	  before if.

	* [r31183] TODO, src/libfb/if_ogl.c:
	  better to be slow and visible than vast without a refresh.
	  haven't found why the buffer isn't refreshing yet, but it at
	  least restores functionality. maybe bob can track it down...

2008-05-27 02:06  brlcad

	* [r31184] NEWS:
	  annotate that bob added a -l option to the dbfindtree command so
	  that it'll return the paths in a list instead of the default
	  pretty-print tree. useful for scripting, presumably something
	  dave loman needed.
