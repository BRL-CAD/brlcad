	  This came up again... forward port and enable the most basic of
	  the search command size filters from r67646. This is just the
	  dp->d_len object size filter, but it pairs with the ls options
	  that can report size - with this in place, we can use ls -lS to
	  get an overall report of object sizes and then search with -size
	  and other filters to identify large or small subsets based on
	  type. Particular use case was trying to find a large plate mode
	  bot in the FAA Generic_Twin.g example: ls -lS to get an idea of
	  size distributions and then search -type plate -size >50000 to
	  find larger examples. Would be nice to be able to specify sorting
	  the search output on size at some point as well...

	* [r77061] include/bu/defines.h, include/common.h:
	  More uniformly define MAXPATHLEN across the code.
	  
	  Tcl defines MAXPATHLEN, and there was a potential for different
	  definitions between their headers and ours. Not certain, but that
	  is
	  one possible source of the strange realpath crash observed on
	  Linux
	  but not reproducible in isolation - if code with one definition
	  of
	  MAXPATHLEN created a buffer and then fed it to a library compiled
	  using
	  a different definition, those different assumptions are a source
	  of
	  possible trouble. I think that's what was happening with the
	  whoami.c
	  code after I switched it to using MAXPATHLEN. Previously that
	  code
	  called realpath directly rather than bu_file_realpath. After the
	  MAXPATHLEN switch, those raw realpath calls triggered a segfault
	  on
	  Linux - most likely due to a non-PATH_MAX definition of
	  MAXPATHLEN
	  previously being defaulted to by the bu/defines.h definition.
	  
	  Move the MAXPATHLEN definition to common.h, which is always
	  included
	  before tcl.h in our code, and add a couple definitions from the
	  Tcl
	  headers to use as fallbacks. Would be nice if there is some way
	  to
	  systematically check for this kind of issue...

	* [r76946] regress/repository/CMakeLists.txt,
	  regress/repository/repocheck.cpp, regress/repository/strnstr.c:
	  Checkpoint some work on the repocheck tool.
	  
	  brlcad.org's BSD is suddenly producing segfaults with the
	  repocheck
	  tool, which aren't reproduced on Linux. Debugging, it looks as if
	  the bu_mapped_file strings aren't being accepted by the C++
	  string
	  and strstr routines. The most likely cause is non-NULL
	  termination
	  of the bu_mapped_file buffer character arrays (which aren't
	  guaranteed).
	  Using the std::string constructor we can supply buflen from the
	  mapped
	  file to explicitly manage the content length, but strstr doesn't
	  have
	  such an option. The speedup from the strstr preliminary check is
	  considerable, but what strnstr implementations do exist are
	  fairly
	  platform specific. Instead, took a stab at creating a fast,
	  portable
	  "bu_strnstr" by altering OpenBSD's strstr implementation to
	  accept a
	  length limit. For now, just adding in with the repocheck since
	  this
	  is experimental, but it may be that this is a concern more
	  generally
	  with strstr operations on bu_mapped_files, and if so it may
	  belong
	  in libbu proper...

	* [r76841] CHANGES:
	  Experience with CDT proved it is better to implement convex hull
	  functions in such a way that the decision of whether to allocate
	  new arrays for vertices is left to the caller. Will need to
	  change function signatures, and provide separatew utility
	  functions that package up that bookkeeping.

	  Very simple cap on the number of times this message is printed.
	  bu_logging from the hit callback is generally not a great idea to
	  begin with, since you'll have lots of threads simultaneously
	  hitting bu_log most of the time... even if that's not an issue
	  for the application it's fairly hard to interpret. Better would
	  be to store any information we want to report about this issue
	  per-thread and then summarize it at the dispatcher level...

	* [r76822] src/libged/exec_mapping.cpp,

	  Rather than fatally aborting when we find a command mismatch on a

	  function name. This should work in every case the command would
	  originally have worked - the only failure would be if there is a
	  command that the plugin is supposed to be providing that didn't
	  get set up, which would be a legitimate bug on libged's end.

	* [r76821] src/libged/ged_util.c:
	  Listen for both stdout and stderr output from the rt tools - this
	  gets the summary in MGED GUI mode, but we still don't get
	  anything at all in classic mode. Not sure why yet.
	  tclcad_create_io_handler is being called, but
	  Tcl_CreateFileHandler is never triggered so
	  _ged_rt_output_handler isn't called. Apparently this was also
	  true in 72189, as the output is printed without the callback ever
	  being triggered there as well...

	  Extract CVS commit info from cvs-fast-export
	  
	  This script uses a cvs-fast-export conversion of the original CVS
	  repository without an authormap in order to extract the original
	  association between commit ids and commits. Because SHA1s won't
	  map for the main conversion, use a combination of message SHA1
	  and timestamp to uniquely identify the commits. When we move to
	  map this information into the final commit messages, we will
	  need to generate a similar map between this information and the
	  SHA1 values in the repowork input repository. Reading both maps
	  will then serve as a key connecting new SHA1 values to the old
	  CVS data.
	  
	  In addition, we also used the --first-parent option of rev-list
	  to follow the actual branch chains for the CVS conversions -
	  these will be recorded as cvs:branch: entries. Anything not
	  on a branch will be deemed to be cvs:branch:trunk commits.

	  slow to run, but in princile can diff every post-CVS commit. Pre
	  CVS is more problematic - there's not a guarantee things will
	  line up, as witnessed by the need for a sync commit between the
	  CVS and SVN histories, and the checkout pattern will change once
	  we get old enough. Can be done if someone wants to badly enough,
	  but the guarantees of matching aren't really there due to cvs2svn

	  Making scripts better reflect conversion process
	  
	  If at all avoidable, we don't want to have to manually update the
	  custom commit
	  information again now that repowork allows for post-conversion
	  email
	  manipulation. However, we also want account-map to be accurate.
	  The secondary
	  repositories in the SVN repository (rt3, geomcore, etc.) will
	  eventually be
	  converted with svn-fast-export - they do not use the custom
	  process developed
	  for the main history. Consequently, they will need a correct
	  account-map file
	  with the most current addresses.
	  
	  To handle this, we specifically stash the versions of the maps
	  that match the
	  custom commits currently checked in and update the conversion
	  scripts to reference
	  them specifically. Also stash the email mapping file used by
	  repowork, so we
	  can make sure we're capturing all updates made between the start
	  of the conversion
	  and the final post-processing.

	  Experiment with trying to spot recursive calls to callbacks - no
	  sure I like this even if it works, but especially in Tcl land
	  it's not hard to accidentally get into a recursive situation so
	  would be nice to have some sort of guard.

	* [r76350] src/libtclcad/tclcad_obj_wrapper.c:
	  Some of the libged commands need to update the views or otherwise
	  interact with the application environment - that's the purpose of
	  the various wrappers. It would be nice if the libged commands
	  could handle this themselves somehow rather than requiring the
	  parent application to know about the details of each command...

	  Start looking at what a Tcl-free asc2g will need. This a tall
	  order and not really possible in the general v5 ASC case, since
	  for v5 asc2g makes available libtclcad's commands and evaluates
	  the asc file as a Tcl script. The practical approach looks to be:
	  a) bring over v4 parsing without Tcl, which seems to be present
	  in asc2g. b) identify the subset of commands used by g2asc for
	  v5, and implement parsing and evaluation for those commands
	  specifically c) IFF b fails to read a file and Tcl is enabled
	  during compilation, fall back on the libtclcad Tcl evaluation to
	  import the file. Fully executed, we should be able to handle
	  anything written out by g2asc without Tcl (assuming there aren't
	  actual Tcl syntax evaluations buried in v5 somewhere) and if
	  someone has manually altered or created a more complex file that
	  actually hard requires Tcl we'll support if if Tcl is enabled.

	  Decent chance the copyright update explains the unanticiapted
	  file sha changes - revert to the old values until we get this
	  sorted out.

	* [r76268] misc/repoconv/custom/r29886_cjohnson_mac_hack.fi:
	  Urk. The copyright update script looks like it got some of the fi
	  files. Revert the data size change - correct fix is to repair the
	  fi files.

	  Couple odd things about these updates - in particular the
	  mac_hack file data block size was slightly different?? - but
	  updated so they can be applied to the current state. Since the
	  tag sha1 values keep getting updated, improve the script that
	  finds them for us given the availability of the older git
	  conversion - the manual mapping was a lot of work, so we don't
	  want to have to redo it if we can preserve the knowledge by sha1
	  lookup instead.

	  the qged logic itself.

	* [r76210] src/libdm/qt/dm-qt.cpp, src/libdm/qt/dm-qt.h,
	  src/libdm/qt/if_qt.cpp:
	  Turn off and update until this compiles. It was never finished,
	  and as things are now developing we should look at making this a
	  full fledged Qt-only dm/fb rather than trying to mix Tk and Qt.

	* [r76208] include/config_win.h.in:
	  For C++, newer standards let us do
	  std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1000)) and
	  avoid redefining sleep. Qt's qthread.h doesn't like our
	  (re)definition, so see if we can restrict it to C only - a quick
	  check doesn't seem to show much (any?) use of sleep in C++ in our
	  current code...

2020-06-25 21:34  starseeker

	* [r76207] include/config_win.h.in:
	  Hopefully with the facetize breakout we can put these back inside
	  the C++ protections, because close -> _close is not so good for
	  for .close() calls in C++...

	  Add a BRLCAD_ENABLE_TCL option (defaults to ON) and fix up
	  remaining build issues with Tcl fully out of the picture. Protect
	  liboptical's sh_tcl.c to allow liboptical to build without Tcl
	  (should really have liboptical use a libdm style plugin setup,
	  but this is lower impact for now and liboptical's API doesn't
	  seem to expose any Tcl bits), conditionalize various other bits
	  of the build logic that were assuming Tcl as a given, disable a
	  bunch of regression tests needing Tcl based utilities... Large
	  swaths of the code are of course turned off (libtclcad, mged,
	  archer, various utilities, etc.) but cmake
	  -DBRLCAD_ENABLE_TCL=OFF should now work. See if distcheck logic
	  needs updating - once a full distcheck can pass in this mode,
	  need another distcheck-full regression test for this
	  configuration.

	  Merge libdm and libfb into a plugin based library.
	  
	  This commit merges the dm-fb-merge branch's combination of libdm
	  and libfb into
	  a single library, using a new plugin-based architecture for
	  platform specific
	  backend logic. (The merger supports a clean plugin design - libdm
	  and libfb
	  must share backend specific information for features such as
	  embedded
	  framebuffers.)
	  
	  This commit marks a major milestone in that it is the realization
	  of a
	  years-long effort to lift Tcl/Tk usage up out of the core BRL-CAD
	  libraries
	  (libged and its dependencies.) Although it is true that Tcl/Tk is
	  currently
	  needed for all available graphical libdm backends, the new
	  plugin-based
	  architecture means Tcl/Tk is now a requirement only for the
	  plugin itself,
	  rather than all of BRL-CAD's libraries. There is no longer a
	  practical bar to
	  graphical libdm backends being implemented that are fully
	  independent of
	  Tcl/Tk.
	  
	  There are some API changes to support plugin loading and
	  information hiding,
	  but existing libdm/libfb users should find most functionality
	  relatively
	  unchanged - the libfb functions have not been reworked into a new
	  API, for
	  example (although someday that may be desirable to streamline the
	  libdm
	  design.) The major changes for developers will be including dm.h
	  rather than
	  fb.h, linking libdm rather than libfb, and using "struct dm" and
	  "struct fb"
	  rather than the dm and fb typedefs.

	* [r76195] src/libged/view/snap.c:
	  Demonstrate in principle snapping to the closest point to two
	  line segments if we are close to both of them. Need something
	  much better than a hard coded number for the tolerance, but the
	  mechanism itself seems to function.

2020-06-24 16:09  starseeker

	* [r76190] src/libged/qray.c:
	  since the error persisted for years, detect corrupt .mgedrc so a
	  more meaningful error can be reported.

2020-06-24 04:56  brlcad

	* [r76189] NEWS:
	  latently document a user-visible bug cliff fixed back in r66733
	  where corrupt .mgedrc files were being generated if a database
	  wasn't open. fix made the monster 7.26.0 release.

2020-06-23 19:22  starseeker

	* [r76188] include/bn/plane.h:
	  Note that plane.h really isn't a numerics API - needs to be
	  migrated to libbg now that it exists. Probably there are others
	  to move as well - clip.h and vlist.h are obvious candidates.

	* [r76180] src/libged/ged_private.h, src/libtclcad/tclcad_obj.c:
	  Initial stab at shifting libtclcad to calling libged function -
	  eventually will need to stage this properly through the view
	  command

2020-06-22 15:22  starseeker

	* [r76176] CMakeLists.txt, misc/CMake/RPath_Setup.cmake:
	  One of the things an eventual superbuild migration will require
	  is a separation between CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and the ultimate
	  BRLCAD_INSTALL_PREFIX (the latter being the superbuild's ultimate
	  installation destination, as opposed to the local paths used to
	  install the intermediate subbuilds.) BRL-CAD itself would be
	  build as a subbuild in this scenario, so it would have to target
	  an install step to a local CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX but still have a
	  different installed location 'baked in' to the code itself via
	  the configure headers and rpaths, which is something we haven't
	  previously done.

	  Start trying to figure out how to exercise the data_lines code.
	  Right now this is an Archer/libtclcad only functionality from the
	  looks of things... see if it can be factored down into libged so
	  we can test it in MGED.

	  CMake's install() throws a wrinkle into the generator expression
	  usage when
	  combined with add_custom_command. Somewhat surprisingly it looks
	  as if it can
	  work, but requires that the custom command be linked to a custom
	  target that
	  has ALL set so it gets triggered before install takes place. This
	  is necessary
	  because we can't pass generator expression paths into the OUTPUT
	  entry of
	  add_custom_command, so we can't establish a direct file
	  dependency in the build
	  process. Nor (as far as I can tell) can we explicitly set target
	  dependencies
	  for install rules, so we need the ALL enabled target to hook our
	  custom target
	  in under the install process.
	  
	  Until the lack of generator expression support in
	  add_custom_command's OUTPUT
	  specifiers is addressed
	  (https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/12877)
	  it's probably not worth reengineering the DocBook build to shift
	  us off the
	  existing mechanism - right now it looks like we would be trading
	  one
	  functional-but-ackward solution for what would probably end up
	  being another
	  functional-but-ackward solution.

	  specific to the command that generates a per-configuration stamp
	  file using the CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR variable to detect if the build
	  target has run for the current configuration. This has the
	  drawback that the build target will fail to detect the removal of
	  the per-config output and re-run, but it will re-run if the stamp

	  of the current BRL-CAD root hierarchy path in build scripts. This
	  is a bit tricky, but should be a bit more 'standard' than the
	  CURRENT_PATH custom mechanism originally added years ago for
	  pre-generator-expressions CMake builds to achieve the same
	  result. Regression tests are using this method currently - next
	  step will be to convert the DocBook logic to using it. It's not
	  clear yet if the build-type based install path customization can
	  use this approach. (Some portion of it will have to persist
	  regardless, as the once-per-configuration-change logic that
	  reworks the install files to update their paths depends on the
	  current-configuration-named file not being present on the
	  filesystem to trigger.)

	  for hiding library internal symbols during compilation, and
	  eliminate one of the common sources of Windows build problems
	  introduced by development on other platforms. The practical
	  consequence visible to developers will be that *_EXPORT labeling
	  of public functions in headers will now be necessary for all
	  platforms, not just Windows.

	  Will have to deprecate the original bot arg ordering - bot get is

	  self-contained we can make subcommands and still do the object
	  verification in one place, since we need to do some argv
	  management up front to match the old behavior (ick.) Might be
	  better to wrap the object lookup and check into a function and

	* [r75752] misc/CMake/BRLCAD_Targets.cmake:
	  AH! A subtle problem with the ENABLE_ALL build - if the build
	  decided to go ahead and do libged-obj as one of the first builds
	  (which it could because the obj build didn't have dependencies
	  set up - they're on the lib target itself) and it was using the
	  bundled png, it wouldn't be able to build successfully because
	  pnglibconf.h is generated by the png build. Since it wasn't
	  firing, libged-obj would only complete successfully if it could
	  a) find a pnglibconf.h somewhere else (which it apparently does
	  on some systems, even though with ENABLE_ALL it would be better
	  not to) or b) the ordering the build tool picked happend to
	  produce pnglibconf.h before getting the the libged-obj build. Fix
	  this by checking the libs list for build targets, and if any are
	  found make the object library target dependent on them so we
	  don't start on the lib objects until everything they depend on is
	  done.

	* [r75628] src/libdm/tests/tcl_img.cpp,
	  src/libdm/tests/tcl_tevent.cpp:
	  Needs to be hammered on/thought on a bit more, but set up the
	  image test to use ephemeral rendering threads that are managed by
	  an update manager that operates based on events. Idea is to
	  completely avoid time-based polling to see if work needs to be
	  done, but also to avoid having a lot of rendering events piling
	  up in an event queue and trialing on after we stop resizing. The
	  update manager takes the events and either triggers a render or
	  keeps track of the need to do another render once the current one
	  finishes. The render thread notifies the update manager once it
	  is complete via an event, which will kick off the GUI window
	  update and (if needed) start another render pass. Otherwise,
	  everything waits for a toplevel action to kick things off.

	  Making a simpler example to test the behavior of multiple threads

	  interp to process events successfully - it's not backed in to the
	  basic thread setup. With this setup, the goal is eventually val2
	  and val3 get large enough that the program exits if you resize

	  There we go. Tcl/Tk application with a rendering thread that's
	  updating a local pixel buffer and triggering update events in the
	  parent, which reads that buffer and updates its Tk_Photo
	  accordingly. Incorporates a delay in the rendering thread to
	  simulate a slow rendering pass. Doesn't start a new rendering
	  pass until the previous one is done - we don't want to waste time
	  catching up through a ton of queued rendering passes which are
	  already obsolete. However, it should always end up doing the
	  'final' rendering pass once things stabelize, as the last
	  movement will either coincide with the last rendering trigger or
	  will set the flag to do another rendering pass once the rendering
	  thread completes its current work.

	  against a system install with the src/other/tcl and src/other/tk

	  Fix vlist drawing by nirt, rtcheck, etc. broken by r75470.
	  
	  Fixing transparency exposed a problem in calls to invent_solid,
	  all of which had "0.0" as the transparency argument. It's pretty
	  clear the intention was to make temp vlists opaque (0%
	  transparent), but confusingly we use "transparency" as a synonym
	  for "alpha", so a transparency value of 0 actually means fully
	  transparent.

	  A long pathname displayed in the hint text when hovering over the
	  button was causing the window to resize, which would move the
	  button out from underneath the cursor, reverting the hint text to
	  a shorter string, moving the button back under the cursor,
	  triggering the longer hint text, ad infinitum. Now the buttons
	  stay in place when the window auto-resizes.

	* [r75378] NEWS, src/rt/viewedge.c:
	  Work around the rtedge -W problem reported by a user where the
	  rtedge lines are still drawn white even though the white
	  background is specified. This broke in commit r68597, but it
	  looks as if the implementation even prior to that does what's
	  intended rather oddly, in a way only considered the -W white
	  background case. -C 240/240/240, for example, does not produce
	  the dark line but is clearly a background that would benefit from
	  it. Only -W changes the default_background flag internally, but
	  adjusting -C to do the same won't do either, since -C 1/1/1 would
	  then produce a black line and a black-on-black image. The correct
	  answer is to calculate a color difference metric, but until
	  that's solved this should restore the black/white and white/black
	  cases where are the most common for line drawings.

	  fontconfig - when we mix our bundled freetype (and libpng and
	  zlib) with a
	  system fontconfig it's generally no-go.
	  
	  A bundled fontconfig has been a daunting challenge to date - its
	  build is
	  multi-step, using Perl to generate headers and autotools for the
	  main build
	  flow. Moreover, at compile time directories are hardcoded where
	  fontconfig
	  expects to look for fonts and cache entries. Both of these need
	  to be addressed
	  somehow for a 'bundled' fontconfig to work.
	  
	  This commit is the beginnings of addressing the problem, starting
	  with the
	  build process. Rather than attempt to duplicate the full build
	  process, we'll
	  take a stripped down, minimalist approach of pulling in any
	  generated headers
	  we can unless/until there is some clear utility in implementing
	  all the build
	  steps in a more self contained manner. Building is untested on
	  Windows (it may
	  not be needed there, I'll have to check Tk to see).
	  
	  The second part of the embedding - looking for fonts and
	  processing them -
	  hasn't been looked at yet - right now if you enable this mged
	  will segfault
	  with the message "Fontconfig error: Cannot load default config
	  file". It will
	  need some design thought, since what we actually want for this is
	  a relative
	  path runtime lookup in a share/fonts directory in BRL-CAD's
	  runtime hierarchy.
	  It's not clear yet what the best way to achieve that is.

	  Merge tcltk86 branch back into trunk, using Tcl/Tk 8.6.10.
	  Itcl/Itk 3.4 enabled by default for Archer. Untested on Mac OSX
	  (especially with Aqua) - there's almost certainly build work
	  needed on that platform. Doing this now to modernize our Tcl/Tk
	  foundation - even if we have to keep Itcl/Itk 3 for a while 8.6
	  is the mainstream version.

	  approach has proven to be largely not worthwhile, and the new
	  find_package -D<pkg>_ROOT searching behavior in post 3.12 should
	  provide a simple way to point at a specific Tcl/Tk installation
	  for those that want/need the flexibility.

	  __STDC__ was not set, but via common.h->config_win.h in the build
	  unfortunately, __STDC__ influenses the presence of off_t (for

	  as we can, but this is not an ability built into the current zlib
	  ecosystem so we'll probably have to maintain 3rd party patches to
	  use it properly. However, given the number of compatibility
	  issues we've hit inadvertantly mixing system and bundled zlib and
	  libpng (Mac OSX is especially bad in this respect) it's probably

	* [r74969] src/libdm/dm-generic.c, src/mged/dozoom.c:
	  Notional fix of transparency in MGED.
	  
	  This makes the -x [0.0,1.0] option to "e" work in MGED, provided
	  lighting and
	  transparency are enabled (dm set lighting 2, dm set transparency
	  1).
	  
	  To implement transparency, MGED draws opaque stuff first, then
	  does a second
	  pass of transparent stuff with the depth mask disabled so back
	  faces are
	  blended instead of culled.
	  
	  The current implementation has the two passes done using the same
	  function with
	  different transparency thresholds, first 1, then ~.999
	  (nextafter(1.0, 0.0)).
	  
	  The first problem is that only objects >= threshold are being
	  drawn, so the
	  second call should be ~0, not ~.999 in order to draw transparent
	  stuff.
	  
	  The second problem is that using a one-sided threshold would seem
	  to
	  technically draw all the opaque objects twice, though there may
	  be some
	  implementation detail I'm missing that prevents this.
	  
	  I corrected the threshold value for the second pass. I also
	  changed the draw
	  function to operate in two modes based on the threshold, which
	  feels like the
	  original intention, but also doesn't seem like the correct way to
	  do this.

	  implement any sort of flag - the underlying BRep data types are
	  in fact representing plate mode objects when written back to the
	  .g file. Two modes - one puts the specified set of faces (all by
	  default) into a single multi-plate BRep object, and the other
	  produces a comb unioning one-brep-per-face plate mode BRep
	  objects. The advantage of the latter is an ability to
	  individually inspect and remove specific faces.

	* [r74566] src/libbrep/cdt/edge.cpp, src/libbrep/cdt/mesh.cpp:
	  Add more debugging info, use the same uedges lookup pattern as

	* [r74564] src/libbrep/cdt/cdt.cpp, src/libbrep/cdt/mesh.cpp:
	  Print more information. If I recall correctly there are
	  provisions for duplicate points around closed areas as a way to
	  handle the initial breakdown of loops, but it looks like various
	  parts of the code aren't agreeing on which of those duplicates to
	  use and consequently we're not getting a canonical lookup. Will
	  have to look into it in more detail.

	* [r74563] src/libbrep/cdt/mesh.cpp:
	  Add debugging code to zero in on the addition of a specific

	  point indices on the uedges...

	* [r74562] src/libbrep/cdt/cdt.cpp:
	  refine the plotting somewhat - don't plot expected results on

2019-12-25 14:09  starseeker

	* [r74561] src/libbrep/cdt/cdt.cpp, src/libbrep/cdt/ovlps.cpp:
	  Plot the edges and faces. The visual pattern is clear - the
	  invalidity is related to the closed surface edges. The 3d->2d
	  mappings there are not unique, so we'll have to think about how
	  to handle it in a useful fashion. The audit function looks like
	  it is wrong in that it's not happy when it gets two triangles on
	  a single face on a closed edge, which is right, but we clearly
	  have a lookup failure on a triangle with one edge vert using a
	  vertex from the closed surface edge, which needs to work.

	  May be overkill doing it this way, but try adding a point into a
	  mesh that has triangles close to a newly split brep edge curve.
	  Idea is we want all the meshes to line up in terms of their
	  vertices where they might interfere, and while a new edge vert
	  may not intrude into the other mesh associated triangles using
	  that vert might. The proposed method of correcting those
	  situations needs aligned vertices, so try to make sure we will
	  have them. Untested.

	  We're probably not ready for all-up pix diffing on NURBS images
	  for regression, but there is something else we can do. Specific
	  shots can be identified as unambiguous hits or misses based on
	  visual inspection of the shapes - adding a lower level call to
	  the nirt logic in libanalyze, we can detect when those specific
	  shots are hitting or missing incorrectly. The nirt API is
	  probably much too heavy for this, but it's I/O logic was already
	  specifically set up to read in floating point strings at high
	  fidelity for a similiar situation where we needed to exactly
	  reproduce rays from string inputs. The example added is a case in
	  NIST3 that illustrates an unexpected hit with the current trunk
	  logic. The comparison is currently deliberately simple and
	  binary, without attempting to assess the correctness of hit
	  points or partitions.
