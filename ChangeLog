	* [r38842] NEWS:
	  probably most significant user-visible change, bob fixed the Mac
	  input bug that was affecting 10.5+ platforms where mouse input
	  would stall during interactive rotations. this would occur after
	  a zoom (mouse click) event. Bob removed the calls to focus for
	  button presses (even though they should be fine, so there's still
	  something screwy).

	* [r38841] NEWS:
	  The backout/-b option to nirt is suppose to back the ray origin
	  point out of the geometry. Internally the origin point was
	  actually being backed up by the bounding sphere diameter. This
	  backout method will still miss geometry if your origin point is
	  out past the bounding sphere distance. This option now backs out
	  a bounding sphere radius distance in front of the bounding
	  sphere. Fixed with r38575 by keith.

	* [r38839] NEWS:
	  improved the performance of the X11 (dm X) wireframes in
	  mged/archer/rtwizard by substantially eliminating memory
	  allocations for colors. this is giving about a 5-10x performance
	  boost to the wireframe allowing highly detailed models to display
	  more interactively.

	  definite improvement for release.

2010-04-28 03:07  brlcad

	* [r38837] src/libdm/dm-X.c:
	  replace the proof-of-concept with something slightly less
	  impressive but still with a dash of awesome. improve the
	  performance of the X display manager by eliminating repeat
	  XAllocColor() calls. original test bed showed about an order of
	  magnitude improvement and had O(1) lookup time, but ate about
	  200MB of memory. this uses a bu_list to stash the colors so we
	  only use as much as we need. seems to be still about a 5x-10x
	  performance improvement over always doing the color lookups.
	  
	  we presently don't free any of the memory we allocate in this
	  static function, so there does need to be further work to
	  periodically release these resources at least on dm close or
	  atexit if not earlier.
	  
	  wireframes are nice and smooth again where previously very
	  chunky. makes 1 havoc go from about 1.5 fps to about 10 fps.
	  makes 10 havocs go from 0.4 fps to about 2 fps.

	* [r38835] src/libdm/dm-X.c, src/libdm/dm-tk.c:
	  initialize all of the XColor local structures. otherwise, the
	  structures can have random memory contents where the flags,
	  padding, and initial pixel values might be non-zero. init to zero
	  reflects expectation. also include debug code (ifdef0'd) on dm-X

	  disappearing on the vlist, but easy to reproduce so should be
	  traceable.

	  recursively but ending up with some Makefile.am scan failure if
	  the directory is recursive. This makes the path absolute and
	  reportedly quiets those failures (for autoconf 2.64, automake

	  The html viewers (man page and docs both) appear to be having
	  problems with encoding similar to those described here -
	  http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/SpecialChars.html. This
	  appears to be due to the Tcl encoding not being set to an

	* [r38717] include/bu.h:
	  printing a size_t as %llu causes va_arg major grief (even with

	* [r38716] NEWS:
	  keith added the '-u model' option to rtarea which specifies that

	* [r38653] src/libged/rt.c:
	  Added logic to ged_rt(...) to append "-u model" to 'rtarea'
	  command when the user does not specify the output units
	  explicitly. This means that 'rtarea' when run from within 'mged'
	  will produce results in the current working model units unless
	  overridden by the user. Note: For backward compatibility with
	  existing scripts running 'rtarea' from the system command
	  line(not from within mged) will still produce output in mm^2
	  unless otherwise specified with the '-u' option.

2010-04-20 18:18  indianlarry

	* [r38652] src/rt/viewarea.c:
	  Added external reference to 'model_units' flag. Added warning
	  when using current model units as result units. Added some
	  limited logic to show a common larger unit in the parenthesized
	  portion of the result: mm^2,cm^2, dm^2 -> m^2, m^2 -> km^2, in^2
	  -> ft^2, ft^2 -> yd^2 otherwise defaults to mm^2.

2010-04-20 18:17  indianlarry

	* [r38651] src/rt/opt.c:
	  Added 'model' keyword to the '-u' units option parsing. When the
	  'model' keyword is passed as the units option a 'model_units'
	  flag is set signaling programs like 'rtarea' to produce results
	  in the current model working units.

	  substantial overhaul of offset management for mem_map objects,
	  db_scan()/db5_sca() handlers and dbi's dbi_eof position (from
	  scan). make them off_t's instead of size_t's as they do represent
	  file and memory offsets, not sizes. it's also a signed type so
	  the -1 marker we use all over the place won't get converted
	  through to a potentially unsigned type.

2010-04-13 15:16  brlcad

	* [r38536] src/librt/prep.c:
	  we're comparing longs

2010-04-13 15:13  brlcad

	* [r38535] src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	  follow erik's fixes with a few more ssize_t conversions on the
	  writev() calls.

2010-04-13 14:55  brlcad

	* [r38534] src/other/tk/win/wish.exe.manifest:
	  our msvc build files for wish utilize tk's cygwin tk.rc resource
	  build file, which relies on wish.exe.manifest having been
	  generated during a configure pass. since this isn't feasible,
	  create a manifest manually and add it here so the build will at
	  least succeed.

2010-04-13 13:44  erikgreenwald

2010-04-13 13:32  erikgreenwald

	  more casting

2010-04-13 13:22  erikgreenwald

	* [r38529] src/libbu/ptbl.c:
	  cast off_t to size_t when comparing with size_t (signed vs
	  unsigned warning)

2010-04-13 12:31  brlcad

	* [r38528] src/libfb/fbserv_obj.c, src/libfb/if_disk.c:
	  more quellage. don't mess with casting Tcl_Channels to numbers,
	  just pass them through.

2010-04-13 12:21  brlcad

	* [r38527] include/config_win.h:
	  ignore warnings for type cast: conversion from type1 to type2 of

2010-04-13 12:17  brlcad

	* [r38526] src/libfb/fbserv_obj.c:

2010-04-13 12:16  brlcad

	* [r38525] src/libfb/if_wgl.c:
	  visual is unused, remove. de-k&r wgl_open().

2010-04-13 12:16  brlcad

	* [r38524] include/config_win.h:
	  4127 is 'conditional expression is constant' which can be
	  intended for not, but seem to very much intended in most cases
	  (asserts and debug tests.

2010-04-13 11:54  brlcad

	* [r38523] include/common.h:
	  pragma warning is only relevant with the MSVC compiler so check
	  for _MSC_VER.

2010-04-13 11:48  brlcad

	* [r38522] include/config_win.h:
	  re-enable msvc warnings 4244, 4305, and 4018, but disable 4996 --
	  secure function deprecation warnings where it blathers about
	  insecure sprintf-style functions being deprecated.

2010-04-13 11:43  brlcad

	* [r38521] src/libbu/xdr.c:
	  cast the uint16_t's to unsigned char's too, quellage.

2010-04-13 11:37  brlcad

	* [r38520] include/common.h:
	  totally punt for windows and turn off reporting unreferenced
	  formal parameters (c4100). alternative would be to call
	  UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER() in the function body (which presumably
	  sets the parameter to itself or some similar hack), but I'm not
	  feeling it given they're already identified in a more open
	  declarative manner for gcc.

2010-04-13 11:30  brlcad

	* [r38519] include/fb.h:
	  need tk.h and (apparently) windows.h for the signature to compile
	  syntax clean

2010-04-13 08:19  brlcad

	* [r38518] include/fb.h:
	  wgl needs it's requisite headers too (untested)

2010-04-13 08:08  brlcad

	* [r38517] src/libbu/fnmatch.c:
	  set var outside of expression

2010-04-13 08:01  brlcad

	* [r38516] include/config_win.h:
	  make isblank() a define instead of a static function to quell
	  unused warnings as well as to make fnmatch.c successfully test
	  for it via #ifdef

2010-04-13 07:52  brlcad

	* [r38515] src/libfb/if_disk.c:

	* [r38514] src/other/tcl/win/tclWinPort.h,
	  src/other/tk/win/tkWinPort.h:
	  apply a mod to tcl/tk (already pushed upstream as patch) to
	  conditionally define strcasecmp/strcasencmp so that the header
	  may be included after ours without causing redefinition warnings.

2010-04-13 07:42  brlcad

	* [r38513] include/bu.h, src/libbu/ptbl.c:
	  convert bu_ptbls over to using off_t and size_t for their end

2010-04-13 07:33  brlcad

	* [r38512] include/raytrace.h:

2010-04-13 06:28  brlcad

	  report 2974586 (Core Dump with mged 'solids' Command) where a
	  stack trace showed a bogus vls. since we don't know how memory
	  will be initialized, calling bu_vls_init_if_uninit() here is

	  Merge in tkpng 0.9 to replace tkimg - unlike last time, just
	  duplicate the tkimg approach already present and tweak the Archer
	  loader to use tkpng instead. No more incorrect than it already
	  was, and this should avoid issues tkimg seems to be having with
	  libpng 1.4.1 - will go away altogether once upgrade to tk 8.6
	  happens.

	  src/tclscripts/mged/tclIndex:
	  add a new tcl command for mged called 'remap_mater'. the command
	  remaps material IDs in the currently open geometry database file
	  based on simple remap rules in a specified input file. the
	  command is related to the existing 'remat' command, but provides
	  distinctively different behavior. the command was implemented by
	  PJT in December 2000 and manually being shared amongst users. now
	  it's included directly.

2010-03-31 21:48  starseeker

	* [r38286] src/fb/Makefile.am, src/fb/fbthreadtest.c:
	  Toss in a temporary, minimalist 'display a pix image using a tk
	  photo' program that will be used for isolated testing of Tcl
	  threads and how they interact with Tk photo drawing - not (yet)
	  simulating raytracing, just preparing to work on basics. This

	  slew of warning eliminations including conversion of exact
	  floating point comparisons to nearness tests. this will require
	  some testing (affects bigE, bot_dump, and clone in particular),
	  but rudimentary testing looks good thus far.

2010-03-31 04:59  brlcad

	* [r38265] include/vmath.h:
	  even relatively new code presenting problems with exact

	  usage func.

2010-03-31 03:43  brlcad

	* [r38263] src/libfb/Makefile.am:

	  quellage of all strict verbose compilation warnings consisting of
	  mostly parameter checking. additional static initializers on the
	  FBIOs. lot of sanity tests and unused parameter decls. should be
	  no logic changes.

2010-03-31 02:45  brlcad

	* [r38260] include/fbio.h:
	  looks like FBIO union 'l' param is a length parameter so make it

	  unused params, fix sign conversions, remove unnecessary funcs
	  (tk_close_existing), and lil more.

2010-03-30 23:54  brlcad

	* [r38258] src/libdm/Makefile.am:
	  passes verbose compilation on 32-bit mac and 64-bit linux.

	  strict.

2010-03-30 23:53  brlcad

	* [r38257] src/libdm/dm_obj.c:
	  cast through uintptr_t first so we don't lose precision.

2010-03-26 04:10  brlcad

	* [r38183] src/librt/primitives/bot/bot.c:

	* [r38153] src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  More updates to the general preferences tab. More specifically
	  the binding modes and background color interface has been reduced
	  to two comboboxes. The ADC tab has been removed. Lastly, the list
	  of units for the units combobox needed a little massaging (i.e.
	  removal of extra white space in the units names).

2010-03-24 17:33  bob1961

	* [r38152] misc/win32-msvc8/brlcad/brlcad.sln:

2010-03-24 17:20  bob1961

	* [r38148] include/bu.h, src/libbu/units.c:
	  Added a function to return a vls containing a comma separated
	  list of short units names. Also changed the short name for

	  short name.

2010-03-23 23:48  brlcad

2010-03-23 18:10  indianlarry

	* [r38142] include/opennurbs_ext.h:
	  Function getCurveEstimateOfV() wasn't always converging to a
	  solution before hitting iteration bound. Now uses binary
	  subdivision of curve 't' parameter until derivatives at end
	  points in 'u' are within 5 percent before using the original
	  linear estimating method. Also increased the iteration bound to
	  1000.

	* [r38118] src/libgcv/obj/obj_grammar.y,

2010-03-19 20:36  erikgreenwald

	* [r38107] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_tri_mc.c:
	  Don't compute normals since NMG's don't take them. Fix pairing

	* [r38068] NEWS:
	  fixed a bug in obj-g where it was crashing if there were multiple
	  objects in the obj file. the vertex/face data was getting
	  released when a bot is written out, leaving much room for
	  platform/environment-spefic crashness. improved memory management
	  with a new data container though still more work is needed.

2010-03-16 10:52  brlcad

	* [r38067] src/conv/obj-g.c:
	  good grief, messy wild assumptions going on in here regarding
	  faces. fix a processing bug that was causing a crash due to the
	  parsed face and vertex data (which was being stashed in a bot
	  internal) getting released during export. instead, stash the
	  vertex/face data into its own container that is memory managed
	  separately. since face ids accummulate as the file is procesed,
	  keep them all even as we write out groups. this in-core approach
	  blindly and stupidly expands vertices as they're added to bots
	  just as a matter of simplicity. parsing logic still needs
	  revamping to support 1/2/3 per face vertex indices and
	  non-triangular polygons.

2010-03-11 00:15  brlcad

	* [r37999] src/libged/ged_private.h, src/libged/put_comb.c,
	  src/libged/red.c:
	  restructure to avoid forward declarations. fix bug introduced
	  with the removal of the 'unnecessary' _ged_tmpcomb_init global..
	  which was a hack to reinit a global being used to temporarily
	  stash a name. instead rework the functions that were using it to
	  pass the new name around instead of relying on the global.

	  using paul's instead of our own fellow doug gwyn's work

	  non-uint32_t systems. common.h needs to guarantee that the c99
	  types are provided so they can be used unconditionally. not quite
	  sure how that's not happening now even for non-BRLCADBUILD
	  systems, so can't try a fix. at worse, we can provide our own
	  stdint.h for systems missing the types.

2010-03-03 06:46  brlcad

	  OK, the child still returns, but the destroy event for the window

2010-03-02 18:37  starseeker

2010-03-02 18:31  starseeker

2010-03-02 06:26  brlcad

	  poorly tested

2010-02-23 07:04  brlcad

	* [r37716] src/libged/ged_private.h, src/libged/rt.c:
	  move the struct into the only file that actually uses it.

2010-02-23 06:26  brlcad

	* [r37714] include/common.h:
	  still not perfect but this should help things along for 3rd party
	  codes that don't have a HAVE_SSIZE_T define. only provide the
	  typedef if we can't find hint of SSIZE_MAX. (untested)

2010-02-23 06:10  brlcad

2010-02-23 05:33  starseeker

2010-02-23 05:31  brlcad

	* [r37709] include/common.h:
	  need to include the header that provides ptrdiff_t if we're going
	  to typedef it, otherwise needs to turn into a #define instead.

2010-02-23 04:00  erikgreenwald

	* [r37708] src/adrt/load_g.c:
	  disable NMG fastloading for now

2010-02-23 01:05  starseeker

	* [r37706] configure.ac:
	  Have the AC_CHECK_TYPE for ssize_t define HAVE_SSIZE_T if found,
	  so the conditional in common.h will work (not defined on gentoo
	  amd64 in testing - not sure if this is needed universally).

2010-02-22 21:14  brlcad

	* [r37705] include/common.h:
	  if we don't have ssize_t (e.g., windows), use ptrdiff_t instead.
	  it should be a signed type that matches pointer size and is c99.

2010-02-22 21:13  brlcad

	* [r37704] include/config_win.h:
	  don't typedef ssize_t here. since it's part of public API, common
	  needs to provide it. instead expand and group some of the basic
	  c99 stdint types.

2010-02-22 20:55  brlcad

	* [r37703] configure.ac:

2010-02-20 16:53  brlcad

	* [r37696] NEWS, src/conv/obj-g.c:
	  add support for parsing files with a 'o' object name. blender
	  uses 'o' instead of 'g' for the object name, others probably do
	  too. also, make all unrecognized lines simply get ignored
	  (non-fatally) so that it won't just halt on something unexpected.
	  also, unroll a few lines; someone's editor apparently can't
	  handle 256 lines in a file or something.

	* [r37688] src/libged/dg_obj.c:
	  oops, helps to compile. missing TCL_VOLATILE. let it know that it
	  needs to make a copy of the vls string.

2010-02-19 16:38  brlcad

	* [r37687] src/libged/dg_obj.c:

2010-02-19 16:31  brlcad

	* [r37686] src/librt/db_tree.c:
	  and the bu_vlses have it!.. so far, testing seems to be all good

	  for others to follow.

2010-02-19 13:04  erikgreenwald

	  that needs escaping, the input is wrapped in curlies.

2010-02-19 05:48  brlcad

	* [r37678] src/librt/db_tree.c:
	  implement the non DString method alongside the vls method so that

2010-02-19 05:32  brlcad

	* [r37677] src/librt/db_tree.c:

	  Take a stab at breaking the density buffer parsing out of gqa
	  into libanalyze. Currently, rtweight will not handle things like
	  comments in .density files, since those improvements were
	  specific to gqa. Need a shared, generic routine - not totally
	  sure yet if file/database sourcing functions should also be in
	  libanalyze, so for the moment move just the parsing logic. Next
	  step will be to get rtweight to use this style of density

	  Removed "noinst" library build and reverted back to linking in
	  objects directly. 'step-g' uses initialization of static class
	  variables to self register AP203 classes to an object factory
	  without the need to list every new class in an explicit
	  registration routine. Linking across a static library was causing
	  objects to be dropped if they weren't somehow referenced from
	  "main" and therefore wouldn't get initialized. Shared libraries
	  work better in this regard and will go that route when needed by
	  other Apps.

	* [r37576] src/other/tnt/jama_cholesky.h, src/other/tnt/jama_eig.h,
	  src/other/tnt/jama_lu.h, src/other/tnt/jama_svd.h,
	  src/other/tnt/tnt_linalg.h:
	  remove the using namespace declarations as they cause symbol
	  collisions and ambiguous call errors. this may be incomplete, but
	  it fixes the portions we use. jama looked to be the most abusive.

	* [r37575] NEWS, README, include/conf/PATCH:
	  bump to 7.16.7, alas still expecting at least one more release on
	  the 7.16 line to fix the mac input bug and get all of the 64-bit
	  windows changes in. this should be a bugfix-only release.

	  Getting set up to move the MGED commands to mann with a .nged
	  prefix. As a first step, move those reported to have conflicts by
	  gentoo, but all MGED commands will need to be moved. brlman
	  script also needed a minor tweak to handle manpage extensions
	  that weren't an exact match for the man* character in the
	  directory name. Not clear yet if it can handle specifying 1 vs. 3
	  vs. n man pages, but for commands like rt it will eventually need
	  to - look into it.

	* [r37570] src/libdm/dm-rtgl.c:
	  Missing entry in rtgl struct - new slot for drawVListHiddenLine

2010-02-04 22:56  brlcad

	* [r37569] src/libged/move_all.c:
	  clean up the usage statement to use consistent notation for
	  required/optional parameters. '[]' are optional, '{}' is a
	  logical grouping (to indicate mutually exclusive options), '<>'
	  is optional markup indicating substituted user input (normally
	  with italics, e.g. man page, but this is plain text).

2010-02-04 22:45  brlcad

	* [r37568] include/bu.h:
	  add a little note to make it clear that the vls may be extended
	  more than extra length requested.

2010-02-04 22:41  brlcad

	* [r37567] regress/repository.sh:
	  add an additional release check to make sure all of our configure
	  options are documented in the INSTALL file. don't halt the build
	  just yet, though, as there are at least 5 that have crept in
	  without documentation. (to be dealt with after 7.16.6 is tagged)

	* [r37565] configure.ac, misc/Makefile.am, misc/debian:
	  remove misc/debian .. those files are so out-of-date and wrong
	  that it's just misleading and bloat. many of the files still
	  referenced glpong and had wrong license info.

	* [r37562] src/libbu/vls.c:
	  modify the default minimum and step allocation sizes to be
	  word-aligned allocation sizes. make bu_vls_extend() obey the step
	  size and increment ONLY in step-sized increments, not just at
	  least that much.

	  the getpass() function is in -lbsd on some platforms (e.g.,
	  haiku), so check for it.
