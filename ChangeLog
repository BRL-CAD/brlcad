2013-06-13 15:55  erikgreenwald

	* [r55743] src/adrt/isst_tcltk.c:
	  use bio.h instead of a wrapped windows.h

2013-06-13 15:48  erikgreenwald

	* [r55742] src/libdm/dm-wgl.c:
	  add comment on why TkWinInt.h is needed

2013-06-13 15:48  brlcad

	* [r55741] src/adrt/CMakeLists.txt:
	  right, they gotta match

2013-06-13 15:46  brlcad

	  cope with windows tcl _init func. use DM_WGL_TYPE on windows.

2013-06-13 15:38  brlcad

	* [r55738] NEWS:
	  after way too many revisions and rewrites, lock in on a
	  reasonable showcase summary for this release. the emphasis is
	  intentionally on archer though there are a lot of other major
	  changes worth noting too. plan is to highlight some of them in
	  patch updates (e.g., affinity, lod wireframes, vol/SA calcs).

2013-06-13 15:34  erikgreenwald

	* [r55737] src/adrt/isst_tcltk.c:
	  tkWinInt.h is just being used to include windows.h, so just use
	  windows.h

2013-06-13 13:37  brlcad

	  look at thread affinity locking on linux

2013-06-13 13:36  brlcad

	* [r55735] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  default thread affinity locking to OFF for release since
	  something is reportedly wrong on Linux, need to investigate why
	  all cpus not getting used.

2013-06-13 13:34  n_reed

2013-06-12 20:38  carlmoore

	* [r55732] src/fb/fbcbars.c:
	  insert missing 'e' in options in Usage; remove h (high-res); add
	  h,? and run-with-no-arguments for help; 'sets mode to' inserted
	  in 3 places to avoid the appearance of needed ARGUMENT

2013-06-12 19:42  starseeker

	* [r55731] misc/CMake/BRLCAD_Targets.cmake,
	  src/adrt/CMakeLists.txt:
	  CMake's install command doesn't preserve the executable flag with
	  the FILES option, so add a way to tell the macro it's installing
	  a script.

2013-06-12 19:41  carlmoore

	* [r55730] src/fb/fb-png.c, src/fb/fbanim.c:
	  remove old h (high-res); implement help via ?,h

2013-06-12 19:38  r_weiss

2013-06-12 16:43  carlmoore

	  cosmetic stuff (comparing with a-d.c)

2013-06-12 16:41  carlmoore

	* [r55722] src/fb/fb-orle.c:
	  change old h to H (do not see other alternate), and use h and ?
	  for help; never mind 'DEPRECATED' message, which didn't print

	  src/adrt/isst, src/adrt/isst_tcltk.c:
	  redo isst to use libdm instead of togl

2013-06-12 14:12  starseeker

	* [r55717] misc/CMake/BRLCAD_Targets.cmake,
	  src/adrt/CMakeLists.txt:
	  isst wasn't using the brlcad target macros for its library
	  because it needed a custom install directory location. Rather
	  than ditch the macro setup (which does lots of nice things
	  automatically) add the NO_INSTALL option already used for
	  executables to the library macro as well. This lets us pass the
	  NO_INSTALL flag for the isst library to disable the automatic
	  install call and we can instead substitute our own customized
	  version.

2013-06-12 07:16  phoenixyjll

	* [r55714] src/libged/gqa.c:
	  Simplified the "gqa" command logic for testing if the

2013-06-11 20:42  carlmoore

	* [r55711] src/fb/bw-fb.c, src/fb/fb-bw.c:
	  Implement -h and -? in fb-bw (removing old -h); and make 1
	  cosmetic change in bw-fb.c

2013-06-11 20:07  starseeker

	* [r55710] src/librt/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/librt/primitives/bot/bot_wireframe.cpp:
	  Add (commented out) file that attemps to make nicer bot
	  wireframes using a surface patch breakout technique. Proving to
	  be too slow for interactive use in its current form - hot spot is
	  determing which faces share the edges with any one particular
	  face, and even if that can somehow be made fast the
	  pre-processing really should be done in parallel. Checkpointing
	  so a revert point is available.

2013-06-11 17:20  starseeker

	* [r55709] misc/CMake/CompilerFlags.cmake:
	  Don't always add compiler flags to C group - some flags are C++
	  only

2013-06-11 13:11  carlmoore

	* [r55708] src/rt/view.c:
	  correct lu vs. d discrepancy between variable & format
	  specification; also remove unneeded braces

2013-06-10 22:49  brlcad

	* [r55707] src/libged/gqa.c:
	  introducing new magic numbers (literal values) without
	  explanation is taboo, go with something (an order of magnitude)
	  that should be defensible. value is still significantly smaller
	  than the previous quarter-mm value...

2013-06-10 22:42  brlcad

	* [r55706] src/libged/gqa.c:
	  key off any negative tolerance value for weight/volume, not just
	  the specific value we initialized with

2013-06-10 20:49  carlmoore

	* [r55705] src/sig/i-f.c:
	  cosmetic stuff, to look as much as possible like d-f.c

	  remove duplicate prototypes

2013-06-10 18:03  carlmoore

	* [r55701] src/util/pixscale.c, src/util/pixshrink.c:
	  remove old -h (high-res); use h,?,run-with-no-arguments for help

2013-06-10 17:47  n_reed

	* [r55700] include/common.h:
	  don't want to remove inline uses from cpp files

2013-06-10 16:39  brlcad

	* [r55699] include/common.h:
	  __STRICT_ANSI__ is not the right define to key off of as it
	  catches c89 and c99 (for gcc and clang). if we're compililing
	  gnu89 pedantic, we need to check for GNU inline behavior, which
	  is indicated for gcc 4.1+ and clang via the __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__
	  define. leaving __STRICT_ANSI__ in place to not rock the windows
	  boat prior to release.

2013-06-10 13:10  erikgreenwald

2013-06-07 22:42  r_weiss

	* [r55697] src/libged/gqa.c:
	  Updates to 'gqa' command to improve results with default settings

2013-06-07 20:29  carlmoore

	* [r55696] src/util/pix-ps.c:
	  implement -h and -? (removing old -h high-res)

2013-06-07 19:32  carlmoore

	* [r55695] src/util/pix-png.c:
	  don't need those 2 case statements; just use default

2013-06-07 18:14  carlmoore

	* [r55694] src/sig/i-d.c:
	  add a blank line (cosmetic comparison with d-i.c) and initialize
	  scale in the type statement

2013-06-07 17:00  erikgreenwald

	* [r55693] doc/docbook/system/man1/en/fbclear.xml:
	  rebalance the XML so it can be parsed

2013-06-07 16:59  phoenixyjll

	* [r55692] src/libbrep/intersect.cpp:
	  Try to add PS support using get_closest_point().

2013-06-07 15:29  carlmoore

	* [r55691] src/sig/u-f.c:
	  move scale=1.0 into the type declaration

2013-06-07 15:25  carlmoore

	* [r55690] src/sig/d-u.c, src/sig/u-d.c:
	  cosmetic changes for d-u.c/u-d.c file comparison, and in u-d.c
	  implement 'double scale=1.0;'

2013-06-07 14:57  carlmoore

	* [r55689] src/sig/bw-d.c:
	  remove math.h reference, which d-bw.c did not have, and I did
	  make to make sure this didn't break anything

2013-06-07 14:54  carlmoore

	* [r55688] src/sig/bw-d.c, src/sig/d-bw.c:
	  changes (preset of scale =1.0 and implementing -h and -?) for
	  bw-d.c and d-bw.c

2013-06-07 14:34  carlmoore

	* [r55687] src/sig/f-i.c, src/sig/i-f.c:
	  set scale=1.0 in the declaration, not in a separate statement

2013-06-06 22:01  carlmoore

	* [r55686] src/conv/euclid/euclid_format.c:
	  remove a set of braces because the if/then has just 1 statement

2013-06-06 21:18  carlmoore

	* [r55685] doc/docbook/system/man1/en/fbclear.xml:
	  remove -h reference; notice the reference to Adage in the
	  now-deleted remark about -h

2013-06-06 20:22  carlmoore

	* [r55684] src/fb/fbclear.c:
	  remove old h (it was a high-res flag; use 's 1024' or 'S 1024)
	  and implement h,?

2013-06-06 16:14  carlmoore

	* [r55683] src/sig/f-d.c:
	  cosmetic stuff to resemble d-f.c source as much as possible

2013-06-06 15:59  brlcad

	* [r55682] src/libbrep/intersect.cpp:
	  bio.h is a system header wrapper but should still probably come
	  after the <> headers

2013-06-05 22:32  brlcad

	* [r55681] src/sig/d-f.c, src/sig/f-d.c:
	  learn from each other. scale must be initialized.

2013-06-05 20:46  carlmoore

	* [r55680] src/sig/f-d.c:
	  remove 'scale = 1.0;' because the if/else will assign a value
	  anyway

2013-06-05 18:20  n_reed

	* [r55679] src/libged/draw.c:
	  don't set autoview flag until after memset

2013-06-05 16:06  carlmoore

	* [r55678] src/conv/enf-g.c:
	  fix 'must' spelling; add progname to error messages; implement

2013-06-05 04:02  brlcad

	* [r55671] CMakeLists.txt, include/dvec.h:
	  make sure the emmintrin.h header actually works, not just exists.
	  there's a gcc bug spanning 4.0-4.5 where the posix_memalign()
	  decls are different causing a 'throws different exceptions'
	  failure

2013-06-05 03:50  starseeker

	* [r55670] include/brep.h:
	  Both the BEGIN and the END need to be inside or outside the ifdef
	  together - mixing and matching doesn't work on NetBSD.

2013-06-05 03:43  starseeker

	* [r55669] src/libbn/tri_tri.c:
	  another common.h missing

2013-06-05 03:06  brlcad

	* [r55668] src/libbu/sscanf.c:
	  by design, common.h should always come before all system headers

2013-06-04 21:54  carlmoore

	* [r55667] src/conv/dxf/dxf-g.c:

2013-06-04 21:18  brlcad

	* [r55666] src/other/togl/src/CMakeLists.txt:
	  search the provided source directories for headers before
	  searching for them in system directories. fixes a build error
	  encountered on a system where the system-installed glew.h was too
	  old to be used. warrants a header compatibility test if we

	  first.

2013-06-04 20:28  carlmoore

	* [r55665] src/sig/dwin.c:
	  implement -h and -? for help, specify usage of files (not

2013-06-04 20:05  starseeker

	* [r55664] misc/CMake/FindGL.cmake:

2013-06-04 11:37  brlcad

	* [r55657] CMakeLists.txt:
	  thanks netbsd 5 ... they partially implemented TLS support so it
	  compiles and links, but will simply crash at runtime. (gives
	  __tls_get_addr() runtime link failure on library linkage) change
	  the test to also run the test, not just compile it for the
	  __thread test only to catch this failure. pthread fallback should
	  hopefully still work.

	  more ctype argument type cleansing

2013-06-04 06:05  brlcad

	* [r55655] CMakeLists.txt:
	  manually wrap a couple simple tests since both
	  CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS and CHECK_PROTOTYPE_EXISTS appear to be
	  completely unusable for testing header declarations. deserves a
	  macro in the meantime, but the issue has been reported.

2013-06-04 05:30  brlcad

	* [r55654] CMakeLists.txt:
	  so CHECK_PROTOTYPE_EXISTS() is woefully busted in numerous ways.
	  assumes c++, has a bad symbol test, results in unused var
	  warnings, and doesn't work with preprocessor-wrapped symbols
	  coming from system headers. former versions of
	  CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS() almost did exactly what we need (a simple
	  (void)symbol; test just like AC_CHECK_DECL) but was bastardized
	  in recent versions so it now spews an error too (it's busted and
	  has been reported).

	* [r55649] misc/CMake/CompilerFlags.cmake:
	  revert r54119 by caen23 that made debug compilation also use
	  gnu99 instead of gnu89. as noted in the preceding comment, we
	  intentionally compile with both to provoke more warnings. need
	  more info on the clang failures.

2013-06-04 03:38  brlcad

	* [r55648] src/libbu/units.c:
	  the ctype functions technically take an 'int' derived from an
	  unsigned char, so netbsd is appropriately warning about the
	  danger passing a signed char. we know these are strings, so
	  casting to unsigned char is sufficient to quell.

2013-06-04 03:24  brlcad

	* [r55647] src/libbu/backtrace.c:
	  hook off of the configure tests so we don't get duplciate
	  declarations when the posix kill() and fileno() functions are
	  available.

2013-06-04 03:16  brlcad

	* [r55646] include/config_win_cmake.h.in:
	  ditto, we have fileno()

2013-06-04 03:12  brlcad

	* [r55645] include/config_win.h:
	  windows has fileno() (because we define it to _fileno()), and
	  there aren't c99 declaration issues because msvc doesn't give a
	  hoot about it.

2013-06-04 03:10  brlcad

	* [r55644] src/libbn/plane.c:
	  need stdlib.h for modf() and nextafter() but remove the long
	  double support since it requires build system infrastructure.
	  several relatively common platforms (some not so common, some
	  common) don't support long doubles. (gnulib quotes FreeBSD 6.0,
	  NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, Minix 3.1.8, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, Solaris
	  9, Cygwin, Interix 3.5) moreover, we'd need other changes to make
	  fastf_t be more than single or double precision.

2013-06-04 02:38  brlcad

	* [r55643] CMakeLists.txt:
	  test for fileno() since the function disappears in c99 pedantic

	  fileno() being declared.

2013-06-03 19:07  brlcad

2013-06-02 02:59  brlcad

	* [r55633] include/brep.h:
	  reminded of some instanity in the C standard that has comments
	  parsed in phase 3 BEFORE the preprocessor (phase 4) so even #if 0
	  // comments being compiled in -pedantic mode will cause gcc to
	  issue a warning. it's a silly unhelpful interpretation by the gcc
	  devs (that a warning needs to be issued in phase 3 just because
	  it's a comment issue even if the comment is in code hidden by the
	  pre-processor. at least accommodating the silly is simple.

	* [r55630] NEWS:
	  still need to quantify this change (r55618), but in theory it'll

	  richard fixed the FIXME in the file that talks about the

	  surface tree presently only carves up the surface based on 3d
	  flatness criteria, but the EHY provided a case where the surface
	  is substantially flat but has huge non-linear uv domain
	  curvature. the fix for now was to be a little more careful about
	  walking and trying a little harder to find the surface point
	  before giving up. this makes the walk slightly slower but more
	  robust too. long term may be to make the surface tree also (or

	* [r55338] src/librt/primitives/brep/brep.cpp:
	  Newton iterator wasn't converging to a solution for the EHY
	  primitive converted to a BREP. The inverse jacobian was causing
	  the iterator to jump to a solution that was farther away than the
	  current point. Added a better half-step of the UV deltas until a
	  closer solution is found. Will half-step up to 1000 iterations
	  before bailing on the shotline. Need to look at the surface to
	  see why its causing such large steps but is a fix in the near
	  term. This was turned up by Richard Weiss while testing 'rtarea'
	  results from BREP conversions of our implicits.

2013-05-08 18:04  indianlarry

	* [r55337] src/librt/shoot.c:
	  The non-uniform binary space partitioning tree used to partition
	  solids into RPP cells within librt to speed raytracing was using
	  an absolute "nudge" value to walk/step the ray into the next
	  partition cell. In certain circumstances the "nudge" value was
	  causing grazing cell hits to walk over thin intersections even
	  when these intgersections were greater than the thinness
	  tolerance. This update modified this code to use our distance
	  tolerance instead. Now our distance tolerance default or a user
	  specified value can be used. This was turned up by Richard Weiss
	  while testing 'rtarea' results from BREP conversions of our
	  implicits.

	  Copy-pasted bodies of Create member functions added a heap object
	  to a map, and then deleted the object if loading failed.
	  Supposing the object was deleted, later reference to it via the
	  map caused a segfault. The simple fix was complicated by the
	  number of instances that had to be fixed, so the duplicated logic
	  has been pulled into a static member of the parent STEPEntity
	  class, and the subclass Create members now just call that
	  function, passing the variable elements, namely their class name
	  and a newly added GetInstance function that returns a new
	  instance of the class.

	  previous commit log message for all the nitty gritty detais.
	  basically had to update the ordering now that they match the
	  change in 7.14.6 to make the rpp vertices match arb8.

2013-04-05 14:51  brlcad

	* [r55065] doc/docbook/lessons/en/mged15_creating_a_toy_truck.xml:
	  update the inside command parameters to match the new rpp vertex
	  behavior that was made to match the ordering of an arb8 in 7.14.6
	  (r33973). the "right" parameters were ironically the ones already
	  documented in a note when the lessons were written up in 2001 as
	  having changed. tracing back through the commit history, it looks
	  like this however was entirely unintentional (i.e., it was a bug)
	  that was documented here instead of getting fixed.

	  what had happened: circa 1985 (r373) 'in' command directly
	  implemented rpp (matching arb8), circa 1987 (r1518) wdb rpp
	  routine added (with "natural origin" but not matching arb8),
	  circa 2000 (r18885) 'in' command updated to use libwdb
	  (inadvertently changing the order), circa 2009 (r33973) wdb
	  routine finally fixed to match arb8, and now the doc finally gets
	  fixed to match. so there ya have it, took three devs scratching
	  heads for a day to figure this all out.

	  left a note on how to verify the right values ('l' command so as
	  to not rely on graphical inspection) and the old command so the
	  docs will still work with older releases.

	  duh, race condition on initializing the per-cpu structure
	  dynamically. statically allocate for the compile-time maximum

2013-04-04 05:05  brlcad

	* [r55041] NEWS:
	  bob added a new way to edit matrices in archer that mged does not
	  support in r51689, namely the ability to edit the matrix above
	  some member of a combination. to quote: Previously, mouse
	  interactions resulted in edits getting pushed into the selected
	  object. That is if the selected object was a combination, the
	  edits wound up as matrices above all members in the combination.
	  And if the selected object was a primitive, the edits were pushed
	  into the primitive. Archer has another mode button in the toolbar
	  for deciding how mouse interactions are applied to the select
	  object.

2013-04-04 02:56  brlcad

	* [r55031] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  provide a LIBBU_AFFINITY environment variable to allow run-time

2013-04-03 14:02  carlmoore

	* [r55028] src/anim/chan_add.c, src/anim/chan_mult.c:
	  stdio.h removed because of bio.h

2013-04-03 11:41  bob1961

	* [r55027] src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Modify ArcherCore::cp to draw and select the new object.

2013-04-03 06:42  brlcad

	* [r55026] src/libbu/thread.cpp:

2013-04-03 06:24  brlcad

	* [r55025] src/libbu/thread.cpp:
	  use the better new names for detected TLS support

2013-04-03 06:24  brlcad

	* [r55024] CMakeLists.txt:
	  BRLCAD_TYPE_SIZE() and the built-in CMAKE_CHECK_TYPE() macros are
	  no good for this purpose since they try to sizeof(). instead,
	  just try compiling a small custom snippet.

2013-04-03 06:04  brlcad

	  bump RT_DBNHASH up to the next power of two instead of 5120 and
	  document the heck out of it as a deprecated interface. include
	  memory usage calculations (64kb). the increase from 1024 should
	  slow down all of the callers that manually iterate over the hash
	  (prep, search, db open/lookup, push, tops, ls, ...) but probably
	  not noticeably so -- more likely to slow lookups down iterating
	  down bigger linked lists with big geometry (need to
	  profile/test/compare).

	  need to test this theory, but we shouldn't need to look up the
	  current affinity mask to set a cpu preference. bu_parallel_id()
	  modded with the number of avail cpus should set all threads with
	  the appropriate affinity mask.

2013-03-29 16:46  brlcad

	* [r54969] src/libbu/affinity.c:
	  stub in an implementation of thread affinity for mac os x, to the
	  extent that mac supports the notion. they don't really do
	  affinity, but will let you group/ungroup threads to
	  help/discourage cache sharing. here we put every thread into
	  their own group so the default affinity scheduling should help
	  minimize cpu movement.

	* [r54968] src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl,

	  Update the Command widgets invoke method to store the actual
	  command the was executed (i.e., this command may be one that gets
	  built up by the more-args mechanism that prompts the user for

	  the example is once again correct. Will fix the double-quote
	  issue on the Tcl side.

2013-03-29 05:53  brlcad

	* [r54964] src/libged/tables.c:
	  fastf_t arrays need a little more const persuasion

2013-03-29 05:51  brlcad

	* [r54963] src/libged/tables.c:
	  pass const

2013-03-29 05:49  brlcad

	* [r54962] src/libbu/affinity.c:
	  just because we have pthreads doesn't mean we have the cpuset
	  macros, e.g., mac os x.

2013-03-29 05:26  brlcad

	* [r54961] src/libbu/affinity.c:
	  expand support to freebsd, just a few changes needed

2013-03-29 05:22  brlcad

	* [r54960] CMakeLists.txt:
	  need to check for a few headers to support thread affinity on
	  bsd. check for pthread_np.h and sys/cpuset.h headers along with
	  the cpu_set_t type (which is linux, bsd is cpuset_t but allegedly
	  may switch to match).

2013-03-29 04:56  brlcad

	* [r54959] src/libged/tables.c:
	  quellage, go through libbu and a vls to print size_t values to
	  file.

2013-03-29 04:54  brlcad

	* [r54958] src/libbu/affinity.c:
	  need to explore the portability of this, but go ahead and locally
	  override the _GNU_SOURCE setting so that we can enable processor
	  affinity for pthread systems. after much headache, figured out
	  that _GNU_SOURCE needs to be defined before the common.h header.
	  common includes some system headers and the features.h header is
	  only going to get read once to set the necessary __USE_GNU define
	  and declaring the CPU_* macros and pthread affinity funcs the
	  implementation uses. this is going to jack up linux benchmarks,
	  but it's a nice 5-50% improvement on even small smp systems.

2013-03-29 03:28  brlcad

	* [r54957] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg.c:
	  quell warning about preserving constness to a matp_t parameter by
	  casting _before_ passing.

2013-03-29 03:21  brlcad

	* [r54956] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg.c:
	  rt_nmg_import4_fastf takes a const matp_t

2013-03-29 03:16  brlcad

	* [r54955] src/librt/primitives/arb8/arb8.c:
	  ws indent style cleanup

2013-03-29 03:14  brlcad

	* [r54954] src/librt/primitives/arb8/arb8.c:
	  quell gcc false positive due to the parameter getting set within
	  the expression. initialize explicitly for good measure anyways.

2013-03-29 02:47  brlcad

	* [r54953] src/util/bwcrop.c:
	  need signed comparison now to match buflines

2013-03-29 02:35  brlcad

	* [r54952] src/librt/primitives/bot/tie_kdtree.c:
	  bu_log supports %zu for size_t

2013-03-28 20:20  carlmoore

	* [r54951] src/librt/primitives/bot/tie_kdtree.c:
	  fix warning about format designator

2013-03-28 19:59  carlmoore

	* [r54950] src/mged/cad_boundp.c:
	  provide Usage based on the man page, but the program is allowed
	  to continue running

2013-03-28 19:48  carlmoore

	* [r54949] src/anim/chan_permute.c:
	  oops, also put in the correct command name in these error
	  messages

2013-03-28 19:45  carlmoore

	* [r54948] src/anim/chan_permute.c:
	  modify messages for can't open

2013-03-28 18:04  brlcad

	* [r54947] misc/CMake/BRLCAD_CompilerFlags.cmake:
	  there are far too many unquellable false-positive inline warnings
	  with more recent versions of gcc (4.7ish) where it warns about
	  not being able to inline default constructors and desctructors
	  that it created and that we cannot quell with the given inline
	  hooks. so turn them all off (for C++) for now

2013-03-28 17:49  brlcad

	* [r54946] src/other/CMakeLists.txt:
	  revert back to ignoring the boost subdir

2013-03-28 17:49  brlcad

	* [r54945] src/libbu/CMakeLists.txt, src/libbu/thread.cpp:
	  upon closer inspection, it looks like boost just did exactly what
	  I had originally planned to do anyways, namely calling the
	  pthread and win32 TLS api, so strip out the boost hooks. it's not
	  worth having the additional compilation complexity to get
	  boost_thread compiling cleanly and the major third-party dep it
	  would be adding to libbu. we can just do our own thing here in
	  far far fewer lines of code, far less integration complexity.

2013-03-28 17:45  brlcad

	* [r54944] src/libpc/CMakeLists.txt:
	  since we can't seem to do a damn thing about the inline warnings,
	  turn them off outright

2013-03-28 17:37  brlcad

	* [r54943] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  hindsight consideration, don't pretend we'd ever be able to talk
	  to 'thread' 0 since it's going to be sitting there waiting for
	  the invoked threads to finish. kinda like execl. so number them 0
	  to ncpu-1

2013-03-28 17:34  bob1961

	* [r54942] src/libged/mater.c:
	  Get rid of "" and [] from the mater commands prompt array. This
	  breaks things when sending back to Tcl land.

2013-03-28 17:34  brlcad

	* [r54941] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  hook up to the thread local storage so bu_parallel_id() can track
	  our thread number, fix record keeping that keeps track of how
	  many started/finished

2013-03-28 15:47  bob1961

	* [r54940] src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  This fixes an issue where geometry doesn't show up in the newly
	  visible display windows that are exposed when going to multi-pane
	  mode AND display-lists are enabled.

2013-03-28 13:50  bob1961

	* [r54939] src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Added ArcherCore::freezeGUI.

2013-03-28 05:44  brlcad

	* [r54938] src/libbu/ispar.c:
	  remove the no longer compiled ispar.c, merged into parallel.c so
	  we could eliminate a global

2013-03-28 05:39  brlcad

	* [r54937] src/libbu/heap.c:
	  we now have a bu_parallel_id() that works, shift from 1-to-ncpu
	  to 0-to-ncpu-1

2013-03-28 05:36  brlcad

	* [r54936] src/libbu/CMakeLists.txt:
	  we're using it now, so compile thread.cpp and link against
	  boost_thread

2013-03-28 05:33  brlcad

	* [r54935] src/libbu/thread.cpp:
	  fix header, thread.cpp

2013-03-28 05:32  brlcad

	* [r54934] src/libbu/parallel.h, src/libbu/thread.cpp:
	  provide an initial implementation of two functions to get/set the
	  current cpu number in thread-local-storage (TLS). this
	  preliminarily uses boost threads, but will probably change to
	  minimize the complexity where we have support for intrinsic
	  compiler TLS.

2013-03-28 05:27  brlcad

	* [r54933] include/bu.h:
	  declare the new bu_parallel_id() function for returning the
	  current bu_parallel's cpu number (1 to ncpu)

2013-03-28 05:23  brlcad

	* [r54932] src/libpc/CMakeLists.txt:
	  don't turn off all warnings, just make them not be errors

2013-03-28 05:21  brlcad

	* [r54931] src/other/CMakeLists.txt:
	  build the boost_thread compiled library (although this is
	  probably temporary)

2013-03-28 05:20  brlcad

	* [r54930] src/other/boost/libs/thread/CMakeLists.txt:
	  the library name is supposed to be boost_thread

2013-03-28 04:40  brlcad

	* [r54929] src/other/boost/CMakeLists.txt:
	  smart_ptr doesn't actually have a CMakeLists.txt file to describe
	  the build

2013-03-27 22:19  r_weiss

2013-03-27 18:33  bob1961

2013-03-27 18:23  bob1961

	* [r54919] src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Minor tweak to ArcherCore::getTreeMembers.

2013-03-27 18:22  carlmoore

	  tktreectrl and tkdnd packages available in BRL-CAD. Not clear yet
	  if tkdnd is the right thing to use for tree element manipulation,
	  but it will allow for support for things like dragging and
	  dropping a .g file onto Archer to open it.

	* [r54915] src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Added a preference for the max number of members displayed in
	  Archer's tree for a combination. This prevents the GUI from
	  locking when some user wants a few hundred thousand members in a
	  single group (ttk::treeview doesn't handle this well). Also warn
	  the user when all members are not visible.

2013-03-27 13:10  brlcad

	* [r54910] src/rt/do.c:
	  remove the old cray cpulimit call, didn't do anything useful
	  anywhere else and the func is now gone

2013-03-27 04:53  brlcad

	* [r54909] src/libbu/parallel.c:

2013-03-27 04:51  brlcad

	* [r54908] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  make sure windows is consistent with stashing cpu ids from 1 to
	  ncpu too

2013-03-27 04:50  brlcad

	* [r54907] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  clean up some of the failure logging and pass the thread cpu id
	  numbers indexed from 1 to ncpu (inclusive). that way we can
	  reserve cpu 0 for the parent process/thread that is creating all
	  of the threads. stub in an initial bu_parallel_id() function to
	  get the cpu id, but just checkpointing the work in progress
	  because __thread is apparently unavailable on Mac OS X.

2013-03-27 04:18  brlcad

	* [r54906] CHANGES, include/bu.h, src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  remove bu_cpulimit_get() and bu_cpulimit_set() as a minimally
	  impacting change since they've also pretty much done nothing for
	  a couple decades.

2013-03-27 04:14  brlcad

	* [r54905] CHANGES, include/bu.h:
	  deprecated to obsolete: remove declarations for bu_fopen_uniq()
	  and bu_get_public_cpus()

	  src/librt/roots.c, src/librt/timer42.c, src/rt/do.c,
	  src/util/ttcp.c:
	  remove support for platforms that are no longer even remotely
	  accessible (sgi arguably is, but we should still compile there
	  with gcc). remove accommodations and references to cray,
	  sgi/irix, and alliant

2013-03-27 02:30  brlcad

	* [r54900] include/bu.h:
	  remove support for cray, irix/sgi, convex, and ultrix. highly
	  dependent on the compiler and makes the define seem to be much
	  more complicated than it really is.

2013-03-27 02:29  brlcad

	* [r54899] include/orle.h:
	  convex is long gone

2013-03-27 02:11  brlcad

	* [r54898] include/bu.h:
	  declare the new bu_semaphore.free() function.

2013-03-27 02:11  brlcad

	* [r54897] src/libbu/semaphore.c:
	  do the same for semaphore support, remove the antiquated
	  platforms (sgi, ardent, alliant, convex, cray, n16). make
	  bu_semaphore_free() a thing too, instead of just an idea for
	  releasing memory.

2013-03-27 02:03  brlcad

	* [r54896] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  since the interface is getting updates, same obsolescence holds
	  true for our old cray, alliant, convex, ardent, and encore
	  multimax

2013-03-27 01:58  brlcad

	* [r54895] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  remove parallel support for SGI IRIX since it's a gone platform
	  and keeping it here has become a maintenance burden (having to
	  maintain and needing to improve/change a threading impl that
	  cannot be tested)

2013-03-27 01:45  brlcad

	* [r54894] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  consistency, use arrow instead of parendotting

2013-03-27 01:28  brlcad

	* [r54893] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  rename bu_pid_of_initiating_thread to not have the bu_ prefix
	  since it's not a published global. make it static too to limit
	  scope.

2013-03-27 01:22  brlcad

	* [r54892] src/libbu/CMakeLists.txt, src/libbu/Makefile.am,
	  src/libbu/globals.c, src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  collapse ispar.c into parallel.c even though we want to prefer
	  smaller files. ispar was a bad non-descript name to begin with
	  and the two functions it provides are weak. more importantly, the
	  access a global that we can make static if we consolidate it to
	  parallel.c

2013-03-26 20:42  brlcad

	* [r54891] src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  clean up the array indexing, inconsistently unconventional

2013-03-26 20:38  brlcad

	* [r54890] include/bu.h, src/libbu/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/libbu/Makefile.am, src/libbu/affinity.c,
	  src/libbu/parallel.c, src/libbu/parallel.h:
	  bu_set_affinity() doesn't need to be public API if we call it on
	  all bu_parallel() threads for the user. it becomes an
	  implementation detail. rename to parallel_set_affinity(), update
	  accordingly to depublish, and add to old build.

2013-03-26 20:26  brlcad

	* [r54889] include/bu.h, src/libbu/affinity.c:
	  move comments from source to header, remove unhelpful file
	  comment, include common.h before system headers

2013-03-26 20:24  brlcad

	* [r54888] src/libbu/affinity.c:
	  ws style comment cleanup

2013-03-26 20:18  brlcad

	* [r54887] include/bu.h, src/libbu/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/libbu/affinity.c, src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  apply skriptkid's (akshay kashyap's) gci patch
	  (http://www.google-melange.com/gci/task/view/google/gci2012/8070202)
	  that implements cpu thread affinity. initial testing showed a
	  HUGE impact on massively parallel systems with one 64-core ibm
	  power7 system showing a benchmark performance improvement around
	  50% (VGR increase from 120k to 180k). currently only implemented
	  for pthread systems, but should be easily extended to other
	  platforms and gives bu_parallel() some initial infrastructure so
	  bu_parallel threads can know their CPU id. very cool.

2013-03-26 19:25  brlcad

	* [r54886] src/libbu/heap.c:
	  implement a per-cpu data structure so that we can support
	  multithreaded memory requests without pooching our data and
	  without needing to acquire a performance-killer semaphore lock.
	  restructure the bin data into a single struct container which
	  should give better data coherence as well (but need to verify).

2013-03-26 18:59  carlmoore

	* [r54885] src/util/pixfilter.c:
	  touchup so that pixfilter.c resembles, as close as possible,
	  bwfilter.c .

2013-03-26 17:36  bob1961

	* [r54884] src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  ArcherCore::getTreeMembers is no longer recursive.

	* [r54881] src/other/step/cmake/Generated_Source_Utils.cmake,
	  src/other/step/src/express/generated/verification_info.cmake:
	  if we only strip evil carriage returns, we can use md5sum on the
	  file directly to verify and update them.

2013-03-26 15:16  brlcad

	* [r54880] src/other/lemon/lempar.c:
	  set the initial dynamic allocation to 256 for better memory
	  alignment and doubling in powers of two

2013-03-26 15:15  brlcad

	* [r54879] src/other/step/src/express/expparse.y,
	  src/other/step/src/express/generated/expparse.c:
	  looks like a stack size of 0 means grow dynamically on the heap
	  instead of static allocation. array is going to be faster, but
	  it's more critical to not hit a compile-time limit. by default,
	  grow the dynamic allocation from 256 in powers of two.

2013-03-26 15:01  n_reed

	* [r54878] src/other/step/src/fedex_plus/classes.c:
	  put attrFlags declarations in preprocessor conditionals to match
	  wrapped uses; avoids unused variable warnings

2013-03-26 14:58  r_weiss

	* [r54877] src/other/tk/win/wish.exe.manifest:
	  This file is needed for windows to build.

	  src/other/step/src/fedex_plus/classes_wrapper.cc,
	  src/other/step/src/fedex_plus/multpass.c,
	  src/other/step/src/fedex_plus/selects.c:
	  Facilitate merge work by removing the const_ typedef return types
	  introducded in r49683. It's not clear that returned values need
	  const qualification, or that they are assigned to lvalues that
	  preserve that qualification, so these const_ types are presently
	  an elaborate way to accomplish nothing, and moreover have caused
	  issues parsing some express inputs. Until someone can
	  authoritatively determine what values should and should-not be
	  considered read-only, we'll take a much simpler approach to
	  suppressing misued qualifier warnings by just omitting the
	  erroneous application of const to generated return types.

2013-03-26 14:22  brlcad

	* [r54875] src/util/pix-png.c:
	  undo apparent accidental inclusion of pix-png.c in r54858. it
	  made help options not work (and incorrectly spits an error about
	  not outputting to a tty).

2013-03-26 14:13  n_reed

	* [r54874] src/libged/draw.c:

	* [r54871] include/bu.h:
	  rt_avail_cpus() was renamed to bu_avail_cpus() a long time ago,
	  update comment along with bu_hist_range()

2013-03-26 03:31  brlcad

	* [r54870] include/conf/PATCH:
	  significant third-party updates, bump patch to keep track

2013-03-26 03:04  brlcad

	* [r54869] src/libbu/heap.c:
	  support a wider range of allocation request sizes (1-1024) but
	  keep page sizes at 1MB per size. add the ability to bomb on
	  out-of-range requests so they can be traced.

2013-03-26 02:49  brlcad

	* [r54868] src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	  not just rare but unlikely that there are thousands of light
	  sources, so let them be allocated on the system heap. pretty big
	  struct (295 bytes)

2013-03-26 02:16  brlcad

	* [r54867] src/libbu/heap.c:
	  make the debug printing conditional on bu_debug being set to
	  something

2013-03-26 01:40  brlcad

	* [r54866] src/mged/mged.c:
	  restore stdout and stderr when we're done with the GUI by
	  capturing them with a dup() call and then later restoring back
	  with dup2(). this fixes a problem where an atexit() callback
	  couldn't write out anything during shutdown (SIGPIPE) because Tcl
	  had destroyed the channel we set up. document and descope a
	  couple of the globals while we're at it. untested, but this
	  should work fine on windows as well because dup/dup2 are c89 and
	  msdn-supported. begging for some _WIN32 cleanup consolidation
	  (the duplication seems unnecessary).

2013-03-26 00:22  brlcad

	* [r54865] src/mged/mged.c:
	  slow commit, wasn't supposed to get this yet

	* [r54862] src/mged/mged.h:
	  declare gui_output

2013-03-26 00:11  brlcad

	* [r54861] src/mged/mged.c:
	  remove the debug printing to the non-portable /tmp/stdout file,
	  makes several bogus assumptions. also be sure to remove our
	  bu_log hook that redirects output to the GUI when we're closing
	  the application. there may be other calls to bu_log() that will
	  crash after Tcl is shut down.

2013-03-25 21:41  carlmoore

	* [r54860] src/util/bw-rle.c:

	  src/other/step/src/express/generated/expparse.c,
	  src/other/step/src/express/generated/verification_info.cmake:
	  Parsing 242_n2813_mim_lf.exp exceeds lemon's max stack depth. The
	  quick fix is to double the stack size to 200, which incidentally
	  is bison's initial stack size.

	* [r54851] regress/solidspix.asc, src/libbn/poly.c:
	  restore the increased M_SQRT3 precision change that carl had made
	  to the polynomial root solver, which broke the solids regression
	  test. walking the math through the debugger showed that a
	  slightly different root was being returned causing a ray to
	  intersect the massively distorted eto in the solids regression at
	  enough of a delta to cause different light computations. this
	  resulted in a single pixel off-by-many, which we also update in
	  the reference image so that it reflects the new more accurate
	  answer. while we're at it, increase the precision of 1/3 and
	  1/27th by computing them during static init.

	  convert all of the vmath block macros to do {} while (0) form so
	  that a semicolon becomes required. only a really stupid compiler
	  would actually output an always-false branch test, so it should
	  have no impact on performance. moreover, testing (mac, linux,
	  gcc, clang) showed no impact.

2013-03-22 13:22  brlcad

	* [r54820] src/liboptical/sh_cloud.c:
	  revert 54485 since the added precision introduces lots of
	  benchmark result off-by-many changes. the low precision .707
	  value has been there since Version 2 of RT (commit 395 in Aug
	  1985). a case for updating the benchmarks could be made, but the
	  sensitivity possibly introduced by the double-precision value is
	  concerning (will single-precision fastf_t give same values?)

	  TkTreeCtrl (http://tktreectrl.sourceforge.net) is a better, more
	  powerful tree widget than the default ttk widget - there's a
	  decent chance Archer will be making use of this, so checkpointing
	  the CMake build for it. Will revert until there is a need, but
	  don't want to lose the working CMake build. As a first step,
	  commit the vanilla sources for a diffing baseline.

2013-03-21 20:46  carlmoore

	* [r54813] src/util/pix-png.c:
	  reverted r54804 because we need to accept piped input too

2013-03-21 20:31  brlcad

	* [r54812] src/librt/primitives/bspline/nurb_ray.c,
	  src/librt/primitives/ell/ell.c:
	  and more missing semicolons, clean up resulting indent failures

2013-03-21 20:29  starseeker

	* [r54811] configure.ac:
	  Add lodUtilityP Makefile to configure.ac

2013-03-21 20:29  brlcad

	* [r54810] src/conv/euclid/euclid_unformat.c,
	  src/librt/primitives/arb8/arb8.c:
	  more semicolons missing from vmath macros

2013-03-21 20:14  starseeker

	* [r54809] misc/CMake/distcheck_repo_verify.cmake.in:
	  Fix a couple bugs in the repository verification - build files
	  reporting in ignored directories wasn't respecting the SVN
	  deleted flag, and the REGEX for stripping the deleted marker from
	  an svn report line was too aggressive.

2013-03-21 20:09  brlcad

	* [r54808] src/libbn/tcl.c:
	  missing semi

2013-03-21 19:39  brlcad

	* [r54807] include/vmath.h:
	  implement macros for swapping vectors and matrices. use a single
	  temporary float for the vectors, but a full temp matrix for the
	  matrix swap. while the single fastf_t temp is fewer read/write
	  instructions, it may be more coherent (faster) to use a full
	  vector. warrants testing if put into critical code. implemented
	  in do{}while(0) fashion so a semicolon becomes necessary

2013-03-21 19:21  brlcad

	* [r54806] src/librt/primitives/tgc/tgc.c:
	  bah, pay attention to our order. don't use before we declare.
	  make two of the globals static to limit scope

2013-03-21 19:17  brlcad

	* [r54805] src/librt/primitives/tgc/tgc.c:
	  move definitions and globals around, push them to the top of the
	  file and group together

2013-03-21 19:15  carlmoore

	* [r54804] src/util/pix-png.c:
	  and I added this so we can have the run-with-no-arguments
	  construct without extra error (cannot input from tty)

2013-03-21 18:53  brlcad

	* [r54803] src/liboptical/sh_toyota.c:
	  comment cleanup

2013-03-21 18:49  starseeker

	* [r54802] src/other/CMakeLists.txt:
	  Add the tk unix path to the list of internal header paths used to
	  build tcl/tk extensions. This may fix the togl build failure with
	  tcl/tk 8.5.13, but is untested - see
	  http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/svn-ports-all/2012-September/003483.html

2013-03-21 18:37  carlmoore

	* [r54801] src/util/pix-png.c:
	  Usage statement was missing reference to -g gamma

2013-03-21 18:09  brlcad

	* [r54800] include/bu.h:
	  document that the new stat/seek functions should not yet be
	  considered new API since there may be a less intrusive option.
	  don't want to be considered published.

2013-03-21 16:43  jordisayol

	  mass conversion of nearly all the 2277 instances of bu_malloc()
	  and bu_calloc() where there were single structure allocations to
	  BU_ALLOC(). this has the main benefit of brevity, helping with
	  maintainability and readability. it reduced 20k chars and
	  eliminated over 1.5 lines (same # statements, they just tended to
	  span multiple lines because they were so wordy). about 500
	  instances are converted. the one logical change is that
	  BU_ALLOC() ensures zero-initialization via bu_calloc() and that
	  should generally be a good thing for structures, maybe even fix
	  an obscure bug or two.

	  helped a navy user (roles) with a fastgen patch file conversion
	  that uncovered a variety of issues that have been improved upon
	  in patch-g. the tool would cryptically fail if the file wasn't
	  (unnecessarily) read/write. it also had numerous hard-coded
	  limits (like 500 materials, 1500 of this, 1000 of that) that
	  would cause memory corruption and cascading bad behavior. limits
	  increased nearly two orders of magnitude, but still hard-coded
	  for now since that requires a lot more data and testing to
	  implement safely.

	  turns out r54203 was removing files that opennurbs removed, so I
	  was wrong about them needing to be added to the build logic
	  (something fishy, they were in my earlier version of
	  2012-10-24...). there were other unsyncd files to be added and
	  removed, though, and this gets them in sync. notably updates
	  their msvc and xcode build files (which we do not use), removes
	  example_dump and their massprop code. intentionally keeps the
	  now-deleted opennurbs_x (surface surface intersection!),
	  openurbs_brep_kinky (surface cleanup), opennurbs_brep_changesrf
	  (surface conversion), and opennurbs_based (succinctly identifies
	  RhinoSDK removals!).

	* [r54575] src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Added "Save as png ..." menu items to the display menus.

2013-03-08 17:03  brlcad

	* [r54574] include/bu.h:
	  gah, need to wrap the multi-statement form of BU_PUT in curlies
	  or unwrapped if(null) tests will still run the free

	  files that were added to opennurbs instead of adding them to our
	  build logic. fix to build and distcheck coming up next.

2013-03-08 16:06  brlcad

	* [r54572] NEWS:
	  richard updated openNURBS from the 2010 sources to the newest
	  2012-10-24 release (still v5.0).

2013-03-08 15:51  brlcad

	* [r54571] include/bu.h, src/libbu/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/libbu/Makefile.am, src/libbu/pool.c:
	  undeclare and remove the bu_pool routines

2013-03-08 15:47  brlcad

	* [r54570] include/bu.h:
	  stub in calls to the new bu_heap get/put API underneath
	  BU_GET/BU_PUT, but do not enable for the time being because all
	  of the existing BU_GET calls need to be reviewed to be either
	  paired with BU_PUT or converted to BU_ALLOC.

2013-03-08 15:44  brlcad

	* [r54569] include/nmg.h:
	  remove the bu_pool hooks now in dead #if 0 sections. also
	  simplify NMG_FREESTRUCT() .. BU_PUT() already zero's the data and
	  pointer.

2013-03-08 15:38  brlcad

	* [r54568] include/nmg.h, src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_copy.c:
	  undo the usage of richard's pooling memory interface underneath
	  NMG. direct profiling of the implementation showed it to be an
	  order of magnitude slower than bu_malloc/calloc, 50M allocations
	  went from 5s to 70s-90s.

2013-03-08 15:32  brlcad

	* [r54567] src/libbu/heap.c:
	  increase the range of supported allocations from 1-256 and
	  1MB-sized pages. minor overhead to support an even bigger range,
	  but pagesize should probably not exceed 1MB. report additional
	  stats on the number of hits (allocations in range) and misses
	  (out of range size).

2013-03-08 14:57  bob1961

	* [r54566] src/archer/archer, src/libtclcad/tclcad_obj.c:
	  Dynamically set the brlcad version in Archer's title bar.

	* [r54565] src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Added Copy/Paste/Kill/Killall/Rename functionality to Archer's
	  tree menu.

2013-03-08 04:56  brlcad

	* [r54562] include/bu.h:
	  declare and document the new bu_heap_get() and bu_heap_put()
	  functions.

2013-03-07 22:43  starseeker

	* [r54560] src/librt/primitives/bot/bot.c:

2013-03-07 19:01  brlcad

	* [r54559] src/librt/cut.c:
	  pair BU_PUT with BU_GET for cut nodes

2013-03-07 18:35  n_reed

	* [r54558] src/librt/primitives/tgc/tgc.c:
	  handle recs specially to reduce calls to cos/sin

2013-03-07 18:31  n_reed

	* [r54557] src/other/libvds/build.c:
	  disable calculation of node bounds

2013-03-07 17:55  r_weiss

	* [r54556] src/libged/analyze.c:
	  Fixed ADD_PT macro in libged "analyze.c". This prevents a seg
	  fault when running analyze on an ARB8.

2013-03-07 06:27  brlcad

	* [r54555] misc/CMake/distcheck_autotools.cmake.in:
	  ditto, add enable-png-build to distcheck-all target since it's no
	  longer default

2013-03-07 06:27  brlcad

	* [r54554] Makefile.am:
	  enable the png build all the time for distcheck since it's now
	  off even with enable-all

2013-03-07 05:36  brlcad

	* [r54553] src/adrt/load_g.c:
	  gah, fix trailing quote comment typo

2013-03-07 05:22  brlcad

	* [r54552] src/librt/wdb.c:
	  call BU_ALLOC() instead of BU_GET() since this is a pretty
	  big/infrequently allocated structure

2013-03-07 05:18  brlcad

	* [r54551] include/bu.h:
	  expand docs on how BU_GET()+BU_PUT() are supposed to be used, add
	  new BU_ALLOC() convenience macro that basically is the same as
	  the old BU_GETSTRUCT() macro without being specific to structs --
	  it just saves some of the typing repetition when allocating a
	  single struct. most of the existing BU_GET() calls will get
	  converted to BU_ALLOC() unless a BU_PUT() pairing is
	  obvious/trivial or if it's performance-critical code.

2013-03-07 03:05  brlcad

	* [r54550] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_fuse.c:
	  NMG allocations are wrapped in get/put allocations, so release
	  with put, not with bu_free

2013-03-07 02:56  brlcad

	* [r54549] src/librt/comb/comb.c:
	  call malloc instead of get for now since the latter needs to be
	  paired with BU_PUT calls

2013-03-07 02:53  brlcad

	* [r54548] src/adrt/load_g.c:
	  note that this memory doesn't seem(?) to be released

2013-03-07 00:54  brlcad

	* [r54547] include/solid.h:
	  call bu_calloc() instead of BU_GET() since the caller doesn't
	  know.

2013-03-06 22:37  brlcad

	* [r54546] CHANGES:
	  deprecate RT_GET_TREE() and RT_FREE_TREE(). probably minimally
	  impacting, but needs some review/testing so just scheduled

2013-03-06 22:32  brlcad

	* [r54545] include/raytrace.h:
	  the motivation for RT_GET_TREE()/RT_FREE_TREE() and keeping a
	  free list in the resource structure may be moot or at least
	  unnecessary now, but warrants performance testing

2013-03-06 22:27  brlcad

	* [r54544] src/libbu/CMakeLists.txt, src/libbu/Makefile.am:
	  add new heap.c for compilation

2013-03-06 22:24  brlcad

	* [r54543] src/libbu/heap.c:
	  stub in an initial implementation of a really fast heap-based
	  memory allocation capability for small allocation sizes. it
	  allocates size-designated blocks of memory ('pages') in order to
	  substantially reduce calls to system malloc. it has a nice
	  property of being O(1) on alloc and profiles substantially faster
	  than system malloc. from half to several orders of magnitude in
	  testing (making the call cost near-zero). presently only
	  implemented for byte sizes 1 through 64 (trivial to extend).
	  implementation of free is stubbed empty, but intend to reuse free
	  cells and reclaim memory on-demand. made to match BU_GET/BU_PUT
	  so it can serve as the back-end implementation.

2013-03-06 22:02  brlcad

	* [r54542] include/nmg.h:
	  cast makes for an invalid lvalue, remove it

2013-03-06 22:02  brlcad

	* [r54541] include/nurb.h:
	  call bu_calloc instead of BU_GET since we don't call the
	  corresponding BU_PUT

2013-03-06 21:47  carlmoore

	* [r54540] src/util/bw3-pix.c:
	  use capital U

2013-03-06 20:57  brlcad

	* [r54539] src/libged/ged.c:
	  match BU_PUT() to BU_GET() allocation

2013-03-06 20:49  brlcad

	* [r54538] include/nmg.h:
	  BU_PUT() to match BU_GET()

2013-03-06 20:47  brlcad

	* [r54537] include/bu.h:
	  examples should do what the api docs say, if we call BU_GET()
	  then we should call BU_PUT() ... not bu_free().

2013-03-06 19:54  brlcad

	* [r54536] src/librt/db5_io.c, src/librt/db5_scan.c:
	  remove the pooling on geometry objects at the IO layer. testing
	  of the pooling calls indicated performance was substantially
	  slower than system malloc/free (by an order of magnitude).

2013-03-06 17:33  carlmoore

	* [r54535] src/fb/bw-fb.c:
	  insert space before a left parenthesis

2013-03-06 16:51  brlcad

	* [r54534] src/other/tcl/CMakeLists.txt:
	  shouldn't be compiling tclAppInit into libtcl -- it contains a
	  main() intended for front end clients like tclsh

2013-03-05 18:32  n_reed

	* [r54533] src/libtclcad/tclcad_obj.c:
	  have archer redraw after interactive zoom when doing adaptive
	  plotting

2013-03-05 15:44  n_reed

	* [r54532] src/libged/draw.c:

	* [r54530] src/other/poly2tri/poly2tri/sweep/advancing_front.h,
	  src/other/poly2tri/poly2tri/sweep/sweep.cc,
	  src/other/poly2tri/poly2tri/sweep/sweep.h:
	  Determine circumcircle during sweep adding event to close points
	  when height of circumcircle is reached. Current methodology was
	  solely using angles between neighbors on the advancing front
	  occasionally causing non-conforming triangles to be formed.

2013-03-04 22:30  carlmoore

	* [r54529] src/anim/chan_permute.c:
	  avoid error messages and *bomb.log file, and instead print Usage

2013-03-04 17:28  indianlarry

	* [r54528] src/other/poly2tri/poly2tri/sweep/sweep_context.cc,
	  src/other/poly2tri/poly2tri/sweep/sweep_context.h:
	  Added function AddPointCheckForDuplicates() to class SweepContext
	  to extend the package to check for duplicates in both the
	  constrained polygon inputs (SweepContext(std::vector<Point*>
	  &polyline) constructor, AddOuterLoop() and AddHole() functions)
	  or from the new AddPointCheckForDuplicatees().

2013-03-04 17:06  indianlarry

	* [r54527] src/other/poly2tri/poly2tri/sweep/sweep_context.cc:

	  src/other/poly2tri/poly2tri/sweep/sweep_context.h:
	  Added default constructor, AddOuterLoop() and GetPoints()
	  functions for classes CDT and SweepContext. Added parameters
	  'finalize(bool)' and 'num_points' to Triangulate() function for
	  class CDT and Sweep to be able to stop sweep at any point for
	  debugging. Also added 'num_points' parameter to SweepPoints()
	  function.

2013-03-01 20:32  r_weiss

	* [r54519] src/libged/gqa.c:
	  Added a "-q" option to the "gqa" command. This quiets
	  (suppresses) the "was not hit" reporting.

2013-03-01 18:59  bob1961

	  > 40k).

2013-02-27 20:05  r_weiss

	* [r54504] src/libged/nirt.c:
	  More updates to function ged_nirt.

2013-02-27 19:07  r_weiss

	* [r54503] src/libged/nirt.c:
	  Fixed a bug in the mged nirt command when running on windows.
	  Changed an array to variable length. When a large number of

	  Initial checkin of the 'poly2tri' C++ library for creating a
	  constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) of a polygon using a
	  sweep-line algorithm. This package will be used during the
	  generation of facet meshes for BRL-CAD NURBS. This version of
	  'poly2tri' was obtained from github at
	  'git://github.com/jhasse/poly2tri.git' and based of a google code
	  project of the same name. The methodology implemented is based on
	  the paper "Sweep-line algorithm for constrained Delaunay
	  triangulation" by V. Domiter and and B. Zalik. This checkin is a
	  snapshot of the initial repository code before being integrated
	  into the BRL-CAD build system.

	  src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	  Enhanced Archer's move-arb-edge editing ability by allowing the
	  edge being edited to be changed via the mouse while in translate
	  mode. This provides a more straight forward way to move arb
	  edges.

	  Added code for selecting arb edges (i.e.
	  rt_arb_find_e_nearest_pt2()).

2013-01-30 16:38  carlmoore

	* [r54233] src/tclscripts/mged/lc.tcl:
	  remove trailing blanks/tabs

2013-01-29 22:38  carlmoore

	* [r54226] src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_layer.h:
	  more inline warnings/errors due to the compiler attempting to
	  inline default functions. declaring them quells via intent.

2013-01-29 20:13  brlcad

	* [r54225] src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_array.h:
	  gcc 4.4.6 warns about being unable to inline the (implicit)
	  destructor. declaring the destructor implies to not inline,
	  making the warnings/errors go away. performance should be moot,
	  destructor is ON_SimpleArray's virtual.

2013-01-25 22:08  r_weiss

	* [r54207] src/tclscripts/mged/lc.tcl:
	  Fixed a bug and added features to the mged "lc" (list codes)
	  command. Fix a bug which caused some duplicates to not be
	  reported. Added an option to not list duplicates which all have
	  the same parent and material_id. Also added region parent to the
	  list.

2013-01-25 21:08  n_reed

	* [r54206] src/libged/draw.c:
	  Have to count the vlists' commands before appending them, or else
	  s_vlen is always 0. Interestingly, this doesn't change any

2013-01-25 20:37  r_weiss

	* [r54205] src/other/openNURBS/Makefile.am:

2013-01-25 20:31  n_reed

	* [r54204] src/libged/draw.c:

	  "opennurbs_crashtest.h", "opennurbs_memory_new.cpp",
	  "opennurbs.sln", "opennurbs.vcproj" and
	  "opennurbs_staticlib.vcproj". These changes remove files not used
	  by BRL-CAD and are not part of the 2012-10-24 version of
	  openNURBS. In addition this corrects an error "Files listed in
	  subversion but not accounted for in build logic", related to
	  openNURBS, when running "make distcheck-full".

2013-01-25 14:05  bob1961

	* [r54202] src/libged/draw.c:
	  Fixed a bug in _ged_drawtrees that was causing vlists for
	  previously drawn objects to be created each time anything was
	  drawn, causing the vlists to grow larger for the redrawn objects
	  (i.e. the created vlists were added to the previously created
	  vlists for the redrawn objects).

2013-01-24 21:40  carlmoore

	* [r54201] src/libfft/fftest.c:

	* [r54200] src/proc-db/clutter.c, src/proc-db/pyramid.c,

	  src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl, src/tclscripts/lib/Ged.tcl:
	  Enhanced Archer's move-arb-face editing ability by allowing the
	  face being edited to be changed via the mouse while in translate
	  mode. This makes it simpler and faster to move arb faces by
	  reducing the user's interaction with the GUI.

2013-01-23 22:31  brlcad

	* [r54198] src/util/bombardier.c:
	  clean up the wording a little bit

2013-01-22 20:45  r_weiss

	* [r54197] src/librt/search.c:
	  Fixed a bug in librt file "search.c". Corrected the sort order of
	  the "options" array. This corrects a problem on Windows when
	  using the "-break" option within the mged "search" command. The
	  error was "-below: unknown option passed to find_create".

	* [r54194] src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Added the ability to fire rays to get nirt-like results by using
	  the mouse to pick shot locations while in "Measuring Tool" mode.
	  For speed, the raytracer is prepped only if the display items
	  change. Also added preferences for setting colors for the ray
	  partitions.

2013-01-18 18:58  bob1961

	* [r54193] src/tclscripts/lib/Ged.tcl:
	  Updates for cadwidgets::Ged. Added the following options:
	  -drawRayOdd, -drawRayEven and -drawRayVoid. Also added draw_ray,
	  erase_ray and color_to_tk.

2013-01-18 18:22  carlmoore

2013-01-17 20:57  r_weiss

	* [r54188] src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_zlib.cpp:

	* [r54186] src/libbu/getopt.c:
	  Fixed a bug in function "bu_getopt" in file "getopt.c". The
	  function would confuse a negative number with an number option
	  (i.e. -0 -1 ... -9).

2013-01-16 18:06  bob1961

	* [r54185] src/tclscripts/archer/SketchEditFrame.tcl:

2013-01-15 14:45  bob1961

	* [r54175] src/tclscripts/archer/SketchEditFrame.tcl:
	  More tweaks for Archer's sketch editor. Update the
	  handle_configure method to redraw the grid after receiving a
	  window configure event. Whether we're in detail mode or not, the
	  segments need to be created in the canvas.

2013-01-14 23:49  starseeker

2013-01-14 22:43  brlcad

	* [r54172] src/util/pix-png.c:
	  don't set the gAMA chunk if gamma is negative/unset, quells

2013-01-14 20:35  bob1961

	* [r54171] src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/SketchEditFrame.tcl:
	  The following tweaks are for Archer's sketch editor. Update the
	  sketch panel when the units are changed. Use bboxVerts to get the
	  bounding box instead of calling the canvas' bbox method. This
	  results in a better initial scale factor for the sketch view.
	  Hook the edit panel entries to non-array variables. Other minor
	  tweaks.

2013-01-14 20:21  bob1961

	  remove trailing blanks/tabs

2013-01-12 18:25  caen23

	* [r54168] src/other/xmltools/libxml/CMakeLists.txt:
	  In some cases (e.g. OS X), CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT is set to ""
	  when threads are available, causing IF(CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT) to
	  fail even if threads are available. This, in turn, causes
	  compilation of libxml/src/threads.c to fail. We now check if
	  Threads_FOUND is true, which should be more portable

2013-01-11 20:42  bob1961

	* [r54167] src/tclscripts/archer/SketchEditFrame.tcl:

	  Fix several instances of VMINMAX being used without first
	  initializing its min/max arguments. Also, consistently use
	  INFINITY/-INFINITY rather than MAX_FASTF/-MAX_FASTF when
	  initializing. That way if INFINITY/-INFINITY appears in any of
	  the tested points it ends up in min/max rather than being
	  replaced by MAX_FASTF/-MAX_FASTF. That faithful propagation could
	  encourage bug discovery since INFINITY/-INFINITY are likely the
	  result of an unintended divide by 0 or overflow condition.

	  be updated and building on Windows needs to be tested.

2012-12-20 21:24  brlcad

	* [r54104] CHANGES, CMakeLists.txt, HACKING, Makefile.am, NEWS,
	  TODO, autogen.sh, configure.ac, doc/CMakeLists.txt,
	  doc/Makefile.am, doc/deprecation.txt:
	  rename and move doc/deprecation.txt to a new top-level CHANGES
	  file. that name was selected after reviewing a number of other
	  projects with similar deprecation announcement requirements and
	  it seems to be a reasonable evolution. more clearly announcing
	  changes to developer users is just as important (if not more so)
	  as the non-developer 'user-visible' NEWS items. It has also been
	  a repeat topic of discussion, a repeat issue (devs not
	  remembering it's in doc/), and one of the most frequently
	  revisited docs. That's compelling support for introducing a new
	  top-level file. Introducing it into include/ was considered, but
	  it also covers commands.

2012-12-20 18:56  caen23

	* [r54103] src/other/xmltools/libxslt/CMakeLists.txt:
	  Search /usr/local/include/ for headers

2012-12-20 18:32  carlmoore

	* [r54102] src/tclscripts/archer/SketchEditFrame.tcl:

2012-12-20 15:15  brlcad

	* [r54101] src/other/xmltools/libxml/CMakeLists.txt:
	  smells wrong, but we need to search /usr/local/include and our
	  top-level setting isn't propagating to here

2012-12-20 14:09  caen23

	* [r54100] src/other/togl/src/CMakeLists.txt:
	  Compile GLEW only if X11 is available (GCI:
	  http://www.google-melange.com/gci/task/view/google/gci2012/7999218)

2012-12-20 12:41  bob1961

	* [r54099] src/tclscripts/archer/SketchEditFrame.tcl:
	  This mod will allow a vertex to be combined with another if
	  dropped in close proximity.

2012-12-20 08:22  d_rossberg

	* [r54098] src/mged/set.c:
	  added the correct const qualifiers (linked with rev. 54093)

2012-12-20 02:43  caen23

	* [r54097] include/dvec.h:

	  src/other/togl/src/glew/glew.c:
	  Update GLEW to 1.9.0, which seems to solve present buildbot
	  errors

2012-12-20 00:50  caen23

	* [r54095] CMakeLists.txt:
	  Fix previous commit which removed some lines, causing a build
	  failure with X11 enabled

2012-12-19 23:47  caen23

	* [r54094] CMakeLists.txt, src/libfb/tcl.c:
	  X11 is available if the required files in both include/ and lib/
	  can be found (GCI:
	  http://www.google-melange.com/gci/task/view/google/gci2012/7999218)

2012-12-19 23:25  brlcad

	* [r54093] include/bu.h, include/raytrace.h:
	  gcc notices en masse that we assign string literals to non-const
	  struct elements. fixed by adding const qualifier. undoubtedly
	  will need to propagate constness elsewhere too.

	  isn't acceptable for an interface we're not using. it's even more
	  obsoleted as time goes by as a public domain replacement for
	  'crypt' considering some desktop systems can bruteforce crack

	  look to modern methods. doesn't go through our deprecation

2012-12-17 17:18  bob1961

	* [r54073] src/tclscripts/archer/SketchEditFrame.tcl:
	  Updated SketchEditFrame::pick_vertex to take an optional tag
	  argument that gets passed to the canvas' "find" command. Changed
	  the units for mPickTol to pixels. Also changed the line creation
	  mode to assume connected line segments until the user press
	  Escape. This gets rid of the <Shift> modifier.

2012-12-16 21:26  caen23

	* [r54068] include/dvec.h:
	  Explicitly casting the arguments passed to a_store() to (double
	  *) solves compilation errors on x86_64

2012-12-14 19:30  brlcad

	* [r54067] include/bu.h:

	* [r54048] NEWS, src/libbn/randmt.c:
	  ran into an rt crash when I enabled randmt on a highly-parallel
	  system. the global_state static was uninitialized leading to the
	  conclusion that we either have a memory corruption issue or, more
	  likely, a problem with initialization order. c++ guarantees the
	  order will be in the order declared, but I can't find any
	  reference of that guarantee for C. Still, the intermediate

	* [r54037] src/libbn/tests/bn_list.c:
	  strnlen() is a gnu extension, so not okay to use. fortunately,

	* [r54032] CMakeLists.txt:
	  x11 is available on windows, so don't make it impossible to use
	  it. we can just let the checks fall through after looking for it
	  and testing whether aqua is enabled. this allows a slew of
	  simlifications eliminating several of the win32 and apple
	  platform checks, which are bad smells anyways.

	* [r54031] src/tclscripts/mged/openw.tcl:
	  The command window can now be reopened. MGED no longer closes
	  after closing the graphics window. On OpenGL, trying to reopen
	  the graphics window crashes the app. On X11, everything works
	  fine.

	  from Adrián Arroyo Calle that reportedly (untested) implements

	  confirmed after a bit of research that NRTC was indeed the
	  northrOp research and technology center of the northrop
	  corportation, prior to being merged into northrop grumman (1994),

	  Remove src/other man pages from DocBook conversion - while the
	  utahrle and step man page conversions are potentially useful,
	  src/other contains separate projects so they'll need to be set up
	  as separate builds in their respective projects. Revision control
	  will hold the conversions until we're ready for them

	  * @brief vector/matrix math
	  *
	  * This header file defines many commonly used 3D vector math
	  macros,
	  * and operates on vect_t, point_t, mat_t, and quat_t objects.
	  *
	  * @brief matrix representation
	  * 4 x 4 Matrix manipulation functions...
	  *
	  * Matrix array elements have the following positions in the
	  matrix:
	  @code
	  * | 0 1 2 3 | | 0 |
	  * [ 0 1 2 3 ] | 4 5 6 7 | | 1 |
	  * | 8 9 10 11 | | 2 |
	  * | 12 13 14 15 | | 3 |
	  *
	  * preVector (vect_t) Matrix (mat_t) postVector (vect_t)
	  @endcode
	  *
	  * Note that while many people in the computer graphics field use
	  * post-multiplication with row vectors (i.e., vector * matrix *
	  matrix
	  * ...) the BRL-CAD system uses the more traditional
	  representation
	  * of column vectors (i.e., ... matrix * matrix * vector). (The
	  * matrices in these two representations are the transposes of
	  each
	  * other). Therefore, when transforming a vector by a matrix,
	  * pre-multiplication is used, i.e.:
	  *
	  * view_vec = model2view_mat * model_vec
	  *
	  * Furthermore, additional transformations are multiplied on the
	  left,
	  * i.e.:
	  *
	  <tt> @code
	  * vec' = T1 * vec
	  * vec'' = T2 * T1 * vec = T2 * vec'
	  @endcode </tt>
	  *
	  * The most notable implication of this is the location of the
	  "delta"
	  * (translation) values in the matrix, i.e.:
	  *
	  <tt> @code
	  * x' (R0 R1 R2 Dx) x
	  * y' = (R4 R5 R6 Dy) * y
	  * z' (R8 R9 R10 Dz) z
	  * w' (0 0 0 1/s) w
	  @endcode </tt>
	  *
	  * Note -
	  *@n vect_t objects are 3-tuples
	  *@n hvect_t objects are 4-tuples
	  *
	  * Most of these macros require that the result be in separate
	  * storage, distinct from the input parameters, except where
	  noted.
	  *
	  * When writing macros like this, it is very important that any
	  * variables which are declared within code blocks inside a macro
	  * start with an underscore. This (hopefully) minimizes any name
	  * conflicts with user-provided parameters. For example:
	  *
	  * { register double _f; stuff; }
	  *

	  thanks to Cezar's work, turn on validation whenever BRL-CAD's
	  strict build setting is enabled (i.e. most of the time.) xmllint
	  validation is the DocBook analogue to our C/C++ strict flags, so
	  it makes sense to enable both when we're being 'strict' - forces
	  us to keep the sources in a clean state.

2012-11-24 16:42  brlcad

	  Updated the extrude edit panel by getting rid of "Rotate H" and
	  adding "Move End HR". Also added code to _ged_translate_extrude()
	  to move H while maintaining perpendicularity among H, U and V
	  without the random flipping of vectors as seen in tgc (fixing
	  this next).

	* [r53792] include/bu.h:
	  document the INFINITY magic number for the fall-back case

2012-11-21 04:55  brlcad

	  rearrange the ancient INFINITY constants to use available
	  platform-defined limits that usually represent infinity. fall
	  back to what we were doing if all else fails, but it should
	  increase our modeling range to the extent available for fastf_t.

2012-11-21 04:42  brlcad

	* [r53790] include/bu.h, include/raytrace.h:
	  move the INFINITY define from raytrace.h over to bu.h with the

	* [r53750] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_bool.c:
	  Fixed a bug in function "nmg_bool" in file "nmg_bool.c". Changed
	  when classlist is allocated to after all changes to the model are
	  complete. The reason is these changes increase the number of
	  objects in the model and the allocated size of classlist needs to
	  be large enough for all the objects. Also changed when function
	  "nmg_classify_shared_edges_verts" is called to after all changes
	  to the model are complete.

	* [r53747] src/librt/bool.c:
	  remove a hard-coded 0.001 constant that has been in here since
	  1989 (mike, r3900). the intent seems to be to discard partitions
	  that are behind the ray start point implying the constant was
	  attempting to capture near-zero or negative partitions. this
	  should be something below SMALL_FASTF but the 'large' value
	  implies it may be accommodating compound math model-space values
	  so go with the more dynamic distance tolerance (0.0005) which
	  makes this only slightly tighter than it was. regression
	  tested/passed on osx.

	  impacts NMG boolean operations since raytracing is sometimes
	  necessary to determine if an NMG object is in/out/on another NMG

	* [r52938] NEWS:
	  fixed the step-g importer crashing while processing an AP214
	  file. technically numerous crashes, but all related to the
	  unknown entities being skipped. more work is needed, but the
	  fixes prevent step-g from halting gracelessly.

2012-10-10 07:54  brlcad

	* [r52937] src/libnurbs/PullbackCurve.cpp:
	  handle null data propagating through the surface tree if we
	  happen to parse a mixture of unexpected data. this is the final
	  piece that allows the (ap214) opensourceecology data to import
	  via step-g without crashing.

	* [r52936] src/other/step/src/cldai/sdaiString.cc,

	  avoid throwing exceptions due to max() being bigger than actually
	  supported. seems like an stl exception bug given it throws a
	  length_error exception and the parameter is supposed to default
	  to the value we're setting, but work around it anyways. we just
	  set npos and avoid specifying a constructor limit if the value is
	  npos.

2012-10-10 07:04  brlcad

	* [r52935]
	  src/other/step/src/clstepcore/sdaiApplication_instance.cc:
	  prevent a crash parsing entities intended for a different schema
	  (e.g., ap204 data fed to ap203e2 schema parser). eDesc was not
	  being initialized causing random data crash/corruption. even
	  initialized, it ends up being null due to the schema entity
	  mismatch for unrecognized entities, so have to prevent against
	  dereferencing null elsewhere.

	* [r52934] src/other/step/src/cleditor/STEPfile.inline.cc:

	  the entityname can be NULL if we're parsing entities not

	* [r52414] src/librt/test_botpatches.cpp:
	  Simplify the patch building a bit - the 'correct' way to do this

	  src/libged/CMakeLists.txt, src/mged/setup.c,
	  src/other/CMakeLists.txt:
	  The libged per-command build logic was premature - until we have

	  apply sf patch 3565411 (The joint command from the libged
	  library) from Niculaescu Oana ( elf11 ) moving the animedit/joint
	  command from mged to libged. this leaves one todo action for
	  figuring out how to transition 'ghost' wireframe elements without

	  src/mged/cmd.h, src/mged/setup.c, src/mged/vrlink.c,
	  src/tclscripts/mged/help.tcl:
	  remove the old vrmgr 'Virtual Reality manager' interface to mged.
	  it provided a libpkg network interface to mged whereby you could
	  feed mged commands remotely. aside from being a gaping security
	  hole riddled with problems due to a lack of sandboxing, it is no
	  longer being used. ironically, it's more of a geometry service
	  than that 'other' effort ever became, but it's still not worth
	  keeping. the code needs updates and is accessing some functions
	  that it shouldn't, so reduce becomes best.

2012-09-06 20:09  brlcad

2012-09-06 19:38  starseeker

	* [r52376] src/librt/test_botpatches.cpp:
	  Make a note that some better approach would be nice for the

2012-09-06 19:34  r_weiss

	* [r52375] include/nurbs.h, src/libnurbs/PullbackCurve.h:
	  Updated files "include/nurbs.h" and

	  "check_pullback_singularity_bridge", "interpolateCurve",
	  "check_pullback_data" and "pullback_samples" to

2012-09-06 19:21  starseeker

	* [r52373] src/librt/test_botpatches.cpp:
	  Loop until there don't seem to be anymore overlaps - this one we

	  with the surface fitting

2012-09-06 19:20  brlcad

	* [r52372] src/libged/edbot.c:
	  call bu_sscanf instead of sscanf so we can handle %zu without

2012-09-06 19:00  brlcad

	* [r52371] include/nurbs.h, src/librt/primitives/brep/brep.cpp:
	  the old build system scores another point detecting duplicate
	  symbols when it tried pulling libbrlcad together. utah_ray_planes
	  is provided by libnurbs now via the pullback file, so we can
	  eliminate the function in librt's brep implementation.

2012-09-06 18:39  starseeker

	* [r52370] src/librt/test_botpatches.cpp:

2012-09-05 23:03  brlcad

	* [r52357] src/libnurbs/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	  if newton iteration fails, then new_uv could be accessed prior to

2012-09-05 20:06  starseeker

	* [r52356] src/librt/test_botpatches.cpp:
	  As patches are built and cross a threshold of holding 1/100th of
	  the total bot count in the mesh, add additional flatness
	  constraints. Should probably be a post processing step to break
	  up larger patches to ensure consistent behavior.

2012-09-05 16:16  r_weiss

	* [r52355] src/libged/gqa.c:
	  Updated function "summary_reports" in file "gqa.c" for mged

	  which are in the overlap list, are not reported as having zero
	  hits.

2012-09-05 14:18  starseeker

	* [r52354] src/librt/test_botpatches.cpp:
	  Move vectors into structure, make threshold for patch merging a
	  parameter. There are indications that large patches may need to
	  be broken up for the sake of feature preservation, possibly based
	  on mesh density... need to read up on the problem.

2012-09-04 20:50  r_weiss

	* [r52353] src/libged/gqa.c:
	  Updated function "summary_reports" in file "gqa.c". This change

	  the first missed region.

2012-09-04 20:47  r_weiss

	* [r52352] src/librt/primitives/tgc/tgc.c:
	  Updated function "rt_tgc_shot" in file "tgc.c". Temporarily
	  disabled some warning messages which were causing a segmentation
	  fault running on 64bit Linux using the "gqa" commnand. It appears
	  for be related to multiple threads, writing to stderr, at the
	  same time.

2012-09-04 20:39  r_weiss

	* [r52351] src/librt/primitives/rec/rec.c:
	  Updated function "rt_rec_shot" in file "rec.c". Initialized the

	  object magic number. This allows any NMG object type to be fused
	  instead of just NMG models. Changed files "include/raytrace.h",
	  "src/libged/bot_fuse.c", "src/libged/wdb_obj.c",
	  "src/conv/euclid/euclid-g.c", "src/conv/jack/jack-g.c",
	  "src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_fuse.c" and
	  "src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_bool.c".

	  move opennurbs_ext.h to include/nurbs.h - we need to untangle

	  This fixes a bug in the "adjust" command where an rgb attribute
	  could not be removed. db5_sync_comb_to_attr() was missing code to
	  remove an invalid rgb. rt_comb_adjust() depends on the rgb
	  getting removed when marked as invalid (i.e. when "invalid" or
	  "none" is specified).

2012-07-31 19:58  r_weiss

	* [r51733] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_fuse.c:
	  Updated function nmg_edge_g_fuse and added functions ex_comp
	  ey_comp and ez_comp which are used by the updated nmg_edge_g_fuse
	  function. These changes are in file "nmg_fuse.c". These changes
	  were to improve the performance of the nmg_edge_g_fuse function.
	  This change effects the mged facetize and ev commands along with
	  most of the geometry export tools. The performance improvement is
	  most noticed when the number of facets in the model is roughly
	  over 50,000.

	  Added a mechanism for using mouse interactions to edit the matrix
	  above some member of a combination. Previously, mouse
	  interactions resulted in edits getting pushed into the selected
	  object. That is if the selected object was a combination, the
	  edits wound up as matrices above all members in the combination.
	  And if the selected object was a primitive, the edits were pushed
	  into the primitive. Archer has another mode button in the toolbar
	  for deciding how mouse interactions are applied to the select
	  object.

	  richard fix a TIE BoT mesh evaluation problem where raytracing a

	  robust behavior.

2012-07-27 02:37  brlcad

	  instead of calling isnan(), prevent the division by zero
	  altogether. division by zero can crash on non-ieee systems and be
	  configured to throw an exception even on modern systems (which
	  will abort the application). the intent is to just skip
	  perpedicular faces, so using RT_DOT_TOL should give more
	  consistent repeatable behavior.

2012-07-26 21:51  r_weiss

2012-07-01 06:46  crdueck

	* [r51382] src/libged/analyze.c:
	  checkpoint very rough analyze_bot command, correctly computes
	  surface area and volume

2012-07-01 05:42  starseeker

	* [r51381] src/librt/test_botpatches.cpp:
	  pick outer loop - generally seems to look OK, but will need some
	  per-patch verification

2012-07-01 04:09  phoenixyjll

	* [r51380] src/librt/primitives/superell/superell_brep.cpp:
	  Fix header.

2012-07-01 02:25  starseeker

	* [r51379] src/librt/test_botpatches.cpp:
	  Don't just need loops, need to know which loop is the outer loop.
	  Could cheat since we're using xyz planes at the moment, but since
	  this should be more general need to project edge points onto a
	  common plane for bbox comparison. Start preparing needed pieces.
	  For now, turn off NURBS components - not ready for them yet.

2012-06-30 20:50  crdueck

	  print_volume_table() now prints a newline before the table. every
	  calling function in analyze.c was already doing this anyways

2012-06-29 21:25  n_reed

	* [r51372] src/other/step/src/express/CMakeLists.txt:
	  scl_version_string.h needs to be generated before fedex.c is
	  compiled

2012-06-29 12:33  d_rossberg

	* [r51371] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_copy.c:
	  there was a change in the memory management of the NMG primitive:
	  we have to use the same memory manager (bu_pool) here too

2012-06-29 09:13  anrgmrty

	* [r51370] src/conv/g-voxel.c:

2012-06-29 01:23  crdueck

	* [r51363] src/librt/primitives/rpc/rpc.c:
	  minor change to order of declaration for some variables

2012-06-29 00:02  starseeker

	* [r51362] src/librt/test_botpatches.cpp:
	  Add untrimmed fitting of patches. Veeeeerrrry slow but aside from
	  some flipped normals and obviously needing trimming curves the
	  fit itself looks pretty good.

2012-06-28 12:00  phoenixyjll

	* [r51361] src/librt/CMakeLists.txt, src/librt/Makefile.am,
	  src/librt/primitives/superell/superell_brep.cpp,

2012-06-27 14:15  r_weiss

	* [r51357] src/tclscripts/mged/grouper.tcl:
	  Update to mged gr/grouper command. Improved the speed of
	  processing, added more error checking. Changed the output of
	  selected objects so 200 or less are listed on a single line,
	  greater than 200 each object is listed on its own line. This is a
	  temporary hack to prevent script lockup on windows.

2012-06-27 14:09  starseeker

	* [r51356] src/librt/test_botpatches.cpp:
	  Instead of building a vertex->face map and postprocessing, build
	  an edge->face map and work directly with that.

2012-06-27 13:40  starseeker

	* [r51355] src/librt/test_botpatches.cpp:

2012-06-27 08:22  d_rossberg

	* [r51352] src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	  "parent" is a C++ object in librt context here, so free it
	  accordingly

2012-06-27 04:15  starseeker

	* [r51351] src/librt/test_botpatches.cpp:
	  Needs debugging, but this looks promising as a way to break down
	  meshes faster than rt_bot_split

2012-06-26 22:37  anrgmrty

	* [r51350] src/conv/g-voxel.c:
	  voxelize removed from main() and made part of a function in
