	* configure.ac:
	stash the current configuration args before adding additional ones for 
the subconfigures, then restore to the original so recheck configures don't 
persist the subconfigure arguments to the top configure (e.g. --disable-shared)

	* src/mged/setup.c:
	remove the call to the private TclInitEncodingSubsystem() call that 
worked around a 8.4/8.5 race-condition bug inside Tcl_FindExecutable() whereby 
mged would crash.  it's not reproduced on a simple test case any more for 
unknown reasons.

	* src/libtclcad/tclcadAutoPath.c:
	use bu_file_exists() instead of Tcl_FSStat() to avoid getting header 
define/symbol mixups in tcl headers (that seem to be causing a crash at least 
on some linux due to Tcl_StatBuf getting written past, wrong size)

	riker notes that hd and wall conflict with similarly named system 
tools, consider renaming.  love the mug idea from bjork... :)

	* src/conv/g-acad.c, src/conv/g-dxf.c, src/conv/g-nff.c, 
src/conv/g-obj.c, NEWS:
	Shawn Baker identified a bug in g-dxf (which in turn was found in 
g-acad, g-nff, and g-obj too) where the -i argument ended up gobbling up the 
following argument incorrectly.  e.g g-dxf -i -o filename.dxf blah.g object 
would end up in a filename.dxf error.

	* src/other/incrTcl/itcl/generic/itcl_methods.c, 
src/other/tcl/generic/tclProc.c:
	account for a new tcl/itcl interaction bug caused by the upgrade to 
8.5, first reported by alice and soon after by john, whereby tcl panics and 
aborts mged when you call up the combination editor or other incrtcl interface 
widget.  upon further investigation, patches are made to both tcl and incrtcl 
to 1) not panic as the check is bogus/inappropriate at that place in tcl (body 
is empty and marked as such) and 2) actually provide a compiled body pointer 
(which is what it was aborting on) just with an empty string (idea extracted 
from code already in incrtcl cvs).  either fix alone takes care of the problem 
but we apply to both so we can work with combinations of system or compiled tcl 
and itcl.  woot, that was the last issue holding up release...

	since libutil is forced static, skip libtool and just build a static

2007-04-03  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

src/anim/Makefile.am, configure.ac, doc/html/Makefile.am:
	restructure library linkages so that brl-cad libraries no longer list 
their dependencies as a LIBADD.  dependencies are moved into configure.ac and 
provided via _LIBS variables so that they are specified at link time.  this 
supports hybrid static library compilation as well as other more varied mixture 
configurations.  use the new _LIBS variables throughout.  probably want to 
re-combine them later into a single symbol name per library but this will 
suffice for now.

	* src/other/tcl/Makefile.am, src/other/tk/Makefile.am:
	the work is never done.  clean up the build specification for tcl/tk so 
that other targets like install, distclean, distcheck, and even uninstall 
(which tcl/tk bastages don't provide themselves) now work.  have to expand the 
unix subdir to appease distcheck success.

	* src/other/libutahrle/Makefile.am:
	don't include the include dir because it's now a SUBDIR, otherwise 
distcheck whines

2007-04-02  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/html_library.tcl:
	8.5 now seems to use -tabs for text widgets instead of -tab

2007-04-02  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/mged/comb.tcl:
	text widget option -tab is now an illegal abbreviation for -tabs (as of 
tcl 8.5). Changed -tab to -tabs.

2007-04-02  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/tclcad.h: declare tclcad_tcl_library()

	* src/libtclcad/tclcadAutoPath.c:
	add support for running successfully from a distcheck and identifying 
the tcl resources.  also set tcl_library so that init.tcl is identified.  add a 
tclcad_tcl_library() routine for debug printing of what tcl_library is set to.  
now only appends to auto_path if the dirs exist.

	* src/tclscripts/ami.tcl, src/tclscripts/ampi.tcl:
	the script wasn't correctly parsing multiple directory paths and also 
similarly did not function with a distcheck or other compilation out of place.  
It still has a problem if it cannot write to the source dir since the index is 
created where the sources files are.

	* src/tclscripts/Makefile.am:
	encourage finding init.tcl, set TCL_LIBRARY

	* src/bwish/main.c: emphasize any errors, separate out result.

	* NEWS: framebuffer toggle added to raytrace panel in mged

	* src/tclscripts/mged/rt.tcl:
	add a checkbox toggle to the raytrace control panel that allows the 
framebuffer to be enabled/disabled more quickly than hitting one of the menu 
options.

	* configure.ac: generate the Cubit Makefile and traverse into that dir

2007-03-28  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/isst/master/master.c:
	the variable is "isst_master_observer_frame", not 
"isst_master_observer".

	* src/adrt/libtienet/tienet_master.c:
	Use "tienet_master_socket_list" instead of undeclared 
"tienet_master_socke_list". Don't people try to compile before committing 
anymore?

	* src/adrt/libtie/kdtree.c:
	test the malloc instead of trying to dereference a void ptr to test the 
malloc...

2007-03-28  jlowenz  <jlowenz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/proc-db/brep_cube.cpp, src/proc-db/brep_simple.cpp:

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	bug fixes - simple brep cube now renders (some acne, though). twisted 
brep still has problems, argh.

2007-03-28  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:

2007-03-28  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/external/Makefile.am:
	include the external plugins in the dist regardless of being 
enabled/disabled for compilation

2007-03-28  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/vector.h, include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:
	VC++ 6.0 adaptions:
	removed (redundant) struct keywords
	removed the unnecessary friend statements (operator<< does not access 
private class members), they cause trouble only

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp: move does not return a value

2007-03-27  jlowenz  <jlowenz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/proc-db/Makefile.am, src/proc-db/brep_simple.cpp:

	* include/brep.h:
	need to cache brep in specific structure, since internal goes away

	* include/vector.h, include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:

distribution, documentation, source analysis, and external linkages.

2007-03-23  jlowenz  <jlowenz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	add bv intersection routines. add rough initial rt_shot implementation 
using openNURBS functionality. needs testing!

	* include/brep.h:
	add constants for ray-brep intersection routine (may need to be 
adjusted)

	* include/vector.h, include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:
	add map function and a couple binary operators

2007-03-22  mjgillich  <mjgillich@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/external/Makefile.am, src/external/README: Added Cubit

	* src/external/Cubit/g-sat.cxx:
	first production version with some cleanup. Works with most tested 
inputs including complex geometry. uses BBs when tessellation fail.  still has 
some shutdown issue, maybe some other minor issues.  requires Cubit 
libraries/headers to compile.

this probably would be a good reason to being associating with libbu.. (this 
fixes sf bug 1680679 - Check return codes everywhere; submitted by Markus 
Elfring (elfring))

	* configure.ac:
	GAH, case typo s/TCl/TCL/ .. explains why Tcl and itcl would 
periodically pass their functionality test when they should not have.  also, 
re-enable the touch of the header template, but this time only if the file is 
non-empty -- needs more testing across autoconf versions still.

	* src/other/tcl/Makefile.am, src/other/tk/Makefile.am:
	er, don't do nothing.. make make noprod work correctly, remove the 
tcl/tk products

	* misc/enigma/Makefile.am:
	make make noprod work correctly, remove enigma binary

	* NEWS:
	erik fixed rtedge multithreaded output render bug reported by clock3 
aka Karel Kulhavy (sf bug 1657171 - 7.8.4. rtedge renders bullshit).  the 
problem was a race condition when rendering in parallel on output to a file 
that would cause scanlines to be written to file out-of-order.  a modification 
was made to have file output wait for each line in order before writing.

	* configure.ac:
	since incrTcl needs to link against Tcl internal headers in order to 
compile successfully, that ends up placing a requirement on the version of tcl 
such that it must be at least the version we ship or later.  this should fix 
one of john's compilation woes on ubuntu.

	* TODO: just verify build, too many changes with tcl/tk

	* BUGS:
	dave davis reported that performing a units operation on an empty .g 
file results in an assert bomb (undoubtedly because there's no _GLOBAL)

	* configure.ac:
	add a test for -Wno-non-template-friend so that compilation in 
openNURBS can be quelled for behavior that is intended (gcc assumes we might be 
relying on their previously non-conformant behavior). report CXXFLAGS.. 
probably need to make the BC_COMPILER_* functions sensitive to the AC_LANG..

	* src/mged/edsol.c:
	Fix bug that caused a segfault when the last metaball point was deleted.
	Fixed display when no point is selected. Removed debugging bu_log.

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	implement the bounding volumes in C++, leaf nodes point to faces in 
brep model. add support for implementation of goldsmith and salmon's bvh 
heuristic (not completed).

	* include/brep.h:
	implement the bounding volumes in C++, and move the definition to 
g_nurb.cpp

	* include/vector.h, include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:
	add support for folding a vector into a single value. make the default

	remove XtndRunsv.h as well, obsoleted in urt by rle_code.h

	* include/Makefile.am, include/svfb.h, include/svfb_global.h:
	remove the obsolete svfb.h and svfb_global.h headers.  they are part of 
urtoolkit and were replaced by rle_put.h and rle.h respectively.

	* include/Makefile.am:
	vector headers are missing, bad distcheck, no donut for you

	* src/other/tcl/generic/regex.h:
	tcl's regex.h header assumes that there is magic being provided by 
tclInt.h before it's included (for VOID and CONST among other examples) .. so 
just freaking include it and avoid a make dist error.

	* misc/Makefile.am:
	gah, I thought I already committed this.  traverse into enigma dir, 
don't just shove everything into the dist, else make distcheck thinks that it's 
already been configured and aborts.

	* src/other/libtermlib/termcap.c:
	make it look for our installed termcap file before it uses the one in 
etc, since enabling termlib compilation implies functioning independent.  if 
they want their termcap file, they can still set TERMCAP or link against their 
system terminfo/termcap/curses

	* src/other/libtermlib/Makefile.am:
	version is no longer relevant/known again

	revert the NetBSD libtermcap library.  there are too many dependency 
woes (getcap, db, fgetln, strlcpy) to make it work cleanly without bringing in 
all of db too.  it was only working well under the osx/bsd's because everything 
happened to be available.

	* src/other/libtermlib/termcap.c, src/other/libtermlib/tgoto.c,

	install the termcap.src file into BRLCAD_DATA/etc

	* src/other/libtermlib/termcap.c:
	also search in BRLCAD_DATA/etc for a termcap file.  quell warning on 
cgetent() constness.

	* misc/enigma/Makefile.am:
	include the manpage in the dist, clean up after junk.  makes a local

	update from the old vi termcap sources to the more modern NetBSD 
implementation.  this version doesn't suffer the assumption that there needs to 
be an /etc/termcap among many other improvements.  it's under 3-clause BSD and 
seems to be version 0.6 dated December 17, 2006.

	* src/other/libtermlib/Makefile.am, src/other/libtermlib/termcap.src:
	add a termcap source file, version 9.13.25, pulled from NetBSD.  avoids 
license issues and works with existing library sources.

2007-03-13  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* bench/run.sh:
	pixcmp now reports non-zero code for off-by-one results. handle the 
new/expected return values.

	* BUGS:
	add at least three (rather minor, all with workarounds) bugs noticed 
relating to libfb/ray-tracer file redirection.  libfb cannot utilize standard 
output/error 'device' files (e.g. /dev/stdout) without path trickery, using 
such a device fails if used with a pipe or redirect, and the ray-tracers output 
corrupted imagery if using -o to a non-seekable file (like /dev/stdout).

	* autogen.sh:

	* src/other/tcl/Makefile.am, src/other/tk/Makefile.am:
	restore make dist support by removing 'unix' as a SUBDIRS; add rules

	VC++ 6.0 does not like the (redundant) struct keyword in connection 
with a template

	* include/vector.h: the spezialization is friend, not the template

2007-03-09  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	major update.  this change adds support for protected recursive build 
preparations, saving copies of all the relevant COPYING/INSTALL files that 
might get stomped on by automake/autoreconf (EVEN WHEN USING 
AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS).  the files are even still stashed into memory too by using 
tricksy path-specific variables.  this fix will restore the files correctly 
regardless of whether autoreconf or manual steps are taken.  t'is a royal 
hassle just to compensate for automake's bad behavior, but it at least all 
seems to be working well.

	* src/librt/.cvsignore: ignore brep_test

2007-03-08  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	tweak the point eval formula a tiny bit to allow negative points

	* src/mged/edsol.c:
	update metaball solid editing to follow pipe semantics (fixes a few 
crashes)

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c: shift segment to fix method bug

2007-03-08  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/Makefile.am:
	restructure brep compilation so that it uses the new SSE flags from 
configure, distinguish between cflags and cppflags.

	* TODO, NEWS:
	increased output precision on mged 'analyze' command, by request from 
Dwayne Kregel and friends for their modeling purposes.

	* src/mged/anal.c:
	by request from Dwayne Kregel and others, increase precision of the 
analyze command output from 3 or 4 points after decimal to 8.

2007-03-08  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/util/Makefile.am:
	remove dup ${PKG} entries, keeping "friendly" link order

2007-03-08  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO:
	mged now finds its resources more reliably at run-time with the 
auto_path updates in tclcadAutoPath.c

	* TODO: tcl/tk have been updated now

2007-03-08  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/rttherm/Makefile.am, src/util/Makefile.am:
	missing libs from the "whoosh"

	* src/proc-db/Makefile.am:
	Missing CFLAGS (tcl/generic). Missing libs. Whoosh.

	* src/gtools/Makefile.am, src/halftone/Makefile.am, 
src/irprep/Makefile.am, src/librt/Makefile.am, src/nirt/Makefile.am:
	missing libs from the "whoosh"

2007-03-08  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/canon/Makefile.am: need PKG for FB

	* src/conv/g-xxx.c: c89 support, declare functions first

2007-03-08  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac, include/sysv.h, src/libsysv/Makefile.am, 
src/libsysv/libsysv.dsp, src/libsysv/strlcpy.c:
	since basename was removed from libsysv we do not need strlcpy any more

src/anim/Makefile.am:
	whoosh! push BU, BN, and RT (and maybe one or two others) out of 
library LIBADD declarations down to application LDADD linkage.  this means that 
there might be issues to solve again towards being able to generate fully 
contained/resolved libraries (e.g. frameworks), but solves the current problem 
of linking against static tcl/tk libraries portably.  duplicate symbols become 
a problem at link time (bu, bn, and rt all use tcl).  pushing the link 
specification all the way down to the binary (so far) makes everyone happy.

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	use []'s instead of .at() for portability.. and with that minor edit, 
g_brep actually compiles under irix (gcc) now.  the header b0rkage from a 
couple weeks ago is apparently /dev/null'd through all the rewrites and changes

	* src/proc-db/Makefile.am:
	restructure the proc-db compilations since they all pretty much need 
the same libraries.  also, minimize all the conditionality around brep_cube so 
it only toggles whether OBJ_BREP is set or not.

	* src/proc-db/brep_cube.cpp:
	allow the procedural example to compile with or without OBJ_BREP, just 
provide a stubbed run-time error message.

2007-03-07  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	reorder things in the record to keep like types together (breaks binary 
compatability with previous metaball primitives)

2007-03-07  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/proc-db/nmgxplode.c:
	all the rukus about nmgxplode not compiling .. yet the program doesn't 
do a damn thing.  looks like the start of something that was never even fully 
started.  delete the damn turd.

	* src/lgt/apply-mdb.c:
	on second thought, just declare the code obsolete.  mat_Open_Db() and 
friends are nowhere to be found, not worth the effort to find for this simple 
snippet.

	* src/lgt/apply-mdb.c, src/proc-db/apply-mdb.c:
	apply-mdb.c is not a procedural database, doesn't belong in proc_db.  
moved from src/proc_db to src/lgt/.

2007-03-07  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libtclcad/Makefile.am:
	change dependancy to libfb, SHOULD snarf in tcl if necessary via libbu

	* src/other/tcl/Makefile.am, src/other/tk/Makefile.am:
	change depends to depend on all-am to avoid recursive issue

	* src/other/tcl/Makefile.am, src/other/tk/Makefile.am:
	include makefile defs, for "depends" target

2007-03-07  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	have configure check for the -msee and -msse2 gcc options, provide them 
together as SSE to the makefiles

	* src/conv/fast4-g.c:
	massive restructuring of the code.  functions are defined in visibility 
order so declarations are unnecessary, functions are made static so they don't 
collide with librt's similar (but not identical) importFg4Section.c symbols 
(Add_bot_face, do_trid, do_quad, and do_tri functions; grid_pts variable), 
rename aforementioned and others with an f4_ prefix just to entirely avoid the 
naming confusion, reorder macros, defines, static vars, and functions into 
sections, and of course massive ws update while we're at it.

2007-03-07  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:
	bu_basename returns a const: variable type fixed (compiler warning)

misc/win32-msvc/Dll/brlcad.dsp, src/libbn/libbn.dsp, src/libbu/libbu.dsp, 
src/librt/librt.dsp:
	TCL was moved to src/other/tcl: include path modified

2007-03-06  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/setup.c, src/mged/cmd.c:
	should no longer need the tcl-private tclInt.h header... (definitely 
needs more testing, but progress towards NOT using it)

	* src/other/tk/unix/.cvsignore, src/other/tcl/Makefile.am, 
src/other/tcl/unix/.cvsignore, src/other/tk/Makefile.am:
	make sure the generated build files are either ignored or deleted

	* misc/win32-msvc7/libbu/libbu.vcproj, src/libbu/libbu.dsp:
	add basename.c to the windows build system

	* src/libtclcad/tclcadAutoPath.c:
	use bu_basename(), no longer need libgen.h

	* src/libsysv/basename.c:
	no longer need basename.c, replaced by libbu functionality as 
bu_basename() in src/libbu/basename.c

	* src/libsysv/libsysv.dsp: no longer compile basename.c

	* src/nirt/Makefile.am: need libbu

	* src/nirt/if.c:
	use bu_basename instead of basename, no longer need libgen.h

	* include/raytrace.h, src/librt/tree.c:
	remove rt_basename.  its functionality was merged into libbu as 
bu_basename.

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am: remove basename.c from libsysv

	* src/librt/db_tree.c, src/librt/tree.c:
	bu_basename replaces rt_basename, ws updates

	* include/sysv.h:
	there's a bu_basename to match the bu_dirname now, so sysv compat can 
go away (though I'm not sure basename() was part of sysv api?) .. the function 
signature was also causing an irix build failure due to incompatible constness.

2007-03-06  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/isst/master/compnet.c, src/adrt/libtexture/texture_image.c:

	* src/conv/g-var.c: fix header confusion

2007-03-06  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:

2007-03-06  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/tcl/Makefile.am, src/other/tk/Makefile.am:
	map the 'fast' target to 'all-am' to allow 'fast' build to succeed 
without twisting up tcl and tk too much

2007-03-06  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/Makefile.am: add basename.c to the build

2007-03-06  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/edsol.c: set magic for new points in a metaball cloud

2007-03-06  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/bu.h:
	declare bu_basename, make note to make dirname return something const

	* src/libbu/basename.c:
	add an initial stub at a bu_basename() to complement bu_dirname() for 
portable path processing.

	* src/libbu/dirname.c: ws

	* configure.ac:
	IRIX provides basename/dirname in the libgen library.  checking for the 
header requires -lgen as a LIBS, so add custom checks for dirname/basename 
functionality

2007-03-06  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/iwidgets/iwidgets.tcl.in:
	use the iwidgets version, not the BRL-CAD version

	* include/vector_x86.h:
	remove "extra qualifications" that g++4 complains about (still works on 
g++3)

	* src/util/Makefile.am, src/vdeck/Makefile.am, src/bwish/Makefile.am,

src/nirt/Makefile.am, src/proc-db/Makefile.am, src/remrt/Makefile.am,

	include SYSV where needed (cygwin)

2007-03-06  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librtserver/rtserver.c:
	Additional mutex protection for sessions. open_session now always 
returns session #0. This will work until we start using dynamic geometry. At
	that point a better session managment scheme will be required to insure 
that sessions with dynamic geometry get associated with the correct users.

2007-03-05  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/bwish/tcl.c:
	don't use TclFormatInt() so we can avoid using the private tclInt.h 
header.  the routine is just a macro wrapper around sprintf anyways.

	* db/tank_car.asc:
	remove the old antiquated/obsolete/defunct GSI phone number.

	* src/mged/Makefile.am:
	hm, should be the last one that uses itk and needs to be able to find 
the internal headers

	* src/bwish/main.c, src/bwish/tcl.c:
	remove the #include of the private tclInt.h header .. "shouldn't" need 
it

	* src/bwish/Makefile.am:
	itk needs access to tcl/tk private headers (time to consider moving 
this to ITK_CPPFLAGS)

	* src/other/incrTcl/itcl/generic/itclInt.h:
	include common.h so that we avoid tcl's compat headers (this wouldn't 
be an issue if we let incrtcl run it's configure)

	* src/libtclcad/Makefile.am:
	save problem as earlier, need to find private tcl/tk headers even if 
linking against system that doesn't have them installed

	* src/other/tcl/unix/Makefile.in, src/other/tcl/unix/configure.in:
	tcl/tk doesn't use automake so have to encourage 'make all' to work 
under IRIX make

	* autogen.sh:
	improve the version number processing so that older oddities like 
automake 1.4-p6 are better parsed and compared as that the old version doesn't 
sneak in as 1.46 but as 1.4.6 instead.  add a verbose debug line so it's more 
obvious what's being compared.

	* src/other/incrTcl/itk/generic/Makefile.am:
	son uña y mugre .. if you need one, you need the other due to version 
checks in tk.h

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am: typo, missing trailing slash

	* src/other/tcl/unix/configure, src/other/tk/unix/configure:
	recursive autogen.sh/autoreconf works with ac_config_subdirs, so 
configure is properly regenerated.  don't need/want it in cvs since it's 
repeatedly updated.

	* src/other/incrTcl/itk/generic/Makefile.am:
	even if linking against a system tcl, incrtk needs access to tcl's 
private headers in order to compile (tclInt.h in particular).  this fixes 
compilation error reported in sf bug 1672166 (Build attempts to use non-public 
Tcl header, reported by Andrew P. Lentvorski, Jr. - bsder).

	* src/other/incrTcl/itcl/generic/Makefile.am: one per line cppflags

	* src/other/incrTcl/itcl/generic/Makefile.am:
	even if linking against a system tcl, incrtcl needs access to tcl's 
private headers in order to compile (tclInt.h in particular).  this fixes 
compilation error reported in sf bug 1672166 (Build attempts to use non-public 
Tcl header, reported by Andrew P. Lentvorski, Jr. - bsder).

	* misc/archlinux/.cvsignore: ignore the generated files

2007-03-04  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/Makefile.am:
	tclcad needs to come before the others so it can resolve tk/Xss symbols

	* configure.ac: linux needs libxss too for tk

	* src/bwish/main.c:
	interesting this worked before.. need tcl.h before tclInt.h

	* include/vector.h:
	common.h comes before all system headers.  wasn't able to find an 
alternative (though I didn't look really hard) for emmintrin.h, so if the 
header doesn't exist don't do the x86 vector foo.

	* include/vector_x86.h:
	apparently some linux systems don't have emmintrin.h

	* configure.ac:
	check for the emmintrin.h header for g_brep's vector code; tcl needs 
libm on linux; bu/bn/rt are tied to tcl

	* src/libtclcad/tclcadAutoPath.c:
	incrTcl prior to 3.3 apparently didn't provide ITK_VERSION, so 
accommodate.  also quell warning about basename() taking non-const paths on 
linux.

	* src/librt/g_dsp.c:
	whoa that's a big typo.  dsp_name is a struct bu_vls.. have to get the 
address to check/print it.

2007-03-03  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	non-mac tcl compiles against libdl, so add it as a dep in here (since 
we're static)

	* src/libbu/Makefile.am: htester needs tcl and libm

	* src/other/tcl/unix/configure.in, src/other/tk/unix/configure.in:
	heh, tcl/tk seem to indicate they need autoconf 2.59, which is newer 
than our present 2.52 minimum.  there don't appear to be any post-2.52 macros 
in use, so reduce the AC_PREREQ.

	* configure.ac:
	no longer need to replicate tcl's configure checks since we're using 
AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS so remove the dead sections

	* autogen.sh:
	fix leftover from previous version separation, need to extract the 
numbers if we want to check them directly here. fixes unary operator expected 
errors.

	* NEWS: updated bundled blt to blt2.4z-patch-2

	* NEWS:
	prevent mged shutdown on DSP objects with no data, thanks to IriX64 for 
pinpointing the general locality of code that was causing the shutdown.

	* src/librt/g_dsp.c:
	fix a bug, or at least really bad behavior, where calling up the 
wireframe of a dsp that failed to load any data would cause the app (mged) to 
abort.  the abort was due to a BU_CK_MAPPED_FILE that was occurring before an 
already existing check for whether the data was valid.  reordered correctly, 
and updated the error message to say what wasn't found so the user might have 
an idea of what to look for.

	initial import of packaging files used by Arch Linux, provided by Loui 
Chang (louipc).  I took his files and modified them a little so that they are 
auto-populated with configure details, so there are fewer assumptions (cept 
there's no good way to populate the md5 checksum field without tying this to 
'make dist' somehow; might just be best to remove them).

src/librtserver/Makefile.am:
	upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, 
using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as 
needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a 
rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including 
the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as 
well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance 
and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out 
with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one 
step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

	* src/gtools/g_diff.c:
	use bu_file_exists() instead of stat() to see if the file exists

	* src/mged/setup.c:
	call TclInitEncodingSubsystem() before Tcl_FindExecutable() in order to 
avoid what seems to be a race-condition bug inside Tcl_FindExecutable() 
(bizarre and unknown cause, but this works around the issue)

	* src/libtclcad/tclcadAutoPath.c:
	complete rewrite of the auto_path handling code in support of the 
forthcoming tcl/tk upgrade (8.5a5).  the logic is entirely changed so that less 
arbitrary searching is performed.  now the routine attempts to detect whether 
it's being run from a source directory or from an installed location, and 
allowing TCLCAD_LIBRARY_PATH to be obeyed for additional paths.  this needs 
tweaking/testing on other platforms, but the overall approach is a vast 
improvement to the previous.

2007-03-02  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	don't use winsock if building on cygwin, stick with UNIX style

	* src/conv/Makefile.am, src/conv/comgeom/Makefile.am, 
src/conv/iges/Makefile.am, src/conv/jack/Makefile.am, src/conv/off/Makefile.am, 
src/conv/patch/Makefile.am:
	add SYSV where needed (cygwin)

2007-03-02  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

src/other/jove/describe.com.1, src/other/jove/jove-tutorial, 
src/other/jove/teach-jove.1, src/other/jove/teach-jove.sh:
	restructure and simplify the jove tutorial/teaching stuff.

2007-03-02  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/librt/Makefile.am:
	wire in libsysv as a librt dep (cygwin)

	* src/libsysv/basename.c: include appropriate headers (cygwin fix)

2007-03-02  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/nirt/pkgIndex.tcl, src/tclscripts/pl-dm/pkgIndex.tcl, 
src/tclscripts/rtwizard/pkgIndex.tcl, src/tclscripts/util/pkgIndex.tcl, 
src/tclscripts/lib/pkgIndex.tcl, src/tclscripts/mged/pkgIndex.tcl, 
src/tclscripts/pkgIndex.tcl:
	ws

	* src/tclscripts/ami.tcl, src/tclscripts/ampi.tcl:
	aha! enlightenment hath arrived.  creating the index files actually 
sources the file args provided so when it ends up running the other amp?i.tcl 
script, it was choking on the error.  just return 0 to indicate success.

	* src/tclscripts/ami.tcl, src/tclscripts/ampi.tcl:
	heh, there's quality control for ya.. check for existance of variable 
name so we actually do some work..

	* src/tclscripts/ami.tcl:
	abort with a clean message if a tclIndex file does not exist since 
open's failure message is less than ideal

	* src/tclscripts/ampi.tcl: oop, remove debug print

	* src/tclscripts/ampi.tcl:
	abort with a clean message if a pkgIndex.tcl file does not exist since 
open's failure message is less than ideal

2007-03-01  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/bu.h: s/srtdup/strdup/ typo

	* src/tclscripts/mged/help.tcl:
	how about fixing the problem instead, should be wdb_bot_smooth

2007-03-01  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/mged/help.tcl:
	wdb_smooth_bot doesn't seem to have a help entry, which causes all hlep 
to fail. commenting it out for now...

2007-03-01  jlowenz  <jlowenz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/brep_test.cpp:
	finish testing methods of dvec<>. add simple performance test for 
dvec<>.

	* include/vector.h, include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:
	"finish" implementing dvec. added operator for debugging.

	* src/librt/brep_test.cpp: add simple test for dvec<8> correctness

	* include/vector.h, include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:
	more progress on dvec class: constructors, equality and addition.

2007-02-28  jlowenz  <jlowenz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/vector.h, include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:
	begin fleshing out arbitrary length vector class. class definition and 
stub functions.

	* include/vector_x86.h:
	switch to SSE intrinsics (more portable than builtins)

2007-02-28  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libsysv/strlcpy.c:
	include unistd.h for size_t definition (fixes linux/amd64 build)

2007-02-28  jlowenz  <jlowenz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:
	fix inlining of << operator. should alleviate the problems with 
multiply-defined symbols seen earlier.

	* include/vector_x86.h:
	temporarily define replacements for missing(?) builtins

	* src/librt/brep_test.cpp, src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	explicitly include vector at compilation unit.

	* src/librt/Makefile.am:
	remove optimization flags. probably need to move the sse flags 
somewhere else too.

	* include/brep.h:
	Do not include vector.h in brep.h, since it generates multiply defined 
symbols across libraries (i.e. librt/libwdb)

	* include/vector.h:
	Wrap vector in extern c++, fix multiply-defined symbol errors on 
vequals function

2007-02-27  jlowenz  <jlowenz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/brep_test.cpp:
	Add brep_test program for simple unit testing

	* src/librt/Makefile.am: Add compilation of brep_test program

	* include/brep.h:
	Include vector class for use by brep intersection routines

	* include/vector.h, include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:
	Add vector class, with very initial support for simd operations.

2007-02-27  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librtserver/rtserver.c:
	Added mutex protection for session open and close

2007-02-27  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:
	include sysv.h to get the basename prototype (in case HAVE_BASENAME is 
not defined)

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am: strlcpy.c added

	* src/libsysv/libsysv.dsp: basename.c and strlcpy.c added

	* src/libsysv/strlcpy.c: should know its own prototype

	* src/libsysv/basename.c: errno.h defines ENAMETOOLONG
	should know its own prototype

	* include/config_win.h: HAVE_MEMSET and HAVE_STRTOK added

	* include/sysv.h: initial addition of strlcpy()
	typo in basename declaration

	* src/libsysv/strlcpy.c: initial addition of strlcpy()

	* configure.ac: test for strlcpy

2007-02-27  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	hmm.. such a conundrum.. it is nice to clean up and blow away the 
aclocal.m4 that configure drops in but now that recursive configure works, 
tcl/tk actually use their own custom aclocal.m4 (instead of acinclude.m4) so 
deleting the file has undesireable impact on build prep.  disable aclocal.m4 
deletion for now.

	* configure.ac, src/other/jove/teach-jove.in:
	add automatic generation of the teach-jove script during configure

	* src/other/libtermlib/termcap.c:
	prevent crashes if termcap is asked to perform a tgetnum() after a 
tgetent() fails

2007-02-26  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/canon/canonize.1: fact that it uses stat(2) is inconsequential

	* src/mged/rtif.c:
	use bu_same_file() instead of stat() directly to compare whether the 
saveview script database and the current database are the same file

	* src/mged/rtif.c:
	massive cleanup, ws, indentation, rewrite some of the _WIN32 sections 
so there are fewer duplicate code sections.  add a display_error function to 
report the windows read error via a dialog bog

	* src/libbu/stat.c, include/bu.h:
	add the similar routine bu_same_fd() to compare two file descriptors 
returned by open()

	* include/bu.h:
	add bu_same_file() declaration so we can use it in places

	* src/libbu/stat.c:
	add bu_same_file() routine to determine whether two file names are 
indeed the same file or not.  presently, the routine falls back to stat() to 
compare the inode numbers of the files in question

	* autogen.sh:
	some versions of automake report apple's dumb libtoolize problem 
differently, so try to be more general.

	* autogen.sh:
	support projects that use the older/deprecated arg-less AC_INIT and 
instead search for an AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE declaration hopefully instead.  also fix 
a couple missing 'no' typos during manual processing.

	* autogen.sh:
	major modification, now supporting projects that don't use one or more 
of the various autotools (e.g. not using automake, libtool, autoheader, 
libtool).  also now supports projects that have recursive configures that go 
more than one level deep.

2007-02-25  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	autoconf was complaining about AM_C_PROTOTYPES being called after 
AC_C_INLINE and AC_C_CONST, so move it up before them

2007-02-24  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	loop over potential locations instead of just testing for one.  this 
helps subdir configures clean up too if added to their configure.

	* configure.ac:
	be a little more liberal on the -all_load libtool script fix to avoid 
escaping the dollarsign

	* autogen.sh:
	add a function to locate the configure template so that we find the 
right files when running autogen.sh from an ac_config_subdirs directory, 
perhaps being configured/compiled in isolation (without making a copy of this 
script).  also add a sanity check that we did indeed end up with a configure 
script when all was said and done.

2007-02-23  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/libtie/define.h:
	common.h should always be included before any system headers

2007-02-23  jlowenz  <jlowenz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	Begin implementation of brep plot routine. actually use vlist to draw 
mesh.

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	Begin implementation of brep plot routine. start with coarse mesh from 
openNURBS.

2007-02-23  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/libtie/define.h:
	use common.h to wrap brlcad_config.h for external apps

2007-02-23  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	make sure we can restore COPYING/INSTALL when automake decides to 
ignore our umask

2007-02-22  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/nmg_bool.c, include/raytrace.h:
	add flag to silence nmg boolean eval

2007-02-22  jlowenz  <jlowenz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libwdb/brep_stub.c:
	provide a C stub of mk_brep when openNURBS is not built.

	* src/libwdb/Makefile.am, src/libwdb/brep.cpp:
	provide a C stub of mk_brep when openNURBS is not built. prevent NULL 
breps to mk_brep

	* src/librt/table.c:
	provide function table stubs for good behavior when openNURBS is not 
built

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	fix several bugs in the implementation of RT_MemoryArchive. remove use 
of dynamic_cast.

	* include/wdb.h:
	remove the conditional compilation of the mk_brep function

2007-02-21  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	updating the timestamp seems to cause an empty 
include/brlcad_config.h.in under at least some other versions of 
autoconf/autoheader so disable it for now until the reason can be determined.

	* src/other/tkimg/zlibtcl/zlibtclDecls.h:
	seems other versions in the 1.2 line also have voidpc

2007-02-21  jlowenz  <jlowenz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/rtgeom.h:
	Remove ON_BREP conditional, rely on _cplusplus instead

2007-02-21  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/Makefile.am: add brep.h to the dist...

	* src/other/tkimg/zlibtcl/zlibtclDecls.h:
	irritating.. zlib only seems to provide voidpc with the latest versions 
of zlib, and is incompatible with the voidp type found in the older headers.  
conditionally declare using the new zlib's ZLIB_VERNUM.

	* src/other/tkimg/zlibtcl/zlibtclDecls.h:
	don't use voidpc as it's a rather new addition to libz that likely 
might not be available if we're linking against a system zlib.

	* BUGS:
	leave a note that it's known that running any of the various mged 
commands (e.g. clicking the raytrace button many times quickly, or running 
rtarea on a large model) that output a lot of data will hang mged (idle cpu 
utilization)

	* src/other/tkimg/pngtcl/Makefile.am:
	pngtcl needs the zlib cppflags too

2007-02-20  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/mged/prj_add.tcl: header and ws

	* BUGS:
	mged in console mode goes into an inf loop if you try to read from 
stdin using Tcl routines (e.g. read stdin, fgets stdin blah).; mged in GUI mode 
rejects reads on stdin

2007-02-20  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libwdb/Makefile.am: no g_brep.cpp here...

	* src/adrt/Makefile.am, src/bwish/Makefile.am, src/libdm/Makefile.am, 
src/librt/Makefile.am:
	dependancy info

2007-02-20  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/libutahrle/Makefile.am, 
src/other/libutahrle/include/Makefile.am:
	colorquant.h was moved to src/other/libutahrle/include/.

2007-02-20  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/images/Themes/Crystal_Large/Makefile.am:
	required images that need installed...

	* src/other/libpng/Makefile.am:
	libpng.txt was moved to libpng-1.2.16.txt

2007-02-20  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/burst/extern.h, src/nirt/showshot.c: need bu.h for bu_fgets()

	* src/Makefile.am:
	conditionally include opennurbs into libbrlcad (via the new noinst 
library) so that we can fully resolve all librt symbols

	* src/other/openNURBS/Makefile.am:
	create an openNURBS noinst library so that we can fully resolve 
librtserver if brep support is enabled

	* src/rttherm/Makefile.am: add missing dependency on Tcl

	* src/other/incrTcl/itcl/generic/itcl_util.c:
	the specified internal assumptions being made by blt don't hold with 
tcl 8.5 (in particular the set macro doesn't exist), so just comment out that 
section of code.

	* src/other/blt/src/bltNsUtil.h:
	comment out a couple function declarations that are apparently 
declared, at least in 8.5 though they're different/conflicting

	* src/libtclcad/tkImgFmtPIX.c:
	add support for the newer tk 8.5 Tk_PhotoExpand and Tk_PhotoPutBlock 
functions that now expect an interp parameter, but retain compilation 
functionality on previous versions too

	* src/archer/archer:
	search for tcl/tk 8.5 too (we're upgrading to it now)

	* src/mged/setup.c:
	bu_getprogname seems to be behaving now, so use it for selection of the 
executable name unless it does return null for some reason -- then default back 
to just 'mged'. try (again?) to set auto_path before Tcl_Init since we need to 
set up auto_path before init so the scripts, including init.tcl, can be found.

	* NEWS:
	john's bu_fgets() fun and my update to the various tools that needed it 
ends up improved the end-of-line (EOL) processing in about 70+ tools.  
basically any command that read in a text file using fgets().  this fix is 
particularly relevant for running our tools on windows where data files are 
frequently migrated from the unix/linux/max side without a line-ending 
conversion.

	update all usages of fgets() to instead use john's swanktastic 
bu_fgets() that behaves as one would generally want regardless of the line 
ending type of the compilation platform or of the input files.  bu_fgets() 
responds to input files that use CR (usually old mac), LF (usually unix, new 
mac), or CR/LF (usually windows) for the line ending so now these file do too 
effectivley squashing buggish/bad behavior.

	* src/adrt/librender/Makefile.am:
	heh, -lm is not a CFLAG, add it to LIBADD instead using LIBM (still 
need to get adrt's subconfigure working cleanly).

inconsequential value added just to get bu_getopt processing compared to the 
benefit of it still compiling stand-alone if needed.

	convert to bu_fgets(), which of course adds a libbu dependency if there 
wasn't one already.  this allows processing of foreign text files with 
different line endings more consistently.

	* src/conv/Makefile.am:
	turns out that anything being compiled static with gcc and against 
openNURBS needs the -fexceptions flag, that's what was causing the UnwindResume 
linkage error.  link conv-vg2g (ugh, needs renaming) and euclid_unformat 
against libbu (needed for bu_fgets).

	* src/mged/tedit.c: oop, bu_argv0 requires an argument

	* HACKING:
	should use bu_fgets() instead of fgets() since john's addition makes 
file for improved cross-platform processing support in general (parsing unix 
files on Windows, windows files on unix, etc).

	* src/libbu/fgets.c: whoops, formatting asterick garbage on M-q

	* NEWS:
	john continued to rock when he wrote bu_fgets() to allow automatic 
cross-platform line handling ala fgets(), which doesn't necessarily handle all 
of the various line endings that can be encountered (CR, LF, and CR/LF being 
the predominant ones).  in particular, this fix addresses a bug that was 
reported on windows with dxf-g parsing files from another platform incorrectly. 
 note the fix as it applies to dxf-g at least.

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:
	use a filesystem group, these routines have nothing to do with logging

	* misc/win32-msvc7/libbu/libbu.vcproj:
	bu_fgets.c was missing from the vc7 build file, but we can just go 
ahead and add its rename of fgets.c

	* include/bu.h, src/libbu/Makefile.am, src/libbu/bu_fgets.c,

	* HACKING: at least for now.. bu_dirname() instead of dirname()

	* misc/win32-msvc7/libbu/libbu.vcproj, src/libbu/libbu.dsp:
	add dirname.c to the msvc build files

	* include/bu.h, src/libbu/malloc.c:
	get rid of the bu_strdup() dead code and comment how it's really an 
interface macro pass through that provides file:line info when bu debugging is 
enabled

	* src/libbu/malloc.c:
	remove bu_dirname(), was moved to new file dirname.c.

	* src/libbu/Makefile.am: add dirname.c to the compilation

	* src/libbu/dirname.c:
	extract bu_dirname() from malloc.c and put it in its own file.  should 
consider using dirname() since it's part of posix (along with rt_basename() -> 
basename()).

	* src/mged/tedit.c:
	searching for a text editor.. needs the path on argv0, not just the 
name of the binary unless it's going to go hunting for it with bu_which().

	* src/proc-db/brep_cube.cpp: footer and ws

	* src/proc-db/Makefile.am: sort lines, vars first

	* src/proc-db/.cvsignore: ignore newly added brep_cube if it exists

	* misc/enigma/.cvsignore:
	ignore more ac_config_subdir/configure crap dumped in here

	* src/nirt/str_manip.c:
	remove the unnecessary definition of basename() .. libsysv provides a 
better version if it truely is not provided by the system.

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:
	basename() is guaranteed by libsysv now, so no need to check for 
HAVE_BASENAME

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:
	progname is often not the same as argv[0], so modify bu_getprogname() 
accordingly and expose the bu_argv0() function to distinguish between the two.

	* include/sysv.h: add basename()

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am:
	add the new basename.c file, extracted from openbsd (bsd licensed)

	* src/libsysv/basename.c:
	initial addition of basename() so we don't need to test for its 
availability

	* src/libsysv/strdup.c, src/libsysv/bsdselect.c: deknrify the function

	* include/Makefile.am:
	add the new sysv.h header to the noinst header list.

	* include/sysv.h:
	add an initial interface file for libsysv.  this compatibility 
interface shouldn't really be included throughout the package, but may 
ultimatley get added to common.h as part of configuration compatibility.

	* autogen.sh:
	simplify some more, make sed a requirement and abort if it seems to be 
unavailable

	* autogen.sh:
	collapse the version checks into one routine.  improve the version 
checks so that they work more reliably for various version string formats.  
this refactoring should fix a bug in the script where automake 1.10 was being 
incorrectly processed as 1.1.0 among other benefits and code simplification.

2007-02-17  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	AM_PROG_CC_STD was deprecated and later made obsolete by automake 1.8 
with the functionality merged into AC_PROG_CC.  the macro attempted to ensure 
that the compiler is running in 'ansi mode'.  add AM_PROG_CC_C_O to handle 
compilation of non-libtool stuff with compilers that don't happen to support 
the common -c -o syntax.  latest automake seems to be complaining about the 
option being missing/needed (reported by IriX64) during autogen.sh.

	* bench/pixcmp.1:
	document the new -b option for processing and outputting results as 
bytes instead of pixels

	* bench/pixcmp.c:
	major rewrite, almost from scratch.  now supports all of the new 
options (-b, -l, -s, -i) and behaves more closely to cmp.  supports processing 
over files byte-by-byte or pixel-by-pixel, comparing values, tabulating 
results, and reporting them in the format requested.

even being used there.

	* TODO:
	fix the variety of ami.tcl and ampi.tcl tclscript warnings/errors

	* NEWS:
	added support to pixcmp for -s, -l, and -i options for silent, verbose 
output, and support for skipping input making the interface more similar to 
cmp.  also note the addition of a new manual page for pixcmp too.

	* bench/pixcmp.c:
	major rewrite, add support for -s, -l, and -i options for silent, 
verbose output (ala cmp's -l option), and support for skipping input.  make the 
return/error codes more uniform as well as more detail on the usage.  still 
need to actually add the print statement for -l, but everything else should be 
done.  basic operation and previous use remains unaffected.

	* bench/Makefile.am: include the new pixcmp.1 manual page

	* bench/pixcmp.1:
	add initial manual page for pixcmp that includes the variou newly being 
added options (-l -i -s) along with details on return codes and example use.

2007-02-13  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* BUGS:
	there does seem to be a ray-trace consistency failure in the solids.sh 
regression test case where it fails on Mac OS X with one pixel exhibiting an 
off-by-many error on the edge of the middle ARB8.  this only seems to occur 
when using an optimized -O3 compile (and using -fno-unsafe-math-optimizations 
seems to make no difference) possibly indicating a floating point/tolerance 
issue that needs to be accounted for so that results are exactly repeatable 
regardless.

	* configure.ac: reorganize so the eval expansion happens only once.

	* configure.ac:
	compensate for an autoconf inconsistency issue where apparently newer 
2.60+ autoconf is setting datadir to datarootdir as a default, causing a need 
to evaluate datadir before using it with things like AC_DEFINE and AC_SUBST 
values.  do an explicit eval echo like is done for the summary printing.

	thanks to IriX64 for noticing the problem and helping pinpoint the 
cause.  the problem affected most BRLCAD_DATA installation paths as well as awf 
and brlman (which use BRLCAD_DATA).

	* TODO:
	improve adrt's integration, ensure compilation/execution works reliably 
cross-platform -- get latest changes being used by muves teams to libtie.  add 
update of tcl/tk since that is currently going on.

	* autogen.sh: check for autoreconf before autoconv/automake/libtool

	* autogen.sh:
	report the ident footer (which includes the version of this script now) 
with --version output

	* autogen.sh:
	make autogen.sh now report a version number based on the last commit 
date as well as an auto-extracted copyright range.  turn the version error 
reporting into a function so it can be updated in one place and fix/remove the 
trailing _SH that didn't belong.  add comments at the beginning of each of the 
manual steps.  when stashing COPYING and INSTALL in memory, make sure they 
actually fit -- irix seems to have issues.

	* autogen.sh: stash a cvs id for version reporting

	* AUTHORS: f. hartley

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	env(ARCHER_HOME) needs to get set to something even if the set in the 
catch statement fails in order for a pkgIndex.tcl to have the appropriate 
package ifneeded generated.  it was failing because argv0 is not necessarily 
set.

	* AUTHORS:
	noticed that src/tclscripts/bgerror.tcl is documented to have been 
written by Rick Garriques, Jr. so credit him accordingly.  although initially 
written in 2000, the file was added (by bob) as part of the windows port effort.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/pkgIndex.tcl:
	force specification of the Archer package, even though there's a 
processing error related to env(ARCHER_HOME) that still has to be fixed.  this 
issue was noticed and fixed by Yugami - marcbritten, sf patch #1612642.

	* autogen.sh:
	missing var init when printing summary of invalid macros in use

	* autogen.sh:
	gah, search the configure.ac file instead of just sitting there idle

instructions.

	* misc/enigma/COPYING, misc/enigma/INSTALL, misc/.cvsignore, 
misc/Makefile.am:
	no longer generating COPYING.backup and INSTALL.backup

	* autogen.sh:
	change the way COPYING and INSTALL are protected from being clobbered 
by automake's stupid behavior of overwriting our files with generic GNU 
content.  instead of saving a backup to a file in the aux dir, save the 
contents of the file to memory (that is even preserved across internal

	* src/brlman/awf.in, src/brlman/brlman.in: add local variables footer

	* misc/enigma/Makefile.am: sources

	* misc/enigma/enigma.1:
	Joerg spelled CBW incorrectly -- the proper project name is the Crypt 
Breaker's Workbench (this mistake has been impressively spread around the world 
now).

	* misc/enigma/configure.ac:
	test application of PD headers, add a footer too along with detail that 
enigma comes from the Crypt Breaker's Workbench software

	* sh/header.sh: PD work else statement was swapped, fixed.

	* sh/header.sh:
	add recognition of PD for public domain works, remove the GPL and GFDL 
sections.

	* sh/footer.sh:
	recognize lexer and parser files, keep mode and tab-width first in the 
variable list in case variables/values is ever customized

	* sh/header.sh: recognize lexer and parser files

	* sh/footer.sh:
	let .ac and .in files use the specified indent instead of forcing 8

	* misc/enigma/Makefile.am:
	remove the Makefile.defs since enigma has it's own configure and will 
otherwise mess with AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS

	* sh/footer.sh:
	make .in and .ac files use the autoconf major mode instead of Makefile

	* doc/legal/Makefile.am, doc/legal/gfdl.txt, doc/legal/gpl.txt:
	remove the GPL and GFDL licenses.  they are no longer used.  all GPL 
code was relicensed to LGPL, all documentation under the dual-licensing 
GPL/GFDL were relicensed under the BDL (BSD documentation license).

	* misc/enigma/Makefile.am, misc/enigma/configure.ac, 
misc/enigma/configure.in:
	rename configure.in to configure.ac

	* misc/cvs2cl.pl, misc/Makefile.am:
	remove unused ChangeLog processing perl script (rcs2log is used instead)

	* misc/brlcad.spec.in:
	clean up header, add footer, remove reference to GPL as the license

2007-02-07  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/canon/png-ipu.c, src/libdm/dm_obj.c:
	pull system headers up ahead of our headers

2007-02-07  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/libpng/pngconf.h:
	disable the linux setjmp.h double-inclusion protection (at least for 
now) on the assumption that we will get the same setjmp.h and this won't be a 
problem.  add a note that this was modified by us for BRL-CAD.

	beginnings of DEPS flags for "make depends" chaining.

	* misc/Makefile.defs: punty "depends" target

2007-02-06  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	since AC_OUTPUT won't touch the brlcad_config.h.in template if it 
already exists and is unmodified, explicitly touch the file.  this of course 
updates the timestamp and avoids an unnecessary invocation of config.status and 
autoheader in the include/ directory on subsequent compilations.

	* src/librtserver/Makefile.am:
	if librt has opennurbs symbols, include the opennurbs library so that 
the library will hopefully be fully resolved and contained.

	* autogen.sh:
	instead of automatically modifying the configure.ac file if there are 
unsupported known macros being used, just report what those macros are and 
blather on about how that really indicates that probably the version of the 
autotools is specified incorrectly in autogen.sh or that inappropriate macros 
are being used in configure.ac.

	* src/external/ProEngineer/protk.dat.in:
	Modify text and library locations to support execution on Linux

	* src/external/ProEngineer/Makefile.am:
	Update pro/e makefile to support compilation on Linux.

	* src/external/Makefile.am:
	Switch conditional name to WITH_PROE to mirror configure flags.

	* configure.ac:
	Add support for building the Pro/E converter, and specifying Pro/E 
installation path.

2007-02-06  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* regress/weight.sh: use name of script as prefix, not wgt

	* regress/weight.sh:
	update script being used for comparison.  whitespace differences cause 
the test to fail where it should succeed.  include timestamp lines and the 
density table lines since the script strips them anyways, otherwise a 
whitespace script might collapse too many consecutive blank lines.

2007-02-05  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/libpng/Makefile.am:
	either PNG_NO_MMX_CODE or PNG_NO_ASSEMBLER_CODE are required for 
successful compilation on AMD64 Linux with gcc due to linking of 32-bit 
assembly with 64-bit object files.  compiling with -m32 avoids the problem but 
just tack on PNG_NO_MMX_CODE for now since that doesn't limit 
compilation/features like the other two options.  should probably test for this 
mix in configure and set some cppflags accordingly.

	*yawn* remove one of the big two remaining public header sets from our 
include/ directory.  remove tcl headers from include/ and utilize the 
TCL_CPPFLAGS so compilation pulls headers from within src/other/libtcl instead. 
 since bu.h and raytrace.h include tcl foo, this implicates a change across

	update of the bundled zlib from version 1.2.2 to 1.2.3; per the zlib 
website, this eliminates a potential security vulnerability when decoding 
invalid compressed data (VU#238678 / SA11129) as well as eliminates a potential 
security vulnerability when decoding specially crafted compressed data 
(VU#680620 / SA15949). other updates included, see the zlib release notes for 
details.

not be available.

	remove the png headers from our include directory.  png_cppflags are 
now provided by configure and appropriately set to src/other/libpng if we're 
not using a system libpng.  this should help to avoid header conflicts aside 
from just unnecessarily duplicating 3rd party headers. use the new png_cppflags 
as appropriate, though have to add it to _CFLAGS since per target _CPPFLAGS 
support wasn't added until automake 1.7 (and brl-cad allows anything 1.6.0+).

	* src/libfb/if_ogl.c:
	rename ogl_open, ogl_close, and ogl_choose_visual to have an fb_ prefix 
to avoid namespace collisions with libdm.  this should probably be done more 
comprehensively, but gets past the linking error du jour.  declare funcs one 
per line while we're in here.

	Updated to the latest release of libpng, from version 1.2.8 to version 
1.2.16.  Includes all of their ('without config script' distribution) files.

	* HACKING:
	document all of the various library dependencies.  add a description of 
the newly added libbrlcad as well.

	* src/libtclcad/Makefile.am: dependency ordering on libadd libraries

	* src/libdm/Makefile.am: uses libbu and libbn, libadd declare them

	* src/librt/mirror.c: change references to f_mirror to rt_mirror

	* src/mged/chgmodel.c: declare k in f_mirror

	* src/librt/librt.3: update example to use libbu bu_getopt

2007-02-01  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/vls.c:
	provide types for the cray func prototype for bu_vls_printf and 
bu_vls_sprintf now that the function is unk&rified

	* include/bu.h:
	include the same prototype declarations that vls.c uses for 
bu_vls_printf and bu_vls_sprintf.  remove the non-existant bu_vls_blkset.

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c: define some default for a configless compile

	* src/other/blt/src/bltMath.h:
	define BLT_DBL_EPSILON and BLT_FLT_EPSILON so that configless 
compilation will succeed.

	* src/other/blt/src/bltUnixPipe.c, src/other/blt/src/bltVecMath.c:
	add sys/errno.h to appease configless compilation

	* src/other/blt/src/bltMath.h: BLT_DBL_EPSILON isn't defined

	* src/other/blt/src/bltBgexec.c: missing sys/errno.h header

2007-01-31  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/README.IRIX, src/conv/g-var.1, src/conv/g-var.c, 
src/conv/iges/Makefile.am, src/conv/iges/bubbleup.c, 
src/conv/iges/convsolids.c, src/conv/iges/convsurf.c, src/conv/iges/get_att.c, 
src/conv/iges/trimsurf.c, src/libbu/malloc.c:
	consistency on BRL-CAD name use, s/BRLCAD/BRL-CAD/

	* src/conv/jack/g-jack.c, src/conv/jack/jack-g.c: use libbu getopt

	* src/conv/iges/iges.c:
	more BRL-CAD name consistency.  allow BRLCAD or BRL-CAD in the 
attribute string.

	* src/canon/canonize.1:
	consistency on BRL-CAD where not technically problematic, 
s/BRLCAD/BRL-CAD/

	* include/bu.h:
	update comment, USE_PROTOTYPES is set in configure, not machine.h

	* src/conv/comgeom/cvt.c: should be using bu_getopt and friends

	* TODO:
	add c-indentation-style to emacs variable block, setting to k&r or 
something more appropriate than the gnu default (see c-set-style).

	* BUGS:
	tessellation of some pipe in toyjeep.g fails (rather reliably) on a bend

	* sh/header.sh:
	remove the abort if the first line isn't detected.  instead just warn 
and apply the header.  also, add prefix to case for portability and empty 
argument matching.

2007-01-30  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/mirror.c: include string.h if HAVE_STRING_H is defined
	include nurb.h (RT_NURB_EXTRACT_COORDS)

2007-01-29  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/prep.c, src/librt/shoot.c:
	grr, let rt_clean_resource work with a NULL rtip just like 
rt_init_resource (!)

	* doc/README.Windows:
	mention how installation of Tcl is needed with the vc6 build in order 
for the libs to work

	* misc/win32-msvc7/librt/librt.vcproj, src/librt/librt.dsp:
	add mirror.c

	* sh/indent.sh:
	er, if the diff is empty then it means there was no change.  logic 
error somehow snuck in

	* sh/header.sh: c++ source file

2007-01-28  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/linebuf.c: er, define BUFSIZE for setvbuf

	* src/libbu/linebuf.c:
	go with a BUFSIZE buffer instead of min to reduce write flushing

	* src/libbu/linebuf.c:
	windows (vc8) throws an assertion if setvbuf is called with a size of 
zero: ((2 <= size) && (size <= INT_MAX)) .. presumably they want a buffer big 
enough to stash their \r\n or somesuch.

2007-01-27  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/clone.c:
	one step closer, stub out the matrix transformation on solids

	* src/mged/chgmodel.c:
	use the new rt_mirror() function for the guts to f_mirror().  the 
latter is now just a wrapper on the tcl/mged command interface semantics.  part 
of general effort to move mged's editing facilities into librt.

	* src/librt/Makefile.am: add new mirror.c file

	* include/raytrace.h: add the new rt_mirror func

	* src/librt/mirror.c:
	add a new rt_mirror() routine for mirroring an object about a specified 
axis.  the routine is derived from mged's f_mirror command hook and is one step 
closer towards getting rid of the switch on primitive types.  routine takes a 
database instance, a from and to object name, and the axis and returns a 
directory pointer to the new mirror object.

	* include/raytrace.h, src/conv/euclid-g.c, src/conv/iges/brep.c, 
src/librt/nmg_eval.c, src/librt/nmg_extrude.c, src/librt/nmg_mod.c:
	remove the tolerance parameter from nmg_invert_shell.  it's not used, 
contrary to the commented purpose, and just complicates the interface 
unnecessarily so remove it.

	* src/mged/chgmodel.c:
	check for valid access before looking up the object

	* src/mged/chgmodel.c: fix comment, mirror commands, not m command

	* sh/Makefile.am, sh/template.sh:
	initial addition of this file template script.  it generates an empty 
template file with a standard header and footer based on the provided license 
and file type.  basically, it's a warpper on the header.sh and footer.sh script 
along with other clean-up steps generally needed.  add script to dist.

	* sh/header.sh: oop another ref to gpl/gfdl removed.

	* sh/header.sh: should not be using the gpl or gfdl any more

	* sh/Makefile.am:
	it's a nifty generic script, but there's still no real pressing need or 
justification to install it.

	* sh/copyright.sh:
	no need to find configure.ac -- just let it use the current directory 
if no arguments are specified.

	* sh/indent.sh:
	no need to find configure.ac -- just let it use the current directory 
if no arguments are specified.  the helper script can still be searched for as 
needed.

	* sh/ws.sh:
	no need to find configure.ac -- just let it use the current directory 
if no arguments are specified

	* sh/ws.sh: s/one lines/on lines/ typo

	on individual files or in batch mode, and is intended to be run
	periodically to help ensure consistent formatting.  Currently, the
	following actions are performed by default (but can be selected
	individually at run-time):

	  a) removes whitespace on lines that only have whitespace.
	  b) removes whitespace at the end of any line.
	  c) removes successive blanks lines so there are no more than two
	    in a row anywhere in a given file.  WS_SUCCESSIVE=2
	  d) removes all blank lines at the end of a file.
	  e) ensures that there is a newline at the end of file.

	* include/vmath.h: elements_per_mat is a square of elements_per_plane

	* include/vmath.h:
	add similar MAT_SCALE sibling macros for adding, subtracting, and 
multiplying the scaling elements just to be consistent

	* include/vmath.h: s/NUL/MUL/ typo

	* src/mged/rtif.c, src/mged/usepen.c:
	simplify, use MAT_DELTAS_VEC_NEG when setting translation elements to 
negative vector values

	* src/mged/chgmodel.c, src/mged/edsol.c, src/proc-db/common.c, 
src/proc-db/kurt.c, src/proc-db/tube.c:

	* include/vmath.h:

modifying the translation elements (3, 7, 11) in a 4x4 transformation matrix

	* src/librt/dg_obj.c:

	* TODO:
	add support for arbitrary matrix transformations to torus primitive .. 
while there's certainly question on what this means to the mathematics of the 
implicit form (they're no longer mathematically a torus), the underlying 
modeling capacity is still needed and storing a transformation matrix or at 
least scaling vectors in the primitive (or above the primitive) would go a long 
way to handling this somewhat unique case.

2007-01-25  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	whoops, that was just testing on the opt/optimized. go ahead and add an 
alias for enable-opt anyways.

2007-01-24  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_grip.c:
	seems to be a header that didn't update correctly -- accept implicit 
assignment of copyright via former brl-cad agreement, while retaining 
authorship details even though GSI is sadly now defunct.

	* src/librt/importFg4Section.c:
	copyright was acquired (by non-gov't) and later assigned to the 
government prior to open sourcing.  remove old clause

	* configure.ac: stray "

	* TODO:
	add an entire new section for documentation, listing various documents 
that are written or planned.  include notes and status for some that are 
already completed but perhaps not yet in CVS

	* configure.ac:
	similarly disable opengl/wgl checks if they are disabled via arg

	* configure.ac:
	clarify the license detail that this particular file, as part of the 
build system, is BSD licensed.  the lgpl was used before since this file is 
often encountered first, but instead use the correct header and include a note 
about how the license applied, referring to COPYING for more details.

	* configure.ac:
	similarly disable all the java checks if we're --without-java

	* configure.ac:
	restructure the X11 checks so that if --without-x11 is provided, all of 
the associated x11 checks are also disabled as well so we don't waste time 
testing for things that will not be used.  similarly, don't auto-add /usr/X11R6 
to the search paths or add the extra restart paths unless we're in automatic or 
yes mode

2007-01-24  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	Add another X11 test to verify that the X11 library is actually linking 
in.

2007-01-23  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librtserver/rtserver.c:
	Java Partition objects now include entrance and exit surface normals

2007-01-23  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS:
	write up a summary of the recent sweeping license changes. i.e. 
describe gpl->lgpl and gfdl/gpl->bdl as well as the motvations, impact, and 
intent.

2007-01-23  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs.dsp:
	ignore opennurbs_zlib_memory.cpp in win32-msvc build
	we do not need the openNURBS wrapper functions zcalloc() and zcfree() 
since we're just letting zlib do it's own thing

	* src/other/libregex/libregex.dsp: not a BRL-CAD core library

	Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD 
Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and 
BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL 
and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the 
FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms 
and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their 
purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries 
without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

	ugh, what tedium.  put some effort towards cleaning up the doxygen 
labels and making the headers more consistent.  also exclusively using @ for 
doxygen instead of \ to try to keep things more consistent.

	* src/libfb/if_ap.c:
	dept of energy is part of the u.s. government and while there ability 
to claim copyright back in '89 is dubious, since they are government they can 
fall under the same significant conversion and copyright assignment conditions 
that was initially required.  so either way, the header can be cleaned up.

	* src/libfb/if_X24.c:
	header cleanup, happens to be a sun file, so integrate the bsd-style 
license proper.

	* src/conv/patch/pull_comp.sh, src/conv/patch/pull_solidsub.sh:
	add bsd headers to helper scripts

	standard header and footer cleanup

	* src/adrt/bench/bench.c, src/adrt/bench/bench.h, src/adrt/bench/main.c:
	standard header and footer

	* src/adrt/scripts/shiva.sh, src/adrt/scripts/drawBSP.py, 
src/adrt/scripts/makemovie.pl, src/adrt/scripts/ptcloud.c, 
src/adrt/scripts/ptcloud.py, src/adrt/scripts/adrt.py:
	apply the standard header and footer, more to come

	* sh/header.sh:
	recognize arbitrary script exec identifier lines, regardless of 
/usr/bin, /bin, etc

2007-01-20  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sh/footer.sh, sh/header.sh: add recognition of python

	* sh/prior.psql:
	remove the unnecessary script -- directly embedded into prior.sh now

	* sh/prior.sh:
	add header and footer; embed the psql sql statement directly

	* sh/Makefile.am: prior.sh missing from dist

	* sh/indent.sh:
	add support similar to that added to copyright.sh that allows the 
script to also work on individual files or with find.  the script now also 
processes a backup just in case there are no changes made.

	* sh/copyright.sh: rm -f

	* sh/copyright.sh: init var safety

	* sh/Makefile.am, sh/ldAix.sh:
	remove obsolete ldAix.sh build helper script.  it's libtool's job now.

	* sh/gforge.sh, sh/facetall.sh: header and footer

	* misc/macosx/Resources/License.rtf, misc/win32-msvc/Dll/brlcad.rc, 
misc/win32-msvc/vers.vbs:
	consistency on the (c), keep it simple

	* sh/Makefile.am, sh/cakeinclude.sh:
	obsolete script from prior build system

	* misc/win32-msvc/Dll/TclDummies.c: header cleanup

	* bench/viewdiff.sh:
	header should say viewdiff.sh since it was renamed, not recheck.sh

	* sh/copyright.sh:
	clean up the progress printing a little bit, remove the sed duplication 
and false modification report on current-year copyrighted files. ws too.

	* sh/copyright.sh:
	oop, the dotfiles thing caused automatic to go all empty list crazy.  
remove that contraint, but add a slew of other exemptions of stuff it should be 
able to safely ignore

	* doc/html/manuals/mged/Makefile.am, doc/html/manuals/mged/cup, 
doc/html/manuals/mged/cup.sh, doc/html/manuals/mged/mged.html, 
doc/html/manuals/mged/mged1.html:
	it's a shell script, so call it cup.sh instead for consistency

	* sh/copyright.sh:
	add support to detect/convert \a9 copyright symbols, convert them to 
(c) for consistency just like everything else. also, more importantly, add the 
ability to use this script to process individual files (e.g. in conjunction 
with find).  if there's an argument list, that is what will be processed.  
otherwise, it will do the usual task of processing everything under the src 
root that it recognizes (and that isn't exempted).

	* misc/win32-msvc/Dll/brlcad.rc:
	copyright on the whole starts back in 1984

2007-01-20  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc/win32-msvc/Dll/TclDummies.c, misc/win32-msvc/Dll/brlcad.rc, 
misc/win32-msvc/vers.vbs, src/gtools/g_qa.1, misc/brlcad.spec.in, 
misc/macosx/Resources/License.rtf:
	update copyright to 2007

	* sh/header.sh:
	use dates formatting to extract the year instead of awk...

	initialize the lists, so it doesn't error if there was no header or

	* src/tclscripts/ami.tcl, src/tclscripts/ampi.tcl:
	for ease of (cvs diff) comparisons and review -- and since they are 
presently stored in CVS for Windows build convenience -- sort the contents of 
the tclIndex and pkgIndex.tcl files (taking the comment header into account)

	* src/rttherm/Makefile.am:
	use the EXCEPTIONS value as a LDFLAG so that we get -fexceptions here 
when compiling with the gcc compiler and using the new openNURBS library.  
unclear why we only get the __Unwind_Resume symbol error on only rttherm and 
not any other binaries.

	* configure.ac:
	this fixes another compilation/linking issues involving the new C++ 
openNURBS library integration. added is a check for the -fexceptions gcc 
compiler/linker flag that takes care of an unresolved __Unwind_Resume symbol 
error when linking rttherm (quite odd that only rttherm seems to provoke that 
symbol being undefined).  the symbol relates to exception handling support in 
gcc that would otherwise be provided if linking with g++.  could also have 
probably added the -shared-libgcc flag as well for the same result.  thanks to 
Andrew Pinski for this particular fix.

	* configure.ac:
	this fixes a compilation/linking issue involving the new C++ openNURBS 
library integration.  it accounts for bad behavior in pre 1.5.8 libtool where 
the generated libtool script would contain an -all_load directive on the linker 
line for libraries that use convenience libraries as part of the 
whole_archive_flag_spec.  that flag in turn causes gcc to fail with various 
errors on duplicate standard math and io symbols.  the libtool script is simply 
stripped of the -all_load directive, which causes libtool to correctly just 
include all the convenience libraries and link the objects manually.  this 
problem was specific to the default libtool (1.5) provided on mac os x (10.4).

	* m4/compiler.m4:
	add an option, a third parameter, that if set to anything will inform 
the macro to not keep the flag as a CFLAG/LDFLAG/etc leaving it up to the user 
to do something with the provided bc_[param2]_works variable

	* src/rt/do.c, NEWS:
	awesome.. not only did karel (aka clock3) identify and report on an 
animation bug in rt with extensive detail, he went on to trace down the problem 
and actually identified the bug.  a variable that keeps track of frame progress 
was not being reset to null after a frame was completed causing subsequent 
frames to dereference an invalid pointer and segfault.  apply the fix from sf 
bug 1629285 (persistent segfaults during animation - with a fix). this affected 
all raytracers, but not library users.  excellent work, karel.  excellent.

	* src/rt/main.c:

checking to see if openNURBS is already installed on the system or not so that 
auto as default will work.

	initial import of the openNURBS initiative's nurbs toolkit.  the 
toolkit consists of code for reading/writing .3dm files used by Rhino as well 
as nurbs evaluation and other geometry processing facilities.  the library is 
being evaluated for .3dm support as well as potentially gutting the existing 
nurbs primitive and using openNURBS evaluation routines instead (still probably 
need to implement ray shot evaluation).  this is version 200612050 (aka 4.0).

	this is also a C++ library, the first integration of an external C++ 
dependency into BRL-CAD.  additional support/infrastructure will be needed to 
support this in configure.  there's still, however, a policy/convention of 
"containment" so that C++ does not propagate into the existing BRL-CAD 
libraries.  any additions that utilize c++ still have to be entirely modular 
(and optional) for the time being.

	* BUGS:
	tgc reports one hit errors though hit point has 0,0,0 direction 
implying that maybe the point was supposedly deleted

2006-12-29  lbutler  <lbutler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/bu.h, include/machine.h, include/raytrace.h:
	raytrace and bu got comment updates
	machine.h now supports dual cpu's on Intel based Mac machines

	* src/librtserver/rtserver.c:
	shootray method now sets ray index to zero to avoid confusion with 
bundle rays

2006-12-15  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc/win32-msvc/Dll/brlcad.def:
	Changed smooth_bot to bot_smooth inorder to match other bot commands 
and functions.
	(mjgillich)

2006-12-12  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS:
	mged help command now shows help for all args listed.  this fixes a bug 
with the 'help' command where issuing something like 'helpdevel aip hist' would 
report the non-existance of the 'aip hist' command.  now correctly returns the 
help for all listed individually as was documented.  this issue was reported by 
an analyst at arl.

	* src/tclscripts/helpcomm.tcl, src/tclscripts/mged/help.tcl:
	fix an mged bug in the various help commands so that they actually work 
with more than one command listed (as their own help messages implied they were 
capable of).  affects help, helplib, and helpdevel which now take zero, one, or 
more command names.

	* src/librt/bool.c:
	the comments around the conditional were entirely unintentional.. from 
the rt_g.debug to RT_G_DEBUG change that was made in 2001.  it's just taken 
this long before someone actually tried to shoot a bundle of rays with librt 
(or at least this long for someone to complain about the verbose blather)

	* src/external/Cubit/Makefile.am:
	initial Makefile for g-sat convertor. Has lib paths hard-coded, needs 
work to be configurable.

	* src/external/Cubit/g-sat.cxx:
	BRL-CAD to ACIS (export) convertor for importing to CUBIT (1st version) 
-- needs review and cleanup but fully functional

	* configure.ac:
	added check for C++ compiler and override default flags to nothing

2006-12-07  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	update that moves towards a unified project agnostic script.  the 
project name is now pulled from the configure template instead of necessarily 
being embedded in here.  allow overrides on the CONFIGURE template and the 
PROJECT name via env vars.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Disable component picking if NOT in BRLCAD mode.

2006-11-10  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO:
	add a make target and/or an update script for facilitating the release 
process.

	* autogen.sh:
	add a check during manual configuration for whether the gbs is even 
used, i.e. whether a configure template is found so that we can abort more 
cleanly early

2006-11-05  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

2006-10-20  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/edsol.c: some (not very stable or complete) metaball editing

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	More print capability. Fixed missing magic in st_specific.

2006-10-17  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac, include/config_win.h:
	prepare for release 7.8.4, standard updates

	* NEWS:
	prepare for release, numbering it 7.8.4 as planned even though it's 
borderline 7.10 feature-wise.  last news item, doug howard added (via bob) 
support for handling larger hierarchies in archer.
