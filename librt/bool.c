 *	In particular, copying a garbage hit_point from a structure which

 *
 *  Consider each partition on the sorted & woven input partition list.
 *  If the partition ends before this box's start, discard it immediately.
 *  If the partition begins beyond this box's end, return.
 *
 *  Next, evaluate the boolean expression tree for all regions that have
 *  some presence in the partition.
 *
 * If 0 regions result, continue with next partition.
 * If 1 region results, a valid hit has occured, so transfer
 * the partition from the Input list to the Final list.
 * If 2 or more regions claim the partition, then an overlap exists.
 * If the overlap handler gives a non-zero return, then the overlapping
 * partition is kept, with the region ID being the first one encountered.
 * Otherwise, the partition is eliminated from further consideration. 
 *
 *  All partitions in the indicated range of the ray are evaluated.
 *  All partitions which really exist (booleval is true) are appended
 *  to the Final partition list.
 *  All partitions on the Final partition list have completely valid
 *  entry and exit information, except for the last partition's exit
 *  information when a_onehit!=0 and a_onehit is odd.
 *
 *  The flag a_onehit is interpreted as follows:
 *
 *  If a_onehit = 0, then the ray is traced to +infinity, and all
 *  hit points in the final partition list are valid.
 *
 *  If a_onehit != 0, the ray is traced through a_onehit hit points.
 *  (Recall that each partition has 2 hit points, entry and exit).
 *  Thus, if a_onehit is odd, the value of pt_outhit.hit_dist in
 *  the last partition may be incorrect;  this should not mater because
 *  the application specifically said it only wanted pt_inhit there.
 *  This is most commonly seen when a_onehit = 1, which is useful for
 *  lighting models.  Not having to correctly determine the exit point
 *  can result in a significant savings of computer time.
 *  If a_onehit is negative, it indicates the number of non-air hits needed.
 *
 *  Returns -
 *	0	If more partitions need to be done
 *	1	Requested number of hits are available in FinalHdp
 *
 *  The caller must free whatever is in both partition chains.
