 * To use the compilied header you need to set the "Prefix file" in
 * the "C/C++ Language" preference panel to point to the created
 * compilied header.  The name of the header depends on the
 * architecture we are compiling for (see the code below).  For
 * example, for a 68k app the prefix file should be: MW_TclHeader68K.
