.SH NAME
lappend \- Append list elements onto a variable
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlappend \fIvarName \fR?\fIvalue value value ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command treats the variable given by \fIvarName\fR as a list
and appends each of the \fIvalue\fR arguments to that list as a separate
element, with spaces between elements.
If \fIvarName\fR doesn't exist, it is created as a list with elements
given by the \fIvalue\fR arguments.
\fBLappend\fR is similar to \fBappend\fR except that the \fIvalue\fRs
are appended as list elements rather than raw text.
This command provides a relatively efficient way to build up
large lists.  For example, ``\fBlappend a $b\fR'' is much
more efficient than ``\fBset a [concat $a [list $b]]\fR'' when
\fB$a\fR is long.
