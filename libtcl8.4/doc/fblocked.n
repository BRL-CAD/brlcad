.SH NAME
fblocked \- Test whether the last input operation exhausted all available input
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfblocked \fIchannelId\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBfblocked\fR command returns 1 if the most recent input operation
on \fIchannelId\fR returned less information than requested because all
available input was exhausted.
For example, if \fBgets\fR is invoked when there are only three
characters available for input and no end-of-line sequence, \fBgets\fR
returns an empty string and a subsequent call to \fBfblocked\fR will
return 1.
.PP
.VS
\fIChannelId\fR must be an identifier for an open channel such as a
Tcl standard channel (\fBstdin\fR, \fBstdout\fR, or \fBstderr\fR),
the return value from an invocation of \fBopen\fR or \fBsocket\fR, or
the result of a channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension.
