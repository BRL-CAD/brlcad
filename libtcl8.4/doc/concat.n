.SH NAME
concat \- Join lists together
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBconcat\fI \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command joins each of its arguments together with spaces after
trimming leading and trailing spaces from each of them.  If all the
arguments are lists, this has the same effect as concatenating them
into a single list.
It permits any number of arguments.  For example, the command
.CS
\fBconcat a b {c d e} {f {g h}}\fR
.CE
will return
.CS
\fBa b c d e f {g h}\fR
.CE
as its result, and
.CS
\fBconcat " a b {c   " d "  e} f"\fR
.CE
will return
.CS
\fBa b {c d e} f\fR
.CE
as its result.
.PP
If no \fIarg\fRs are supplied, the result is an empty string.
