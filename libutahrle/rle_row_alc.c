 * Allocate buffer space for use by rle_getrow and rle_putrow.
 * Inputs:
 * 	the_hdr:	Header structure for RLE file to be read or
 *			written.
 * Outputs:
 *	scanp:		Pointer to pointer to created scanline buffer.
 *			This pointer is adjusted for the alpha channel,
 *			if present.
 *	Returns 0 for success, -1 if malloc failed.
 * Assumptions:
 * 	No input scanline will extend beyond the declared xmax endpoint.
 * Algorithm:
 *	Count number of channels actually used (check bitmap).
 * 	Allocate nchan*rowlength pixels, allocate a buffer
 *	to hold ncolors+alpha pointers, and give each channel
 *	rowlength pixels.  Rowlength is xmax + 1, to allow for rle_getrow
 *	usage.
