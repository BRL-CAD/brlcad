.SH NAME
rle_open_f \- Open a binary file for input or output with defaults.
.br
rle_open_f_noexit \- Returns error code instead of exiting.
.SH SYNOPSIS

FILE *rle_open_f( prog_name, file_name, mode )
.br

char *prog_name, *file_name, *mode;

FILE *rle_open_f_noexit( prog_name, file_name, mode )

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.I rle_open_f
is provided to simplify the task of opening files in toolkit programs.
It works similarly to 
.IR fopen (3),
but it also provides error checking and messages, and default values
for input and output.  If the specified 
.I file_name
cannot be opened, an error message is printed and the program exits.
A variant
.I rle_open_f_noexit
is provided which will return NULL if the file cannot be opened.  An
error message is still printed.

On those systems which require it, a 'b' will be appended to the mode
string so that the file will be opened in binary mode.

If the 
.I file_name
is NULL or "\-", then 
.I stdin
will be returned for input (\fImode\fR "r") files and
.I stdout
will be returned for output (\fImode\fR "w" or "a") files.  

.I 
The following two options are available only on systems supporting pipes.
If the 
.I file_name
starts with a "|" character, then the rest of the file name will be
taken as a 
.IR sh (1)
command.  If 
.I mode
is "r", a pipe from the output of the
.I sh
command will be returned.  If
.I mode
is "w" or "a", a pipe to the input of the
.I sh
command will be returned.

If the
.I file_name
ends with the suffix ".Z" (and does not start with "|"), then the 
.IR compress (1)
program will be invoked to uncompress (\fImode\fR "r") or compress
(\fImode\fR "w" or "a") the file.  The file descriptor returned by
.I rle_open_f
will be a pipe from or to the compress program.

.IR popen (3),
.IR compress (1).

.SH BUGS
If the command invoked via \fIpopen\fR does not exist, the \fIpopen\fR
still returns successfully, and the underlying \fIsh\fR prints an
error message.
 
There is no way of telling that a particular \fIFILE\fP pointer has
been created by \fIpopen\fP, so it isn't possible to cleanly close the
pipe with \fIpclose\fP.  In fact, the eventual output file may not
even exist by the time the program exits.
