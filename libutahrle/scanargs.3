.SH NAME
scanargs, qscanargs - formatted conversion from command argument list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <stdio.h>"
.PP
.B "scanargs(argc, argv, format" 
[, pointer]...
.B )
.br
.B "int argc;"
.br
.B "char *argv[];"
.br
.B "char *format;"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Scanargs
reads
.I argc
arguments from an argument list pointed to by
.I argv.
It converts the argument list according to the format string,
and stores the results of the conversions in its parameters.
.PP
Scanargs expects as its parameters an argument count
.I argc,
a pointer to an argument list 
.I argv
(see 
.IR exec (2)),
a control string
.I format,
described below, and a set of
.I pointer
arguments indicating where the converted output should be stored.
.PP
The control string contains specifications, which are used to direct
interpretation of argument sequences.  It contains
the necessary information to describe an acceptable 
syntax for the argument list, and the expected meaning of each argument.
.PP
If the scanning fails it will print a cryptic 
message telling why it failed, and generate a 
.I usage
message from the control string.
.PP
The control string is composed of two parts:
.PP
.B Name:\ \ 
The first characters in the string are assumed to be the calling 
name of the program being executed. This is used for generation of
usage messages, but is otherwise ignored.
If this field is a % sign, it is replaced with the contents of
.IR argv [0]
in the message.
.PP
.B Conversions:\ \ 
Following the name, an optional list of conversion specifications is given,
with separating spaces.  The structure of a conversion specification:
.RS
.PP
.B "label_key_conversion"
.RE
.PP
consists of a
.I label
which is a string of non-space characters describing the acceptable
argument, a
.I key
which may be either of
.TP 4
.B %
The argument is optional. Its absence is ignored.
.TP 4 
.B !
A required argument. If absent, an error return ensues.
.PP
The
.I conversion
character indicates the interpretation of the argument; the corresponding
pointer parameter must be of a restricted type.
.PP
The following conversion characters are supported:
.TP 4
.B d D
a decimal integer is expected; the corresponding parameter should be an 
.I int
or a
.I long
(if
.B D
is specified) pointer.
.TP 4
.B o O
an octal integer is expected; the corresponding parameter should be an 
.I int
or a
.I long
pointer.
.TP 4
.B x X
a hexadecimal integer is expected; the corresponding parameter should be an 
.I int
or a
.I long
pointer.
.TP 4
.B n N
an integer numeric conversion using 
.I C
language syntax.  Numbers beginning 
.B 0x
are hexadecimal, numbers beginning
.B 0
are octal, and other numbers are decimal.  Negative hex numbers must have
the minus sign
.I following
the
.BR 0x ,
i.e. negative 0xa would be given as 0x\-a.  The corresponding pointer
should point to an
.I int
or a
.I long.
.TP 4
.B f F
a floating point number is expected; the corresponding parameter should
be a pointer to a
.I float
or a
.I double.
.TP 4
.B s
a character string is expected; the corresponding parameter should be the
address of a pointer to
.I char.
.TP 4
.B \-
a single character flag is expected; the corresponding parameter should
be an 
.I int
pointer.  The occurrence of a
.B \-
followed by the character specified in the label
will cause the setting of the least significant bit of the integer pointed to 
by the corresponding parameter.  The label may consist of up to sixteen
(actually, up to the number of bits in an \fIint\fP) option
characters, in which case one of the bits of the integer is independently
set to reflect which one of the flags was present. (The right most character
corresponds to the LSB of the integer)  Only one option may be chosen from
each conversion specification.  The bits which are not set will remain in
their previous state.  For example, a specification of 
.B abc%\-
would match one of
.B \-a \-b
or
.B \-c
in the argument list. 
.B \-c
would cause the corresponding variable to be set to 1, 
.B \-b
to 2, and
.B \-a
to 4.  (Actually, these bits would be ored in, but assuming an initial value
of 0, this is true).
.PP
.RS 4
The
.B \-
may be followed immediately by more label_key_conversion specifications.
These should not be separated by blanks and should not contain any
.B \-
specifications.  They will be processed only if the flag argument is scanned.
This allows optional specification of parameters corresponding to a flag
(e.g.
.I \-f file
).  Corresponding arguments on the command line must appear between the flag
which introduces them and the next flag in the command line.
.RE
.TP 4
.B $
This may appear only as the last specifier in the format string, and is used
to "eat up" the rest of the command arguments.  The corresponding function
argument is an
.I int
pointer.  An index into
.I argv
to the dividing point between the arguments which have been used, and those
which have not is returned.  This index points to the first unused command
argument.  If there is no such dividing point, an error
will be generated (but \fB$\fP may match zero arguments, as long as
the entire set of arguments has already been matched).
.PP
A string or numeric conversion character may be preceded by a
`\fB*\fP' or a `\fB,\fP' to indicate that a list of such arguments is
expected.  If `\fB,\fP' is used, then the AT&T proposed argument
standard is followed, and a single string is expected, with the
individual list elements separated by commas or spaces.  Two commas in
a row will produce a null entry (0 if numeric, zero-length string if
string conversion), but multiple spaces, and spaces following a comma,
are taken as a single separator.  If
`\fB*\fP'
is specified, then multiple arguments are parsed to produce the list.  A
format specifier with a
`\fB*\fP'
or a
`\fB,\fP'
takes two arguments.  The first is an
.B int
pointer, the number of items in the list is returned here.  The second is a
pointer to pointer to the correct data type for the format specifier.  A
pointer to the list of arguments is returned here.
.PP
The scanner will process the control string from left to right,
and where there are multiple conversions of the same type, they will
be assigned one to one with their order of occurrence in the argument list.
Where the order of the arguments is not ambiguous in the control string,
they may occur in any order in the argument list. (ie. A decimal number
will not be confused with a flag, but may
be confused with an octal number or another decimal number. So if an
octal and a decimal number are to be arguments, their order will determine
their conversion, while a decimal number and a flag as arguments may occur
in any order and still be converted correctly.)
.PP
An argument list that does not match the requirements of the control
string will cause the printing of a short message telling why, and
a message telling what the correct usage is.
This usage is gleaned from the control string, and the labels are used
directly.  The labels should be both terse and descriptive!  Spaces, tabs,
and newlines in the format string will be reproduced in the usage message,
and can be used for effective prettyprinting.  A single tab (following a
newline) will indent the line directly under the command name in the usage
message.
.PP
The
.I scanargs
function returns 1 when the argument list matched the requirements
of the control string, and returns 0 if there was a failure.
Parameters for any conversions not matched are left untouched.
.br
For example, the call
.RS
.PP
int i; double x; char *name;
.br
scanargs(argc, argv, "% decimal%d floating%F file%s",
.in 15
&i, &x, &name );
.RE
.PP
in a C program executed by the shell command
.RS
.PP
.I %
program 10 3.5397 inputfile
.RE
.PP
will assign to 
.I i
the value 10, 
.I x
the value 3.5397, and
.I name
will point to the string "inputfile".
.PP
If the program was executed by the shell command
.RS
.PP
.I %
program  3.4 .7 inputfile
.RE
.PP
the following would be printed on the standard error:
.RS
.PP
extra arguments not processed
.br
usage : program [decimal] [floating] [file]
.RE
.PP
because 3.4 matches the type of 'floating' and .7 matches
the type of 'file', leaving inputfile unmatched.
.PP
Finally, executing the command
.RS
.br
.I %
program 10
.RE
.br
would assign 10 to 
.IR i ,
leaving
.I x
and
.I name
unaffected.
.PP
This call could be used for the 
.IR diff (1)
command
.RS
.PP
int blanks; int flags; char *file1; char *file2;
.br
scanargs(argc, argv, "diff b%\- efh%\- file1!s file2!s",
.in 15
&blanks, &flags, &file1, &file2 );
.RE
.PP
and would only allow one of either 
.BR \-e ", " \-f ,
or
.B \-h
to be chosen optionally, with 
.B \-b 
as an independent option.
.B File1
and
.B file2
are both required.
The usage message for this version of
.I diff
would be
.RS
.PP
usage : diff [\-b] \-{efh} file1 file2
.RE

This call could be used for a simplified version of the
.IR sed (1)
command
.RS
.PP
int efile; int noprint; char *script; 
.br
char *file1; char *file2;
.br
scanargs(argc, argv, 
.in 15
"sed n%\- f%\-editfile!s script%s file%s",
.in 15
&noprint, &efile, &file1, &script, &file2 );
.RE
.PP
If the
.B \-f
option is specified, then a file name must be given as the next string
argument.
The usage message for this version of
.I sed
would be
.RS
.PP
usage : sed [\-n] [\-f editfile] [script] file
.RE

Further notes on putting together a format string:
.PP
It is possible for conditional arguments to be confused with
arguments which stand alone.  For this reason, it is recommended that
all flags (and associated conditional arguments) be specified first in
the scanargs format string.  This ordering is not necessary for the
command line arguments, however.  The only case which could still cause
confusion if these rules are followed is illustrated below:
.br
.RS
format string:	"prog d%\-num%d othernum%d"
.br
command line:	prog \-d 9
.RE
.br
It is unclear whether the number 9 should be associated with the 
.I num
parameter or the
.I othernum
parameter.  
.I Scanargs 
assigns it to the
.I num
parameter.  To force it to be associated with
.I othernum
the
command could be invoked as either
.br
.RS
		prog 9 \-d
.br
or		prog \-d \-\^\- 9
.RE
.br
The 
.B \-\^\-
in the second example is interpreted as a flag, thereby
terminating the scan for arguments introduced by the 
.BR \-d .
According to the proposed standard, an argument of
.B \-\^\-
is to be interpreted as terminating the optional arguments on a flag.
.PP
Note that if the format string in the above example were
.br
.RS
		"prog othernum%d d%\-num%d"
.RE
.br
it would be impossible to assign a value to 
.I num
without also
assigning a value to 
.I othernum.
A command line of
.RS
	prog -d 9
.RE
would match \fIothernum\fP with 9, leaving nothing to match \fInum\fP.

By its nature a call to scanargs defines a syntax
which may be ambiguous, and although the results may be surprising, 
they are quite predictable.
