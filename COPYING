specification are covered by the terms of the LGPL.

Most of BRL-CAD's build infrastructure including files required by the
GNU Build System (such as the configure.ac and all Makefile.am files),
a variety of scripts located in the misc/ and sh/ directories, and the
testing infrastructure (scripts and resources) are provided either
