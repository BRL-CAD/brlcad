Overview
--------

BRL-CAD consists primarily of libraries, applications, scripts,
documentation, geometric models, images, data resources, and build
infrastructure.  The BRL-CAD libraries provide their headers in the
include/ directory as well as all of the directories that begin with
the prefix "lib" in the src/ directory (e.g. src/librt/).  All of
BRL-CAD's libraries, applications, and any content lacking a license
specification are covered by the terms of the LGPL.

Most of BRL-CAD's build infrastructure including files required by the
GNU Build System (such as the configure.ac and all Makefile.am files),
a variety of scripts located in the misc/ and sh/ directories, and the
testing infrastructure (scripts and resources) are provided either
under the BSD license or are in the public domain.  Similarly, most of
the geometric models, images, and other data resources are also
provided under the BSD license.  Refer to each individual file for
specific terms.

BRL-CAD's documentation consists of manual pages located throughout
the package, most of the files in the doc/ directory, and the
top-level administrative project text files (e.g. README & AUTHORS).
Unless otherwise denoted, all of BRL-CAD's documentation is made
available under the terms of the BSD Documentation License (BDL) or
are in the public domain.  Refer to each document for specific terms.

The full text of the LGPL, BDL, and BSD license should be included in
the source distribution of BRL-CAD in the doc/legal/ directory.  Refer
to the full license text for more details, information, requirements,
and implications of each license.

3rd-Party Components

redistribution and legal compatibility for all of BRL-CAD's existing
user base, NO 3RD PARTY LIBRARIES SHALL BE INCLUDED THAT ARE UNDER THE
TERMS OF THE GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE or any other license with
similar legal implications that would impose legal obligations on
external codes that utilize BRL-CAD as a library.
