 *  This header wraps the system-specific encapsulation of
 *  brlcad_config.h and removes need to conditionally include
 *  brlcad_config.h everywhere based on HAVE_CONFIG_H.  The common
 *  definitions are symbols common to the platform being built that
 *  are either detected via configure or hand crafted, as is the case
 *  for the win32 platform.
