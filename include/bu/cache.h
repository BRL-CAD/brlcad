/** @file cache.h

 * Routines for managing and accessing a key/value data store.
 *
 * NOTE:  Data backend storage is NOT guaranteed by this API from one BRL-CAD
 * version to the next. Older versions of libbu caches may use different
 * internal storage than newer ones.  Should a backend need to change, we will
 * strive to maintain support for reading in the previous backend when the new
 * one is released to allow for data migration.  However, cache data is
 * ultimately intended to be ephemeral and subject to regeneration - if the
 * maintenance burden of backwards compatibilty becomes too high the decision
 * will be made to drop support for reading older caches.
 *
 * For data that is canonical and not able to be regenerated from other sources
 * (such as geometry or user settings) bu_cache is not an appropriate storage
 * mechanism.
