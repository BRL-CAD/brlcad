/** @file vfont.h
 *
 * This header file describes the in-memory format used by the BRL-CAD
 * Package routines for manipulating fonts stored in the Berkeley
 * VFONT format.
 *
 * Note that the VFONT files are in the format found on a VAX -- no
 * conversion has been applied.
 *
 * Merely TARing or RCPing the VAX /usr/lib/vfont directory onto any
 * machine suffices to install the fonts.
 *
 * The VAX format of the fonts is invisible to software actually using
 * the fonts, except to be aware that bit zero in a byte of font data
 * is on the right hand side (lsb).
 *
 * The VAX declaration of the file is:
 *
 *	struct header {
 *		short magic;
 *		unsigned short size;
 *		short maxx;
 *		short maxy;
 *		short xtend;
 *	};
 *	struct dispatch {
 *		unsigned short addr;
 *		short nbytes;
 *		char up, down, left, right;
 *		short width;
 *	};
 *	char bits[header.size];
 *
 * The char fields up, down, left, and right in the VAX-version
 * of struct dispatch are signed.  Use the SXT macro to extend the sign.
 *
 * The actual bits array has the upper left corner of the bitmap in
 * the first byte.  Bits are scanned out of the bytes in a
 * left-to-right, top-to-bottom order (most decidedly non-VAX style).
 * Never seems to be any consistency in data formats.
 *
