 *   BU_ENCODE_OCTAL
 *   BU_ENCODE_XML
 *
 * More thoughts on encode/decode - the nature of "quoting" is going to
 * vary depending on the usage context and the language.  For some
 * applications, HEX or BASE64 may be appropriate.  For others (like
 * the problems with arbitrary strings in Tcl which initially motivated
 * these functions) such wholesale encoding is not needed and it is just
 * a subset of characters that must be escaped or otherwise identified.

 * Given the large set of possible scenarios, it definitely makes sense

 * variables (which may be NULL, depending on the encoding type) specifying
 * active characters (that need quoting) and an escape character (or
 * characters?  does it take more than one in some scenarios?  perhaps start
 * and end of escape strings would be the most general?)
 *
 * This probably makes sense as its own header given that is is really
 * a feature on top of vls rather than something integral to vls
 * itself - it would be workable (maybe even practical, if the final
 * length of the encoded data can be pre-determined) to just work with
 * char arrays: see bu_str_escape()
