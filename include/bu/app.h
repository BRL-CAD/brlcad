 * @brief
 * Routine to open a temporary file.

 * Create a temporary file.  The first readable/writable directory

 * directories followed by default system temp directories and
 * ultimately trying the current directory.
 *
 * The name of the temporary file will be copied into a user-provided
 * (filepath) buffer if it is a non-NULL pointer and of a sufficient
 * (len) length to contain the filename.
 *
 * This routine is guaranteed to return a new unique file or return
 * NULL on failure.  The file should be closed via fclose() when it is
 * no longer needed.  The temporary file will be automatically
 * unlinked on application exit.  It is the caller's responsibility to
 * set file access settings, preserve file contents, or destroy file
 * contents if the default behavior is non-optimal.
 *
 * The temporary file may no longer exist after a call to fclose(), so
 * do not close a handle until you are are done accessing it.  Calling
 * fileno()+dup()+fdopen() can obtain a second handle on an open file.
 *
 * This routine is NOT thread-safe.
 *
 * Typical Use:
 *
 * @code
 * FILE *fp;
 * char filename[MAXPATHLEN];
 * fp = bu_temp_file(&filename, MAXPATHLEN); // get a named temp file
 * ...
 * fclose(fp); // close the file when you're done
 * ...
 * fp = bu_temp_file(NULL, 0); // get an anonymous temp file
 * bu_fchmod(fileno(fp), 0777);
 * ...
 * rewind(fp);
 * while (fputc(0, fp) == 0);
 * fclose(fp);
