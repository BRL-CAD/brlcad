 *  @brief
 *  Functionality for processing operating system and geometry database path
 *  strings.
 *
 *  Routines in this header have no knowledge of the file system,
 *  beyond an awareness of the path separator in use in the working operating
 *  system environment. They will not check for the presence or absence of
 *  objects on disk or in a geometry database - they operate only on the the
 *  path string itself.  Any validation of the path is the responsibility of
 *  the caller.

/**
 * Given a string containing a hierarchical path, return a dynamic
 * string to the parent path.
 *
 * This function is similar if not identical to most dirname() BSD
 * system function implementations; but that system function cannot be
 * used due to significantly inconsistent behavior across platforms.
 *
 * This function always recognizes paths separated by a '/' (i.e.,
 * geometry paths) as well as whatever the native platform directory
 * separator may be.  It is assumed that all file and directory names
 * in the path will not contain a path separator, even if escaped.
 *
 * It is the caller's responsibility to bu_free() the pointer returned
 * from this routine.
 *
 * Examples of strings returned:
 *
 * Input String  | Output String
 * ------------- | -------------
 * /usr/dir/file | /usr/dir
 * /usr/dir/     | /usr
 * /usr/file     | /usr

 * these functions have been made mandatory instead of optional. *All* callers
 * *must* supply functions, even if the desired behavior is the "typical"
 * interaction with the operating system's filesystems.  This separates I/O
 * logic from the core "globbing" logic.
 *
 * In addition to the "usual" callback functions needed by alternative
 * directory implementations, bu_glob callers must also supply callbacks that
 * handle the interpretation of special characters such as '~' - while this has
 * a standard meaning on Unix-style operating systems, that meaning does not
 * translate directly to (for example) .g database hierarchies.
 *
 * Note that by default, a pattern with no matches will return an empty list
 * rather than the unevaluated wildcard (the current POSIX specified behaviour).
