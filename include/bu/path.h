 *
 * Typically being used for operating system and geometry database
 * path strings, routines in this header do NOT have knowledge of or
 * access the filesystem.  They will not check for the presence or

 * only on the the path string itself.  Any validation of the path is
 * the responsibility of the caller or other routines.

 * Given a string containing a hierarchical path, return a dynamic
 * string to the parent path.
 *
 * This function is similar if not identical to most dirname() BSD
 * system function implementations; but that system function cannot be
 * used due to significantly inconsistent behavior across platforms.
 *
 * This function always recognizes paths separated by a '/' (i.e.,
 * geometry paths) as well as whatever the native platform directory
 * separator may be.  It is assumed that all file and directory names
 * in the path will not contain a path separator, even if escaped.
 *
 * It is the caller's responsibility to bu_free() the pointer returned
 * from this routine.

/**
 * A libbu re-implementation of basename() for cross-platform
 * compatibility.
 *
 * Given a string containing a hierarchically delimited path (e.g.,
 * /path/to/file), determine the file name portion after the last path
 * separator.
 *
 * This function is similar to most basename() BSD system function
 * implementations; but that system function cannot be used due to
 * significantly inconsistent behavior across platforms, particularly
 * with respect to memory allocation and threading behavior.
 *
 * This function always recognizes paths separated by a '/' (i.e.,
 * geometry paths) as well as whatever the native platform directory
 * separator may be.  It is assumed that all file and directory names
 * in the path do not contain a path separator.  That is, there is
 * currently no support for escaped characters.
 *
 * It is the caller's responsibility to provide a basename buffer with
 * enough memory for a string with length at least strlen(path) + 1
 * (for terminating nul) characters as that is the maximum possible
 * basename size.  If the basename output argument is NULL, then
 * dynamic memory will be returned and the caller is responsible for
 * releasing memory (via bu_free()), otherwise the caller-provided
 * basename pointer is returned and managed by the caller accordingly.
 *
 * Examples of strings returned:
 *
 * Input String  | Output String
 * ------------- | -------------
 * /usr/dir/file | file
 * /usr/dir/     | dir
 * /usr/         | usr
