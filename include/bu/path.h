/** @addtogroup bu_path
 *
 *  @brief
 *  Functionality for processing operating system and geometry database path
 *  strings.
 *
 *  Routines in this header have no knowledge of the file system,
 *  beyond an awareness of the path separator in use in the working operating
 *  system environment. They will not check for the presence or absence of
 *  objects on disk or in a geometry database - they operate only on the the
 *  path string itself.  Any validation of the path is the responsibility of
 *  the caller.

/**
 * Given a string containing a hierarchical path, return a dynamic
 * string to the parent path.
 *
 * This function is similar if not identical to most dirname() BSD
 * system function implementations; but that system function cannot be
 * used due to significantly inconsistent behavior across platforms.
 *
 * This function always recognizes paths separated by a '/' (i.e.,
 * geometry paths) as well as whatever the native platform directory
 * separator may be.  It is assumed that all file and directory names
 * in the path will not contain a path separator, even if escaped.
 *
 * It is the caller's responsibility to bu_free() the pointer returned
 * from this routine.
 *
 * Examples of strings returned:
 *
 * Input String  | Output String
 * ------------- | -------------
 * /usr/dir/file | /usr/dir
 * /usr/dir/     | /usr
 * /usr/file     | /usr
