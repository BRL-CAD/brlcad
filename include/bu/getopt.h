/** @addtogroup bu_getopt
 * @brief
 * Special portable re-entrant version of getopt.
 *
 * Everything is prefixed with bu_, to distinguish it from the various
 * getopt routines found in libc.
 *
 * Important note -
 * If bu_getopt() is going to be used more than once, it is necessary
 * to reinitialize bu_optind=1 before beginning on the next argument
 * list.

 *
 * The 'ostr' option string may contain individual characters (e.g.,
 * "abc"), characters followed by a colon to indicate a required
 * argument (e.g., "a:bc", 'a' requires an argument, 'b' and 'c' do
 * not), and characters followed by two colons to indicate an optional
 * argument (e.g., "ab::c", 'b' may be followed by an argument, but
 * none require an argument).
 *
 * Returns -1 when the argument list is exhausted, otherwise it
 * returns the next known option character.  If bu_getopt() encounters
 * a character not found in ostr or if it detects a required missing
 * option argument, it returns `?' (question mark).  If ostr has a
 * leading `:' then a missing option argument causes `:' to be
 * returned instead of `?'.  In either case, the variable bu_optopt is
 * set to the character that caused the error.
