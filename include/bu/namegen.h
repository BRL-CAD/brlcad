/** @addtogroup bu_namegen
 * @brief
 * Sequential name generation.
 *
 * A problem frequently encountered when generating names is generating names
 * that are in some sense structured but avoid colliding.  For example, given a
 * geometry object named:
 *
 * engine_part.s
 *
 * an application wanting to make multiple copies of engine_part.s
 * automatically might want to produce a list of names such as:
 *
 * engine_part.s-1 engine_part.s-2 engine_part.s-3 ...
 *
 * However, it is equally plausible that the desired pattern might be:
 *
 * engine_part_001.s engine_part_002.s engine_part_003.s ...
 *
 * This module implements an engine for generating the "next" name in a
 * sequence, given a pattern and a state definition.  The state definition is
 * opaque to the user and is used internally to define a notion of current and
 * next names in the sequence.
 *
 * TODO - describe how to specify regex expressions for matching - will use ()
 * subexpressions.
 *
 * The caller may optionally specify incrementation behavior with an incrementer
 * specification string, which has the following form:
 *
 * minwidth:init:max:step[:left_sepchar:right_sepchar]
 *
 * In the case of spacing, init, min, max, and step a '0' always indicates default
 * unspecified behavior.  So, an incrementer specified as 0:0:0:0 would behave
 * as follows:
 *
 * spacing: standard printf handling of number value
 * init: from initial name string
 * max: LONG_MAX
 * step: 1
 *
 * The last two separator chars are optional - they may be specified
 * if the user wants to guarantee a separation between the active incremented
 * substring and its surroundings. For example, the following would prefix the
 * incrementer output with an underscore and add a suffix with a dash:
 *
 * 2:1:50:5:_:-
 *
 * If no specifier is passed in, bu_namegen will analyze the string to
 * determine the minimum width of the incrementer string.  So, for example,
 * engine_part-001.s would by default be incremented to engine_part-002.s.
