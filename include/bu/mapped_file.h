 *
 * Routines for sharing large read-only data files.
 *
 * Routines for sharing large read-only data files like height fields,
 * bit map solids, texture maps, etc.  Uses memory mapped files where
 * available.
 *
 * Each instance of the file has the raw data available as element
 * "buf".  If a particular application needs to transform the raw data
 * in a manner that is identical across all uses of that application
 * (e.g. height fields, EBMs, etc.), then the application should
 * provide a non-null "appl" string, to tag the format of the "apbuf".
 * This will keep different applications from sharing that instance of
 * the file.
 *
 * Thus, if the same filename is opened for interpretation as both an
 * EBM and a height field, they will be assigned different mapped file
 * structures, so that the "apbuf" pointers are distinct.

/**
 * @struct bu_mapped_file bu.h
 *
 * Structure for opening a mapped file.
 *
 * Each file is opened and mapped only once (per application, as
 * tagged by the string in "appl" field).  Subsequent opens require an
 * exact match on both strings.
 *
 * Before allocating apbuf and performing data conversion into it,
 * openers should check to see if the file has already been opened and
 * converted previously.
 *
 * When used in RT, the mapped files are not closed at the end of a
 * frame, so that subsequent frames may take advantage of the large
 * data files having already been read and converted.  Examples
 * include EBMs, texture maps, and height fields.
 *
 * For appl == "db_i", file is a ".g" database & apbuf is (struct db_i *).
