 *  - %V and %#V have been added as valid conversions. Both expect a pointer to

 *
 *    %V is comparable to %[^]. It instructs bu_vsscanf to read arbitrary

 *    %#V is comparable to %s. It instructs bu_vsscanf to skip leading
 *    whitespace, and then read characters from the source and store them in the
 *    vls buffer until the next whitespace character is encountered. The default
 *    maximum field width is infinity.
 *
 *  - 0 is always a valid field width for unsuppressed %c, %s, and %[...]
 *    conversions and causes '\0' to be written to the supplied char*
 *    argument.
 *
 *  - a/e/f/g and A/E/F/G are always synonyms for float conversion.
