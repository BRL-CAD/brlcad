 * @brief
 * BRL-CAD support library, error logging routines.
 *
 * Note that the user may provide his own logging routine, by replacing these
 * functions.  That is why this is in file of its own.  For example, LGT and
 * RTSRV take advantage of this.
 *
 * Here is an example of how to set up a custom logging callback.  While bu_log
 * presently writes to STDERR by default, this behavior should not be relied
 * upon and may be changed to STDOUT in the future without notice.
 *
 * @code
 * --- BEGIN EXAMPLE ---
 *
 * int log_output_to_file(void *data, void *str)
 * {
 *   FILE *fp = (FILE *)data;
 *   fprintf(fp, "LOG: %s", str);
 *   return 0;
 * }
 *
 * int main(int ac, char *av[])
 * {
 *   FILE *fp = fopen("whatever.log", "w+");
 *   bu_log_add_hook(log_output_to_file, (void *)fp);
 *   bu_log("Logging to file.\n");
 *   bu_log_delete_hook(log_output_to_file, (void *)fp);
 *   bu_log("Logging to stderr.\n");
 *   fclose(fp);
 *   return 0;
 * }

/**
 * Custom vsscanf which wraps the system sscanf, and is wrapped by bu_sscanf.
 *
 * bu_vsscanf differs notably from the underlying system sscanf in that:
 *
 *  - A maximum field width is required for unsuppressed %s and %[...]
 *    conversions. If a %s or %[...] conversion is encountered which does
 *    not include a maximum field width, the routine bombs in order to avoid
 *    an accidental buffer overrun.
 *
 *  - %V and %\#V have been added as valid conversions. Both expect a
 *    pointer to a struct bu_vls as their argument.
 *
 *    %V is comparable to %[^]. It instructs bu_vsscanf to read arbitrary
 *    characters from the source and store them in the vls buffer. The default
 *    maximum field width is infinity.
 *
 *    %\#V is comparable to %s. It instructs bu_vsscanf to skip
 *    leading whitespace, and then read characters from the source and
 *    store them in the vls buffer until the next whitespace character
 *    is encountered. The default maximum field width is infinity.
 *
 *  - 0 is always a valid field width for unsuppressed %c, %s, and %[...]
 *    conversions and causes '\0' to be written to the supplied char*
 *    argument.
 *
 *  - a/e/f/g and A/E/F/G are always synonyms for float conversion.
 *
 *  - The C99 conversions hh[diouxX], z[diouxX], and t[diouxX] are always
 *    supported.
 *
 * This routine has an associated test program named test_sscanf, which
 * compares its behavior to the system sscanf.

 *
 * Scanning fastf_t numbers with bu_sscanf() is difficult, because
 * doing so requires scanning to some intermediate type like double
 * and then assigning to the fastf_t variable to convert the value to
 * whatever type fastf_t really is.  This function makes it possible
 * to scan a series of fastf_t numbers separated by some character(s)
 * easily, by doing the required conversion internally to the
 * functions.  As series of delimiter characters will be skipped,
 * empty scan fields are not supported (e.g., "0.0,,0.0,1.0" will scan
 * as 3 fields, not 4 with the 2nd skipped).
 *
 * @param[out] c Returns number of characters scanned by the function
 * @param[in] src A source string to scan from, or NULL to read from stdin
 * @param[in] delim Any delimiter character(s) to skip between scan values

 * @param[out] ... Pointers to fastf_t for storing scanned values (optional)
