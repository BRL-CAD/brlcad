/**
 * Escapes an input string with preceding '\'s for any characters
 * defined in the 'expression' string.  The input string is written to the
 * specified output buffer of 'size' capacity.  The input and output
 * pointers may overlap or be the same memory (assuming adequate space
 * is available).  If 'output' is NULL, then dynamic memory will be
 * allocated and returned.
 *
 * The 'expression' parameter is a regular "bracket expression"
 * commonly used in globbing and POSIX regular expression character
 * matching.  An expression can be either a matching list (default) or
 * a non-matching list (starting with a circumflex '^' character).
 * For example, "abc" matches any of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
 * Specifying a non-matching list expression matches any character
 * except for the ones listed after the circumflex.  For example,
 * "^abc" matches any character except 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
 *
 * Backslash escape sequences are not allowed (e.g., \\t or \\x01) as
 * '\' will be matched literally.
 *
 * A range expression consists of two characters separated by a hyphen
 * and will match any single character between the two characters.
 * For example, "0-9a-c" is equivalent to "0123456789abc".  To match a
 * '-' dash literally, include it as the last or first (after any '^')
 * character within the expression.
 *
 * The expression may also contain named character classes but only
 * for ASCII input strings:
 *
 * [:alnum:] Alphanumeric characters: a-zA-Z0-9
 * [:alpha:] Alphabetic characters: a-zA-Z
 * [:blank:] Space and TAB characters
 * [:cntrl:] Control characters: ACSII 0x00-0X7F
 * [:digit:] Numeric characters: 0-9
 * [:graph:] Characters that are both printable and visible: ASCII 0x21-0X7E
 * [:lower:] Lowercase alphabetic characters: a-z
 * [:print:] Visible and space characters (not control characters): ASCII 0x20-0X7E
 * [:punct:] Punctuation characters (not letters, digits, control, or space): ][!"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@^_`{|}~-\
 * [:upper:] Uppercase alphabetic characters: A-Z
 * [:xdigit:] Hexadecimal digits: a-fA-F0-9
 * [:word:] (non-POSIX) Alphanumeric plus underscore: a-zA-Z0-9_
 *
 * A non-NULL output string is always returned.  This allows
 * expression chaining and embedding as function arguments but care
 * should be taken to free the dynamic memory being returned when
 * 'output' is NULL.
 *
 * If output 'size' is inadequate for holding the escaped input
 * string, bu_bomb() is called.
 *
 * Example:
 *   char *result;
 *   char buf[128];
 *   result = bu_str_escape("my fair lady", " ", buf, 128);
 *   :: result == buf == "my\ fair\ lady"
 *   result = bu_str_escape(buf, "\", NULL, 0);
 *   :: result == "my\\ fair\\ lady"
 *   :: buf == "my\ fair\ lady"
 *   bu_free(result, "bu_str_escape");
 *   result = bu_str_escape(buf, "a-zA-Z", buf, 128);
 *   :: result == buf == "\m\y\ \f\a\i\r\ \l\a\d\y"
 *
 * This function should be thread safe and re-entrant if the
 * input/output buffers are not shared (and strlen() is threadsafe).
