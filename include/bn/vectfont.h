/** @addtogroup bn_vfont

 *  @brief
 *  Terminal Independent Graphics Display Package.
 *
 *  Mike Muuss  July 31, 1978
 *
 *  This routine is used to plot a string of ASCII symbols
 *  on the plot being generated, using a built-in set of fonts
 *  drawn as vector lists.
 *
 *  Internally, the basic font resides in a 10x10 unit square.
 *  Externally, each character can be thought to occupy one square
 *  plotting unit;  the 'scale'
 *  parameter allows this to be changed as desired, although scale
 *  factors less than 10.0 are unlikely to be legible.
 *
 *  The vector font table here was provided courtesy of Dr. Bruce
 *  Henrikson and Dr. Stephen Wolff, US Army Ballistic Research
 *  Laboratory, Summer of 1978.  They had developed it for their
 *  remote Houston Instruments pen plotter package for the
 *  GE Tymeshare system.
 *
 *  Used by LIBPLOT3 and LIBRT for simple vector fonts.
 *
 *  Vector font definitions, for TIG-PACK fonts.
