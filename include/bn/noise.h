 *@brief
 * Robert Skinner's Perlin-style "Noise" function
 *
 * Results are in the range [-0.5 .. 0.5].  Unlike many
 * implementations, this function provides random noise at the integer
 * lattice values.  However this produces much poorer quality and
 * should be avoided if possible.
 *
 * The power distribution of the result has no particular shape,
 * though it isn't as flat as the literature would have one believe.

 *
 * The spectral properties of the result are in the APPROXIMATE range
 * [-1..1] Depending upon the number of octaves computed, this range
 * may be exceeded.  Applications should clamp or scale the result to
 * their needs.  The results have a more-or-less gaussian
 * distribution.  Typical results for 1M samples include:
 *
 * @li Min -1.15246
 * @li Max  1.23146
 * @li Mean -0.0138744
 * @li s.d.  0.306642
 * @li Var 0.0940295
 *
 * The function call pow() is relatively expensive.  Therefore, this
 * function pre-computes and saves the spectral weights in a table for
 * re-use in successive invocations.
