 * Tessellation (geometric) tolerances, different beasts than the
 * calculation tolerance in bn_tol.

 * norm - angle between adjacent sampling normals may be no greater than norm degrees
 * absmax - triangle edge must be no larger than length abs
 * absmin - triangle edge may be no smaller than length absmin
 * relmax - triangle edge must be no larger than rel % of object bbox diagonal len
 * relmin - triangle edge may be no smaller than relmin % of object bbox diagonal len.
 * relfacemax - triangle edge must be no larger than rel % of the smaller of
 *   the two bbox diagonal lengths of the faces associated with the edge (edge
 *   curves) or the bbox diagonal length of the current face (surfaces)
 * relfacemin - triangle edge may be no smaller than rel % of the smaller of
 *   the two bbox diagonal lengths of the faces associated with the edge (edge
 *   curves) or the bbox diagonal length of the current face (surfaces)
 *
 * For the min parameters, they will be specified with the caveot that any surface
 * will have at least one midpt breakdown (more for closed surfaces), even if that
 * produces smaller triangles than mins specifies.  I.e. the min lengths are a
 * goal, but not an absolute guarantee.  Triangle aspect ratio constraints will
 * also override these parameters.
 *
 * With the above caveot, the first limit hit of any set limits will hault refinement.
 * Need to track go/no-go refinement decisions so we can report on what the important
 * parameters are for a given operation - this will give users some idea of how to
 * modify settings to change behavior.
 *
 * For the max parameters, we may need to warn on objects where they would produce
 * a huge number of triangles if tiny maxes are specified - this is generally not
 * user intent and will not work in extreme cases due to resource exhaustion.
 *
 * All triangles must satisfy an aspect ratio parameter (smallest height may be no less than
 * .1x the longest edge length) to prevent wildly distorted triangles.)  For triangles near
 * edges, surface points may be removed if necessary to satisfy this criteria.
 *
 * All operations must satisfy above criteria first.  Additional constraints are
 * defined below.  These are intended, among other things, to prevent aspect ratio
 * problems when extremely long edge segments and fine surface meshes combine to
 * produce extremely distorted triangles near edges):
 *
 * For non-linear edges, max edge seg len may be no greater than 5x the smallest
 * avg line segment length of any non-linear edge breakdowns in either loop
 * associated with that edge.  This will require a two-pass operation - an initial
 * breakdown of all non-linear edge curves, and a refinement pass to break down
 * those segments which don't meet the above criteria.
 *
 * For linear edges, max edge seg len may be no greater than 10x the smallest
 * avg line segment length of any non-linear edge breakdowns in either
 * loop associated with that edge.  This will require a third edge pass, once
 * the above curved edge breakdown is complete.
 *
 * For any surface, max edge length may be no greater than .1 times the shorter
 * of the surface's length/width (we shrink surfaces so this number has
 * some relation to the trimmed face size).
 *
 * For a non-planar surface, max edge length may be no greater than 10 times the
 * shortest average line segment length in the face's loops' edges (curved or
 * linear). (e.g.  triangles in curved surfaces may not be enormously large
 * compared to the edges' fidelity.)  We don't impose this restriction on
 * planar surfaces on the theory that any valid CDT will accurate represent the
 * surface, so we don't need to enforce any particular edge length on interior
 * triangles.  However...
