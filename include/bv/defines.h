 * NEXT STEPS:  get a selection set for the view organized, add commands that
 * allow the view2 command to create(view) and select (view or solid) objects,
 * and figure out how to allow per-object xy handling callbacks.  (The latter
 * will probably in the end be how we implement primitive editing as well...)
 *
 * Test case will be the polygon circle - create and resize.  May want to

/* bv_scene_groups (one level above scene objects, conceptually equivalent
 * to display_list) are used to capture the intent of drawing commands.  For
 * example, in the scenario where a draw command is used to visualize a comb
 * with sub-combs a and b:
 *
 * ged> draw comb
 *
 * The drawing code will check the proposed group against existing groups,
 * adding and removing accordingly.  It will then walk the hierarchy and create
 * bv_scene_obj instances for all solids below comb/a and comb/b as children
 * of the scene group.  Note that since we specified "comb" as the drawn
 * object, if comb/b is removed from comb and comb/c is added, we would expect
 * comb's displayed view to be updated to reflect its current structure.  If,
 * however, we instead did the original visualization with the commands:
 *
 * ged> draw comb/a
 * ged> draw comb/b
 *
 * The same solids would be drawn, but conceptually the comb itself is not
 * drawn - the two instances are.  If comb/b is removed and comb/c added, we
 * would not expect comb/c to be drawn since we never drew either that instance
 * or its parent comb.
 *
 * However, if comb/a and comb/b are drawn and then comb is drawn, the new comb
 * scene group will replace both the comb/a and comb/b groups since they are now
 * part of a higher level object being drawn.  If comb is drawn and comb/a is
 * subsequently drawn, it will be a no-op since "comb" is already covering that
 * case.
 *
 * The rule with bv_scene_group instances is their children must specify a
 * fully realized entity - if the s_name is "/comb/a" then everything below
 * /comb/a is drawn.  If /comb/a/obj1.s is erased, new bv_scene_group
 * entities will be needed to reflect the partial nature of /comb/a in the
 * visualization.  That requirement also propagates back up the tree. If a has
 * obj1.s and obj2.s below it, and /comb/a/obj1.s is erased, an original
 * "/comb" scene group will be replaced by new scene groups: /comb/a/obj2.s and
 * /comb/b.  Note that if /comb/a/obj1.s is subsequently drawn in isolation,
 * the scene groups will not collapse back to a single comb group - the user
 * will not at that point have explicitly issued instructions to draw comb as a
 * whole, even though all the individual elements have been drawn.  A "view
 * simplify" command should probably be added to support collapsing to the
 * simplest available option automatically in that situation.
 *
 * Note that the above rule is for explicit erasure from the drawn scene group
 * - if the structure of /comb/a is changed the drawn object is still "comb"
 * and the solid children of the existing group are updated to reflect the
 * current state of comb, rather than introducing new scene groups.
 *
 * Much like point_t and vect_t, the distinction between a group and an
 * individual object is largely semantic rather than a question of different
 * data storage.  A group just uses the bv_scene_obj container to store
 * group-wide default settings, and g.children holds the individual
 * bv_scene_obj entries corresponding to the solids.  A bv_scene_obj
 * should always map to a solid - a group may specify a solid but more
 * typically will reference the root of a CSG tree and have solids below it.
 * We define them to have different types only to help keep straight in the
 * code what is a conceptually a group and what is an individual scene object.
