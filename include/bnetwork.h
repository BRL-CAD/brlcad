/** @addtogroup bu_bnetwork
 *
 * @brief
 * BRL-CAD system compatibility wrapper header that provides declarations for
 * native and standard system NETWORKING routines.
 *
 * This header is commonly used in lieu of including the following: winsock2.h
 * (not select, fd_set), netinet/in.h, netinet/tcp.h, arpa/inet.h (htonl,
 * ntohl, etc)
 *
 * The logic in this header should not rely on common.h's HAVE_* defines and
 * should not be including the common.h header.  This is intended to be a
 * stand-alone portability header intended to be independent of build system,
 * reusable by external projects.
