// TODO - bview currently conflates scene and camera concepts - for example,
// data axes and polygons are properly scene objects being viewed by the
// camera, but at the moment they're directly part of the bview struct.
//
// The plan is to address this, so until this notice is removed the bview data
// structure and related data structures should be considered in flux.
