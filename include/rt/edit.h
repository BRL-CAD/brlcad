/** @file edit.h
 *
 * NOTE!!! This API is a work in progress as we migrate and consolidate
 * editing code from MGED, libged and other codes to a unified common
 * implementation in LIBRT.  Until this notice is removed, there are NO
 * guarantees of API stability with this code!
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 * Aside from the X/Y/Z-only scale operations, the "generic" operations for
 * both sed and oed seem to differ primarily in that the former update the
 * wireframe and primitive parameters immediately, and the latter manipulate
 * only the matrix until the final step.  In the oed case, the altered
 * primitive wireframes are handled by using the working matrix to distort the
 * existing draw solids.
 *
 * It feels like there should be some sort of consolidation possible here - in
 * the case where an operation (sed or oed) doesn't need a new wireframe,
 * reusing an existing one is a sensible approach.  For operations on large
 * combs, which may involve thousands of large wireframes, reuse is key.
 * Rather than have two "modes", what we should do instead is have the edit
 * operations themselves determine if a new wireframe is needed.  If not, then
 * no matter what the op is we should try to reuse an existing wireframe (if
 * one is available from the app) and only generate one if the app does not
 * have the one we need available.  That may allow us to completely eliminate
 * the distinction between sed and oed, and treat comb edits like any other
 * primitive edits by using functab methods (semi-related is the attempt to
 * make a comb tess method in d1dc6a4fae8).
 *
 * Such changes would involve a significant update to the MGED drawing logic,
 * which uses a very simple UP/DOWN flag trick to turn existing solid
 * wireframes into the edit wireframes (and comes with some significant
 * limitations as well).  What we really need is a way for a scene obj to
 * reference another scene obj and override specific values, so we can point to
 * an existing scene obj and use it for edit drawing without having to do
 * anything to the original obj except flagging it as involved (so the main
 * update pass knows to skip drawing it.) Commit de2c0da2d4a has a bit of what
 * would be needed for that to work, but there's a lot more to think about both
 * in the original and new draw cycles.  To properly have the edit drawing
 * independent of other uses of geometry in a scene while still enabling vlist
 * reuse (which the new drawing path isn't really doing properly) we may need
 * to have all comb instances define themselves in a scene as an object that
 * references another scene object which isn't drawn but holds the data
 * defining the vlist.  Then the instance obj would just hold the matrix and
 * any override info for color, etc.  Need to check how MGED is handling comb
 * instances now, the new drawing layer I think is just creating a new
 * bv_scene_obj for each instance with its own vlist...

//
// Eventually it might very well end up being used for an edit flag - it is
// quite reasonable to think that ft_edit_xy might take this flag and a mouse
// argument to select the geometrically closest editing feature from the solid
// and set the appropriate edit flag and/or per-prim data structure info - but
// right now we don't have anything like that.
#define RT_PARAMS_EDIT_PICK       5

// Matrix editing (done via oed in MGED) alters a matrix rather than solid

// at that time.)

//
// Not sure what the history is here - I suppose the thinking might be that
// the view can be set to axis align to get constrained movement in model
// coordinate space, and this allows for other constraints as well when the
// view is adjusted, but it has a definite drawback if the user wants to
// watch the movement of the solid along a model space X,Y or Z axis from
// another view while editing.  Also has the drawback that it is inconsistent

// those cases.  Just because a comb instance of a solid can be stretched, that
// does not mean the solid itself can support that shape.  Consequently, it is
// recommended that the _X, _Y and _Z versions of the scale operations be used
// sparingly if at all.  Even if a comb instance's tree is able to support
// rendering such an operation at the time the original edit is made, a

    /* Matrix-based editing visualizations are a different beast from edits

     * regenerate vlists based on new object parameters.  Applications
     * supporting solid editing need to be able to support visualizing an
     * entity whose source geometry visualization data is constantly changing.
     *
     * Combs, on the other hand, have a wireframe representation that consists
     * of one or more individual primitive wireframes from OTHER solids -
     * potentially *thousands* of them for large models.  Nor to matrix edits
     * typically call for a wireframe regeneration - tra and rot operations
     * definitely don't, and while scaled primitives might be more smoothly
     * represented by refreshed wireframes not all matrix edits can be
     * successfully translated to primitive param updates in all cases.  As
     * a result, for matrix-based editing wireframes are treated as static
     * data to be manipulated.
     *
     * Consequently, rather than generating copies of all those wireframes and
     * modifying them all every time an incremental edit is made, a more
     * efficient option is to re-use any existing wireframes the app already
     * has loaded for the comb tree in question and distort the *view space* to
     * reflect the editing operation while doing the draw.  Because the source
     * wireframe data isn't changing, view distortion drawing is feasible.
     *
     * Combs are *only* editable via matrix manipulations, so rather than
     * trying to manage the comb's editing visualization data in this struct
     * the problem is "punted" to the application, which can decide for itself
     * whether and how to reuse any existing wireframe information when drawing
     * editing objects.
     *
     * To use model_changes to generate appropriate matrices for this purpose,
     * the pattern looks like the following:
     *
     * mat_t model2objview;
     * struct bview *vp = <current view pointer>;
     * bn_mat_mul(model2objview, vp->gv_model2view, s->model_changes);
     * ## A second bn_mat_mul might be needed if a perspective matrix is in use
     * dm_loadmatrix(DMP, model2objview, which_eye);
     * ## Do the drawing
