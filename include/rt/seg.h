/** @addtogroup rt_seg
 * @brief Intersection segment.
 *
 * A "seg" or segment is a low level in/out ray/shape intersection solution,
 * derived by performing intersection calculations between a ray and a single
 * object.  Depending on the type of shape, a single ray may produce
 * multiple segments when intersected with that shape. Unless the object
 * happens to also be a top-level unioned object in the database, individual
 * segments must be "woven" together using boolean hierarchies to obtain the
 * final partitions which describe solid geometry along a ray.  An individual
 * segment may have either a positive or negative contribution to the "final"
 * partition, depending on whether parent combs designate their children
 * as unioned, intersected, or subtracted.
