/**
 * This structure is the only parameter to rt_shootray().  The entire
 * structure should be zeroed (e.g. by memset) before it is used the
 * first time.
 *
 * When calling rt_shootray(), these fields are mandatory:
 *
 * Field       | Description
 * ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------
 * a_ray.r_pt  | Starting point of ray to be fired
 * a_ray.r_dir | UNIT VECTOR with direction to fire in (dir cosines)
 * a_hit()     | Routine to call when something is hit
 * a_miss()    | Routine to call when ray misses everything
 * a_rt_i      | The current struct rt_i instance, which must be set to the value returned by rt_dirbuild().
 *
 * In addition, these fields are used by the library.  If they are set
 * to zero, default behavior will be used.
 *
 * Field            | Description
 * ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------
 * a_resource       | Pointer to CPU-specific resources.  Multi-CPU only.
 * a_overlap()      | DEPRECATED, set a_multioverlap() instead.
 *                    If non-null, this routine will be called to
 *                    handle overlap conditions.  See librt/bool.c
 *                    for calling sequence.
 *                    Return of 0 eliminates partition with overlap entirely
 *                    Return of !0 retains one partition in output
 * a_multioverlap() | Called when two or more regions overlap in a partition.
 *                    Default behavior used if pointer not set.
 *                    See librt/bool.c for calling sequence.
 * a_level          | Printed by librt on errors, but otherwise not used.
 * a_x              | Printed by librt on errors, but otherwise not used.
 * a_y              | Printed by librt on errors, but otherwise not used.
 * a_purpose        | Printed by librt on errors, but otherwise not used.
 * a_rbeam          | Used to compute beam coverage on geometry,
 * a_diverge        | for spline subdivision & many UV mappings.
 *
 *  Note that rt_shootray() returns the (int) return of the
 *  a_hit()/a_miss() function called, as well as placing it in
 *  a_return.  A future "multiple rays at a time" interface will only
 *  provide a_return.
 *
 *  Note that the organization of this structure, and the details of
 *  the non-mandatory elements are subject to change in every release.
 *  Therefore, rather than using compile-time structure
 *  initialization, you should create a zeroed-out structure, and then
 *  assign the intended values at runtime.  A zeroed structure can be
 *  obtained at compile time with "static struct application
 *  zero_ap;", or at run time by using memset(), bu_calloc(), or
 *  BU_ALLOC().
