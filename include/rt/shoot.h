/** @addtogroup rt_shoot
 *
 * @brief
 * Ray Tracing program shot coordinator. This is the heart of LIBRT's ray-tracing capability.
 *
 * Given a ray, shoot it at all the relevant parts of the model,
 * (building the finished_segs chain), and then call rt_boolregions()
 * to build and evaluate the partition chain.  If the ray actually hit
 * anything, call the application's a_hit() routine with a pointer to
 * the partition chain, otherwise, call the application's a_miss()
 * routine.
 *
 * It is important to note that rays extend infinitely only in the
 * positive direction.  The ray is composed of all points P, where
 *
 * P = r_pt + K * r_dir
 *
 * for K ranging from 0 to +infinity.  There is no looking backwards.

/**
 * @brief
 * Shoot a ray
 *
 * Note that the direction vector r_dir must have unit length; this is
 * mandatory, and is not ordinarily checked, in the name of
 * efficiency.
 *
 * Input:  Pointer to an application structure, with these mandatory fields:
 * a_ray.r_pt ==> Starting point of ray to be fired
 * a_ray.r_dir => UNIT VECTOR with direction to fire in (dir cosines)
 * a_hit =======> Routine to call when something is hit
 * a_miss ======> Routine to call when ray misses everything
 *
 * Calls user's a_miss() or a_hit() routine as appropriate passing
 * a_hit() a list of partitions intersected.  Note that only the
 * hit_dist elements of pt_inhit and pt_outhit are computed.  To
 * compute both hit_point and hit_normal, use:
 *
 * RT_HIT_NORMAL(NULL, hitp, stp, rayp, 0);
 *
 * To compute just the hit_point, use:
 *
 * VJOIN1(hitp->hit_point, rp->r_pt, hitp->hit_dist, rp->r_dir);
 *
 * These calculations are deferred to user code to avoid needless
 * computation in other ray situations.
 *
 * Formal Return: whatever the application function returns (an int).
 *
 * NOTE: The application functions may call rt_shootray() recursively.
 * Thus, none of the local variables may be static.
 *
 * To prevent having to lock the statistics variables in a PARALLEL
 * environment, all the statistics variables have been moved into the
 * 'resource' structure, which is allocated per-CPU.
