 * processed before and which haven't.  Elements in this table will
 * either be: (NULL) item not previously processed hitmiss ptr item
 * previously processed
 *
 * the 0th item in the array is a pointer to the head of the "hit"
 * list.  The 1th item in the array is a pointer to the head of the
 * "miss" list.
 *
 * B) If plane_pt is non-null then we are currently processing a face
 * intersection.  The plane_dist and ray_dist_to_plane are valid.  The
 * ray/edge intersector should check the distance from the plane
 * intercept to the edge and update "plane_closest" if the current
 * edge is closer to the intercept than the previous closest object.
