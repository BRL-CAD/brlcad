/**
 * Programmatic interface to the find-command style search functionality
 * available in librt for databases.  These functions search the
 * database using a supplied list of filter criteria and return either
 * db_full_path instances or directory pointers (depending on the function).
 * Both types of returns use a bu_ptbl container to hold the set of results.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 * * As long as struct db_i retains its pointer back to its parent rt_wdb
 *   structure, and dbip is a parameter in rt_wdb, only one of the two is
 *   needed as a parameter and either will work.  Probably go with rt_wdb,
 *   since it isn't tagged as private within the data structure definition,
 *   but on the other hand some ways db_i would be preferable since it
 *   would allow the search functions to break out cleanly into a
 *   hypothetical libgio/libdb that is separate from the raytracing.
 *   Unfortunately, the need to get to the internal form of some of the
 *   primitives means we do need rt_wdb available for now.  If the ways
 *   search currently is accessing rt_wdb could be avoided with a future
 *   improvement/redesign, then db_i and using the private link to rt_wdb
 *   is justified.  Need to discuss before this API is finalized.
 *
 * * Plan strings are the most intuitive way for humans to spell out a search
 *   pattern - db_search_formplan becomes a behind-the-scenes function that
 *   the user then doesn't have to worry about.  Only counterargument would
 *   be re-using plans already built from a string, and the slight overhead
 *   of rebuilding the plan from a string for repeated search calls isn't
 *   sufficient justification for the added API complexity without hard
 *   evidence that complexity is needed.
 *
 * * Offer simple function calls for the common cases of one path and an
 *   array of paths, and for both input cases support returning either
 *   a db_full_path set or a unique directory pointer set via table.  This
 *   should cover the most common programmatic situations, while still
 *   allowing commands enough flexibility to do what they need to (see,
 *   for example, combining results from search sets (multiple arrays
 *   of paths) in libged's search result consolidation.)
 *
 * * Need to add a plan option for dealing with hidden geometry during the search,
 *   maybe -nohide or something like that...  The traversal by default shouldn't
 *   traverse down anything hidden, but we should be able to override that at user request.
 *
 * WARNING:  THESE FUNCTIONS ARE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - IT IS NOT YET
 * ASSUMED THAT THE SEARCH API IS IN ITS FINAL FORM - DO NOT DEPEND ON IT
 * REMAINING THE SAME UNTIL THIS WARNING IS REMOVED
