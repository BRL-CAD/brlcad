/**
 * @brief Search for objects in a geometry database using filters
 *
 * The db_search function is a programmatic find-style interface that
 * lets you search for objects in a geometry database.  This function
 * searches the database using a supplied list of filter criteria.
 *
 * The function returns a count of objects matching the filter
 * criteria and can provide the resulting matches in binary format as
 * either db_full_path or directory objects depending on the flags
 * (i.e., depending on whether this is a flat or hierarchical search).
 *
 * There are a LOT of filter possibilities.  See the search(n) manual
 * page for details.
 *
 * @param[out] results is a bu_ptbl holding either db_full_path or
 * directory pointers.
 *
 * @param flags is a bit field for setting various search options.
 *
 * @param filter is a string defining search filters to be used.
 *
 * @param path_c is the count of directory paths to be searched.
 *
 * @param path_v is one or more directory paths to be searched.  If
 * path_v itself is NULL, all top-level objects are searched
 *
 * @param dbip The database instance pointer corresponding to the
 * current geometry database.
 *
 * @param ctx Context for -exec. Can be NULL if there are no -exec filters present.
 *
 *
 * @return Negative return values indicate a problem with the search,
 * and non-negative values indicate a successful search.  Non-negative
 * values correspond with the number of objects found.
 *
 * @retval -2 Return code when db_search is called with a NULL dbip.
 * @retval -1 Return code when the plan search string is invalid.
 * @retval 0  Return code when the search completed successfully but no matches were found.
 * @retval >0 Return code when the search completed successfully and matched one or more objects.
 *
 * The following example assumes a database instance pointer (dbip) is
 * available and ready to use.
 *
 * @code
 * size_t i = 0;
 * struct bu_ptbl results = BU_PTBL_INIT_ZERO;
 * const char *plan = "-name *.s -or -below -type region";
 * int matches = db_search(&results, DB_SEARCH_HIDDEN | DB_SEARCH_QUIET , plan, 0, NULL, dbip, ctx);
 * for (i = 0; matches > 0 && i < BU_PTBL_LEN(&results); i++) {
 *   char *path_str = db_path_to_string((struct db_full_path *)BU_PTBL_GET(&results, i));
 *   bu_log("%s\n", path_str);
 *   bu_free(path_str, "free db_fullpath_to_string allocation");
 * }
 * db_search_free(&results);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note:
 * Be aware that if you are using db_search to filter pre-built lists of paths,
 * you need to check that your generated path list is NOT empty before calling
 * db_search.  If you accidentally send an empty path list into db_search,
 * it will assume you wanted a tops list, which has a good chance of returning
 * unwanted results.
 *
