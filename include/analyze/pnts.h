/**
 * Using ray intersection, sample the database object obj and return a pnts
 * primitive.
 *
 * For the grid sampling method, the tolerance sets the number of rays fired.
 * max_time and max_pnts do *not* impact the GRID sampling logic.
 *
 * The max_pnts limit will cap the number of reported points for the
 * pseudorandom sampling methods, on a per method basis - i.e., the function
 * will return up to max_pnts for each non-grid sampling method that is
 * enabled.  If unset, the maximum pnt count return is 500,000 per method
 * (except for GRID).
 *
 * Likewise, max_time will limit the run time of each pseudorandom method, with
 * the total limit for all methods being method_cnt_enabled * max_time.
 *
 * Return codes:
 *
 * -1 - error
 *  0 - success
