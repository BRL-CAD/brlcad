// for the command tables in libtclcad and mged in favor of setting callback
// functions.  Another tell that we're getting it right will be the ability to
// eliminate most of the current callback hooks explicitly spelled out in the
// ged struct.
//
// ged_exec will always check for a specific command's callbacks, but commands
// can also internally check for things like the view refresh callback if the
// command implementation knows it will need to trigger it (draw, for example,
// should check for a view refresh callback once its work is done.)  Probably
// need to track to make sure we don't have infinite loops of callbacks calling
// callbacks assigned at run time - it'll be a situation similar to the Qt
// signal/slots mechanism where you can accidentally set such things up.
// Probably want to allow more than one callback function on the same command,
// maybe checking to prevent multiple calls to the same function getting
// assigned by mistake.
