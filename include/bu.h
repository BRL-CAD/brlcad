/** @addtogroup libbu
 *
 * @brief
 * The two letters "BU" stand for "BRL-CAD" and "Utility".  This
 * library provides several layers of low-level utility routines,
 * providing features that make cross-platform coding easier.
 *
 * Parallel processing support:  threads, semaphores, parallel-malloc.
 * Consolidated logging support:  bu_log(), bu_exit(), and bu_bomb().
 *
 * The intention is that these routines are general extensions to the
 * data types offered by the C language itself, and to the basic C
 * runtime support provided by the system LIBC.  All routines in LIBBU
 * are designed to be "parallel-safe" (sometimes called "mp-safe" or
 * "thread-safe" if parallelism is via threading) to greatly ease code
 * development for multiprocessor systems.
 *
 * All of the data types provided by this library are defined in bu.h
 * or appropriate included files from the ./bu subdirectory; none of
 * the routines in this library will depend on data types defined in
 * other BRL-CAD header files, such as vmath.h.  Look for those
 * routines in LIBBN.
 *
 * All truly fatal errors detected by the library use bu_bomb() to
 * exit with a status of 12.  The LIBBU variants of system calls
 * (e.g., bu_malloc()) do not return to the caller (unless there's a
 * bomb hook defined) unless they succeed, thus sparing the programmer
 * from constantly having to check for NULL return codes.
 *
