/** @file bu.h
 *
 * Main header file for the BRL-CAD Utility Library, LIBBU.
 *
 * The two letters "BU" stand for "BRL-CAD" and "Utility".  This
 * library provides several layers of low-level utility routines,
 * providing features that make cross-platform coding easier.
 *
 * Parallel processing support:  threads, semaphores, parallel-malloc.
 * Consolidated logging support:  bu_log(), bu_exit(), and bu_bomb().
 *
 * The intention is that these routines are general extensions to the
 * data types offered by the C language itself, and to the basic C
 * runtime support provided by the system LIBC.  All routines in LIBBU
 * are designed to be "parallel-safe" (sometimes called "mp-safe" or
 * "thread-safe" if parallelism is via threading) to greatly ease code
 * development for multiprocessor systems.
 *
 * All of the data types provided by this library are defined in bu.h
 * or appropriate included files from the ./bu subdirectory; none of
 * the routines in this library will depend on data types defined in
 * other BRL-CAD header files, such as vmath.h.  Look for those
 * routines in LIBBN.
 *
 * All truly fatal errors detected by the library use bu_bomb() to
 * exit with a status of 12.  The LIBBU variants of system calls
 * (e.g., bu_malloc()) do not return to the caller (unless there's a
 * bomb hook defined) unless they succeed, thus sparing the programmer
 * from constantly having to check for NULL return codes.

 * is available).  If 'output' is NULL, then dynamic memory will be
 * allocated and returned.
 *
 * The 'expression' parameter is a regular "bracket expression"
 * commonly used in globbing and POSIX regular expression character
 * matching.  An expression can be either a matching list (default) or
 * a non-matching list (starting with a circumflex '^' character).
 * For example, "abc" matches any of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
 * Specifying a non-matching list expression matches any character
 * except for the ones listed after the circumflex.  For example,
 * "^abc" matches any character except 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
 *
 * Backslash escape sequences are not allowed (e.g., \t or \x01) as
 * '\' will be matched literally.
 *
 * A range expression consists of two characters separated by a hyphen
 * and will match any single character between the two characters.
 * For example, "0-9a-c" is equivalent to "0123456789abc".  To match a
 * '-' dash literally, include it as the last or first (after any '^')
 * character within the expression.
 *
 * The expression may also contain named character classes but only
 * for ASCII input strings:
 *
 * [:alnum:] Alphanumeric characters: a-zA-Z0-9
 * [:alpha:] Alphabetic characters: a-zA-Z
 * [:blank:] Space and TAB characters
 * [:cntrl:] Control characters: ACSII 0x00-0X7F
 * [:digit:] Numeric characters: 0-9
 * [:graph:] Characters that are both printable and visible: ASCII 0x21-0X7E
 * [:lower:] Lowercase alphabetic characters: a-z
 * [:print:] Visible and space characters (not control characters): ASCII 0x20-0X7E
 * [:punct:] Punctuation characters (not letters, digits, control, or space): ][!"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@^_`{|}~-\
 * [:upper:] Uppercase alphabetic characters: A-Z
 * [:xdigit:] Hexadecimal digits: a-fA-F0-9
 * [:word:] (non-POSIX) Alphanumeric plus underscore: a-zA-Z0-9_
 *
 * A non-NULL output string is always returned.  This allows
 * expression chaining and embedding as function arguments but care
 * should be taken to free the dynamic memory being returned when
 * 'output' is NULL.
 *
 * If output 'size' is inadequate for holding the escaped input
 * string, bu_bomb() is called.
 *
 * Example:
 *   char *result;
 *   char buf[128];
 *   result = bu_str_escape("my fair lady", " ", buf, 128);
