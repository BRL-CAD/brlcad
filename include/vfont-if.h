/** @file vfont-if.h
 *
 *  This header file describes the in-memory format used by
 *  the BRL-CAD Package routines for manipulating fonts stored
 *  in the Berkeley VFONT format.
 *  Note that the VFONT files are in the format found on a VAX --
 *  no conversion has been applied.
 *  Merely TARing or RCPing the VAX /usr/lib/vfont directory onto
 *  any machine suffices to install the fonts.
 *  The VAX format of the fonts is invisible to software actually
 *  using the fonts, except to be aware that bit zero in a byte of
 *  font data is on the right hand side (lsb).
 *
 *  The VAX declaration of the file is:
 *
 *	struct header {
 *		short		magic;
 *		unsigned short	size;
 *		short		maxx;
 *		short		maxy;
 *		short		xtend;
 *	};
 *	struct dispatch {
 *		unsigned short	addr;
 *		short		nbytes;
 *		char		up, down, left, right;
 *		short		width;
 *	};
 *	char	bits[header.size];
 *
 *  The char fields up, down, left, and right in the VAX-version
 *  of struct dispatch are signed.  Use the SXT macro to extend the sign.
 *
 *  The actual bits array has the upper left corner of the bitmap in
 *  the first byte.  Bits are scanned out of the bytes in a
 *  left-to-right, top-to-bottom order (most decidedly non-VAX style).
 *  Never seems to be any consistency in data formats.
