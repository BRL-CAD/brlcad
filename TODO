BRL-CAD To Do List
==================

This document contains a collection of desirable BRL-CAD development
tasks.  Included is a list of the tasks expected for the current
monthly development release iteration, tasks that will hopefully be
completed within two iterations, and a remaining "backlog" of
unscheduled development tasks.

This is not an official list of tasks that will be completed.  Instead
it's more like a developer scratch pad for recording ideas and
coordinating release tasks.  At the beginning of each month,
developers add the tasks they expect to complete and then remove those
tasks as they are completed.


THESE TASKS SHOULD HAPPEN BEFORE THE NEXT RELEASE
-------------------------------------------------



THESE TASKS SHOULD HAPPEN WITHIN TWO RELEASE ITERATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------

* investigate thread affinity locking on Linux

* sync tgc/rec shot() behavior, sort results for proper normal.
  inspect t62 grazing with r653,r735 (tgc on an arb8) looking at ae0,0
  and z=1524 (was hit/overlap, now misses).

* libnmg: eliminate the nmgregion and model structures, rename shell
  to model (consider naming consistency of all public structs).

* implement a region anointment feature where the user can turn an
  assembly into a region and change all lower or higher regions into
  combinations.  basically consolidate or distribute region flags.
  this is partially covered by the 'comb' command but it tries hard to
  ensure geometry isn't left in a broken state.  needs to be a way to
  do the simple consolidate/distribute operation regardless of
  resulting state.

* address the ctest failure of bu_heap_test_1 (seen on ia32 fbsd)

* re-do the sh/enumerate.sh script for CMake

* heap unit test needs to actually compare performance against system
  allocation, not just do some work

* bundle primary rays in rt front end into postage stamps, shoot via
  rt_shootrays(), modify to pass all rays down through the spatial
  partitioning simultaneously

* fix the bu_semaphore unit test

* fix the bn_poly_sub unit test

* resolve bot bin sort optimization crash, disabled during release

* investigate INFINITY spatial partitioning issue.

* closing the graphics window brings down X11 on Mac due to a bad
  context.  fix or revert recent close window behavior.

* Rework p2t so it doesn't take down the application when a NURBS
  tessellation fails - should just abandon the problem input and
  continue.

* create a BRL-CAD .g with all possible object types embedded.  The
  csgbrep command is a good starting point, but only about half of
  them.

* make sure we can run db_dirbuild() multiple times without creating
  duplicate entries.

* rename all the g_* tools sans "_" [save until 7.??]

* havoc.g s.nos5g reliably exhibits the grazing edge bug where only
  one hit point is being returned.  to reproduce:
  e s.nos5g ; ae 35 25 ; units mm ; center 26912.4 7089.08 7168.96 ; nirt

* windows smp support


THESE ARE UNSCHEDULED BACKLOG TASKS
-----------------------------------

* Teach CMake to respect and use user-defined CMAKE_C_FLAGS and
  other options supplied at the command line and in environment
  variables.  See whether we can pass a variable into CMAKE_C_FLAGS
  that will allow specification of build flags at make time.

* investigate the possibility of allowing functions to define
  their own custom filters for some version of the db_search API.
  If we can figure out a programmatic approach of some kind, why
  not allow code to define their own "filters" that don't have
  a corresponding mapping to the MGED command string?  As long
  as the functions satisfy the API templates used by the db_plan
  structures, wouldn't custom functions work?

* merge get_eyemodel's functionality  as a "view eyemodel"
  sub-command in MGED/Archer.

* make gqa (and other apps that initialize similarly via libged or a
  wdbip) utilize TIE if LIBRT_BOT_MINTIE is set.  it's bypassing
  rt_dirbuild() so it never gets to where the environment variable is
  read.  another case for pushing the environment variable check a
  little lower (or somewhere in the path that gqa currently takes).

* document gqa centroid and moments of inertia options

* add support for custom and random views to gqa.  provide an option
  to evaluate every N degrees for all unique az/el pairings, e.g.,
  every 15 degrees.  should automatically discard duplicate views.

  command line usage:
  -a begin[:end[:count]][,...] -e begin[:end[:count]][,...]

  the begin, end, and count can be any real or integer number or can
  be a literal '#' to request a random integer number ranged [0,360]
  inclusive.  examples:

    Default 3 views (1 duplicate discarded): -a 0,90 -e 0,90
    One specific view: -a 35.12 -e 25.6
    360 orbital, every 30 degrees: -a 0,30,60,90,120,150
    360 orbital, every 30 degrees: -a 0:180:6
    10 random views: -a #:#:5 -e #:#:2
    Up to 129600 random views: -a #:#:# -e #:#:#
    Comprehensive "front" view, 1-degree increments: -a -90:90 -e -90:90
    Comprehensive orbital, 1/2-degree increments: -a 0:360:720

* have gqa calculate the volume of overlapping regions, not just
  shotline overlap distances.  that will allow output to be sorted by
  volumetrically significant regions and should eliminate a common
  source of user misunderstanding.  It should eliminate the perception
  that large overlaps are suddenly appearing when there are changes in
  grid alignment/density.

* fix gqa spewing of massive amounts of plot data with th -Av -v
  options:
  ../src/gtools/gqa -u m,m^3,kg -g 0.25m-0.5mm -p -Av -v gqa.g closed_box.r
  -rw-rw-r--  1 morrison users 41572569618 Apr 23 15:14 volume.pl

* make gqa overlap reporting suck less.  uselessly reports the same
  objects multiple times instead of keeping track of uniquely
  overlapping pairs of objects (rtcheck used to have this problem but
  not now).  also reports overlaps even when not requested (e.g. -Aa)

* gqa semaphore locking on results is very slow and gets worse as the
  number of cores and speed of cpu increases.  resource contention on
  semaphores slows everything down substantially.

* gqa needs to be more informative when it runs - needs a header
  letting you know what it's doing, and if possible a "progress
  report" for longer runs that provides some notion of how much of the
  total job is done.

* implement rt_volume() API for computing geometry volume (gqa style
  for complex, direct for primitives)

* modify gqa to search for >1 region flag in a tree path.

* rework fbcolor, fbzoom, and fbpoint to not use termlib, instead just
  using regular printing and input reading in a loop.

* write a manual page for the bot_fuse command

* Need to mark or otherwise disambiguate grazing hit segments so we
  can consistently retain or remove hits without introducing overlaps.
  Consider the case of a tgc stacked on top of an arb8, perfectly
  tangent, and shoot a ray at that point:

                                   -----   z=2.0
                                   |tgc|
  shoot a ray through here --->   -------- z=1.0   <--- or here
                                  | arb8 |
                                  -------- z=0.0

  Here are the primary concerns:

  A) solidity: a ray should never pass through the two without one or
  both evaluating to a hit,

  B) usability: a convention that precludes forcing the user to
  "nudge" them apart by some arbitrary epsilon is desired (it's
  intuitive and common for users to model two objects with "perfect
  tangency"),

  C) deterministic: firing a ray should give the same result every
  time that same ray is fired, and,

  D) bidirectional: a ray fired in one direction should evaluate to
  the same result if fired from the opposite direction along the same
  path (view independence).

  If we hit both, an overlap will ensue unless these objects are
  unioned.  This is undesirable.  If we miss both, slipping through
  the hairline "crack", it can be devastating for analysis and result
  in raytrace speckling.

  In order to only hit one, a consistent grazing policy must be
  applied such that grazing points on one "side" of an object are
  always kept and grazing hits on the other "side" are always thrown
  away.  The proposed method, similar to handling special case
  grazings with a Breseham line painter algorithm, is to consistently
  consider grazes with a procedure:

  1) Calculate the ray intersection, detect whether the hit is grazing
  (defined as a hit being barely in/on the surface either through a
  point, edge or even down a surface).

  2) Calculate a hit normal.  It may be desirable to average both the
  in/out hit points to get more of a "practical" surface normal.

  3) Calculate the ray of reflection.  Use the surface normal and ray
  of intersection to calculate our reflection direction.

  4) Determine which plane of a globally bounding rpp the reflected
  ray would intersect with.

  5) If the reflected ray hits the front, right, or bottom face, the
  grazing is kept, but if it reflects onto the back, left, or top
  face, the grazing is ignored.  In ray-view projected 2D, this
  corresponds with keeping the grazing if the reflection is pointing
  up or to the left and discarding if pointing down or to the right.

                                   discard top/left/rear
                rear              keep bottom/right/front
            .____________.
            |\           |\ t              discard
            | \          | \ o           ._________.
          l |  \         |  \ p          |/////////|
          e |   o____________o          d|//view// |
          f |   |        |   |          i|//of///  |
          t |   |        |   | r        s|//ray/   |k
        b   .___|________.   | i        c|////+    |e
         o  \   |         \  | g        a|////     |e
          t  \  |          \ | h        r|///      |p
           t  \ |           \| t        d|//       |
            o  \o____________o           ./________.
             m     front                     keep

  This should result in consistent grazing behavior that addresses the
  above case: we consistently hit the tgc but not the arb8 and there
  are no overlaps requiring modeler intervention.  The main problem
  with this approach, however, is calculating an appropriate surface
  normal for edge and face grazings can be difficult for some objects.

  In the case above, we do not get a hit on the tgc's bottom ellipse,
  for example, instead getting two hits near the edge of the side.
  Similarly, we hit the left and right arb8 faces, not the top face
  even though that is what we are conceptually grazing through.

  One possibility to address that difficulty is to simply report all
  grazing hits, but mark them as grazing, and let rt_shootray() sort
  it out by sampling a 3x3 pattern that determines if we're grazing
  the "top/left" or "bottom/right" side of a surface.

* fix the redblack tree callback function signatures.  they're
  declared and handled as taking (void) but they actually take a
  pointer and an int.  need to create a proper void* data parameter or
  change the interface to not require so much cast spagettery.

* decouple libwdb from librt, particularly the headers and relevant
  structures that cross over to both such as the rtgeom.h types.

* Translate the poly2tri routines into libbn C code

* Implement Shamos-Hoey test for checking whether a polygon is simple
  in libbn: http://geomalgorithms.com/a09-_intersect-3.html

* figure out what in f_matpick (or possibly some other related function)
  is causing ipathpos to get incremented to a number larger than the
  number of objects in the full path it's supposed to be referencing.

* Need to eliminate bu_argv0_full_path and rework the bu_brlcad_* functions
  that currently rely on it to take that path as a parameter from the
  calling application.  The library shouldn't be responsible for managing
  that path - there are too many issues with doing so.  The current approach
  fixes some concerns but breaks if an application changes its notion of
  the current working directory after initialization, for example.

* change _mged_ command prefix to a simple '.' prefix to hide/protect
  the built-in commands.

* the 'comb' command both updates and creates combinations.  this is a
  problem because it's not possible to infer an intended result from
  the command string alone.  it should either append to an existing
  combination and fail if it doesn't exist (with flag to create) OR it
  should create a combination and fail if there is an existing
  combination (with flag to append).

* Update the comb "region lift" capability to handle automatic duplication
  and substitution of the duplicate into the tree of combs who can't have
  their definitions changed without impacting other geometry in the .g file.

* change 'mirror' command offset to be prior to mirror instead of
  after, so that you can mirror intuitively over a specified point
  along a given axis.

* add option to 'mirror' command to delete the source object.  support
  specification of a plane as the view plane, 3 points, XY, YZ, XZ.

* refactor rt_mirror (src/librt/primitives/mirror.c) into the functab

* refactor rt_functab accessors to go through an api call or calls so
  that the array is not accessed directly.  either an rt_eval() style
  interface with data-driven keys to tell it with function(s) to call,
  or simply have an rt_*() for each function (e.g., rt_mirror(),
  rt_shot(), rt_describe(), etc.).

* review proc-db for promotion to src/shapes

* provide a viable FindBRLCAD.cmake

* replicate the GTK+ ISST interface in TCL

* Archer GUI needs to remember the last size of the command
  window when it is in detached (2 window) mode

* fix nurbs_ssi and nurbs_tester unit tests

* get rid of the -P#processors user option (except rt* tools) common
  on utilities.  call bu_avail_cpus() and provide an environment
  variable override used by the library.

* In tree.c line 531, the initialization of the local storage of the
  full path in stp->st_path is conditionalized on the specifics of
  the tree structure.  Why?  Could we get away with always initializing
  (or never initializing, if it is not used) the st_path?  Current
  behavior is odd - if a region has a solid unioned under it the st_path
  is not set, but if it has a comb unioned in the path is set - is this
  an optimization, and if so is it necessary?

* investigate integrating Blender's (OSL-based) Cycles engine:
  http://code.blender.org/index.php/2013/08/cycles-render-engine-released-with-permissive-license/

* investigate integrating Pixar's OpenSubdiv for subdivision surfaces:
  http://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv/

* the scale structure in bn_cmd_noise_slice (bn_tcl.c) was never
  initialized. it looks like somebody has planned to extend the
  function but never carried out

* implement a null spatial partitioning method so we can determine
  what other intersection hits are being masked (and what impact a
  given method has on performance)

* [hn]to[hn]* conversion functions were usurped by windows 8 so we
  need to either wrap them or undeprecate our xdr API or see if a
  simple config header fix might work (ideal)

* The sph wireframe drawing routine doesn't seem to like drawing very
  small spheres far from the origin:

  in test_2.s sph 1, 2, 1 0.0007  (draws a sphere wireframe correctly)
  in test_1.s sph 10000 -15000 3000 0.0007 (incorrect wireframe)

* use spatial partitioning during boolean processing of polygonal
  meshes.  good approach might be to generalize TIE's kd-tree to
  polygons or even create a new scheme (e.g., an integer-indexed grid
  layout).  data coherence would be nice (but not essential).  current
  approach is at least O(N^2) with large constant time.  New should be
  O(N*log(N)).

* rework the database object hash to push the iteration up into librt
  as API instead of expecting callers to use RT_DBNHASH and
  RT_DBHASH() manually.  consider using bu_hash or other container.

* rename chan_add, chan_mult, chan_permute and look into possibly
  merging them into one tool in the util directory.  similar to the
  'join' command, but arguably easier to use.

* temp colors and temp matrices during ray tracing, rt, rtwizard.
  need a command-line and mged method to override parameters.

* test new edit command

* fix 64b detection across platforms. Fix rhel 32/64 confusion

* test/fix patch-g on windows.  the input file read loops assume
  unix-style files resulting in parser errors.

* merge conv-vg2g into dbupgrade

* add option to rtedge to also show back-facing hidden edges

* add option to push/xpush to stop at the region level, to stop before
  primitives, to stop after N levels, to stop before N levels.

* make rt_dirbuild()+rt_dirbuild() work without vomiting error
  messages about duplicate geometry.  should be able to open the same
  database multiple times without running into rt_uniresource
  directory duplication

* convert teapot to use nurbs surfaces instead of bspline

* add an option to the bb command for calculating a bounding box that
  encompasses subtracted objects and trimmed surfaces and default to
  calculating a tight-fitting fbounding box once we have a robust path
  from geom->NURBS+CSG->NURBS.

* create a FASTGEN sample geometry with all entities defined and a
  corresponding regression test to make sure outputs don't change.

* investigate bu_vls_encode/decode failures on g-dot.c (see that
  file for FIXME note); add tests for both functions (note only
  g-dot.c wants to use the functions at the moment)

* verify/fix/improve rtarea.  There are reports that the rtarea
  command may have a bug in its calculations.  This needs to be
  investigated along with a review of the taxonomy used by rtarea for
  describing presented/projected areas.

* eliminate dbi_filepath (perhaps replace with dbi_filedir) as we
  shouldn't need to search.  we were told where the database was.

* check libbu implementation of red-black trees (see note in bu.h
  referencing an error in the Cormen book used as a basis)

* make libfb parallel-safe.  use bu memory management.  remove
  semaphore locks in src/rt/main.c and elsewhere.

* eliminate the need for bu_semaphore_init().  allocate up to the
  index requested on demand (so we can retain O(1) lookups) and
  reserve the first N semaphores for BRL-CAD library use.  change
  index to a uint8_t or uint16_t type.

* make libbn/plot3.c functions parallel-safe so callers do not have to
  manually wrap with bu_semaphore_acquire().

* implement a "bu_locate" function to consolidate bu_brlcad_root,
  bu_brlcad_data, and bu_brlcad_dir.  Pass in a bu_locate_t enum,
  the relative path, and the log/no-log flag.  Intent is to support
  flexibility implied by presence of BIN_DIR, LIB_DIR, etc. build
  settings.  Will need great care to ensure correct behavior is
  preserved - bu_brlcad_root and bu_brlcad_data will need verbose
  deprecation process, once bu_locate is implemented.  Also will
  need matching tcl function.

* rendering of the 'part' primitive is wrong for cases where H is less
  than r1 (i.e., smaller cap is partially or fully within the larger
  cap's radius).  It ends up rendering the larger sphere.

* update mged to not call wdb_init_obj and wdb_create_cmd, trace down
  other vestiges of wdb_obj for removal

* add support to rt tools and gtools for specifying az/el in radians
  or degrees, propagate throughout mged commands that take angles too.
  probably best implemented as a general libbn string to val function.
  perhaps an explicit 'rad' suffix and an implicit 'deg' suffix, e.g.
  rt -a 0.3rad -e 0.5rad and aet 0.3rad 45deg 0

* change fbserv usage to require a flag for its non-daemon mode, make
  the device type optional for both daemon and non-daemon mode

* work on vdeck/comgeom-g converters needed:
  - primitives recognized by comgeom-g but not vdeck:
      ehy, epa, eto, rhc, rpc
  - primitives recognized by comgeom-g (but not vdeck) but
    with possible equivalent versions in BRL-CAD:
      haf (half), rvw (right vertical wedge), raw (arb8), wed (DoE name
      for 'raw'), wir (pipe), arw (arbitrary wedge [ERIM?])
  - generate new comgeom-g tests with tgms from old GIFT docs

* test tgf-g conversion with "ring-mode" geometry

* investigate why the new bbox() routines for ARS and BoT result in
  bounding boxes that are way too big.

* fix metaball/adjust.. wipes out all metaball values with:
  adjust metaball 1 1 1
  just gives usage with:
  adjust metaball 1 1

* test for -msse3 requirement for __SSE.*__ definition

* improve sse run-time detection so illegal instruction crashes are
  avoided.  presently, adding -msse* to compilation will result in a
  crash if that binary is run on non-sse hardware (e.g., Pentium M)

* implement uv-mapping callback so we can texture-map BoT, NMG, and
  NURBS geometry

* add support for a zoom/viewsize and twist options to rt so you can
  adjust the image without having to feed a view script.

* provide pkgIndex.tcl files for bu, bn, rt, fb, dm so we can properly
  package require the libs without an explicit 'load'

* struct rt_bot_internal should be using "size_t *" instead of "int *"
  for the faces and face_normals members

* fix the "(type)(size_t)val" hacks (using ints like ptrs, etc.)

* Mac OS X mouse input binding problem seems to be back with rotations
  stalling during interactive use.

* killall command reports db_lookup failures if the target object
  doesn't exist (maybe we only care about refs).  should keep quiet.

* pixdiff reports bytes, but reports incorrect (off-by-one) bytes for
  .bw input files.  cause is due to tool assuming input is rgb triplets
  (even though output is bytes, wtf?).  should probably report pixels
  and/or have a -b option for handling byte/bw input.

* the new "exists" command is a beautiful corollary to the unix 'test'
  command.  make the usage match, remove options that make no sense
  after you've replaced instances of 'file' with 'object', and add
  options specific to testing geometry (like whether two objects
  overlap, whether an object's volume is greater than some value or
  equal to zero, whether two objects are actually the same object
  (geometrically), etc.).

* investigate why epa primitive is so sensitive to coarse absolute
  value changes (run csgbrep, tol abs=1, facetize and get 321k poly)

* implement a new "simulate" command for applying physics deformations
  to geometry.  Each timestep (default steps==1) would get recorded as
  new geometry unless updating the existing is requested.  Usage might
  be something like this:

     simulate [-k] [-g|-G] [-f x y z N] <time> [steps]

  Examples:
     simulate 10.5  # simulate 10.5s of time (default gravity)
     simulate 3 10  # simulate 30s of time, 10s per timestep
     simulate -f 0 0 -1.0 9.807 3.0  # earth's gravity for 3s
     simulate -k 1.0  # simulate 1s of gravity, overwriting original
     simulate -G -f 1 2 3 .4 5  # no gravity, custom force, 5s

* implement http network transfer tool for crash reports and benchmark
  analyses (via libfetch)

* reimplement benchmark suite in C/C++

* include defaults about the compiler in the benchmark suite output
  including the compiler name and version at a minimum, plus hopefully
  describing the CFLAGS that were used too.  ideally would include all
  of the versioning details (such as described from "gcc -v" if we
  compiled with gcc) too.

* make bu_dirname not allocation memory.  have caller pass
  buffer in as a parameter with size ala snprintf/memcpy.

* provide libdm mechanism for drawing spline curves (to help visualize
  flight paths, show object trajectories, etc.).

* provide option for displaying object bounding boxes while rotating.
  visualization feature to help with rotation operations, showing
  global object alignment with respect to its own coordinate space.

* make mged not have a garbled display manager window if the
  framebuffer is enabled and the window is resized.  initialize and
  refresh the new memory and zap the framebuffer.

* merge sed and oed commands

* make the right-hand path to oed optional

* deprecate dbcp and merge functionality (and improved
  double-buffering) with the buffer tool.

* vls name wrapping (reversible argv-to-vls, vls-to-argv).  look at
  src/libged/glob.c code, very similar.

* release dm X get_color() memory

* update g-xxx_facets to use libgcv

* add distribution test for making sure the source code conventions
  for function replacements are being respected (e.g., bu_strcmp()
  instead of strcmp()).

* make sure 'preview' works, particularly the 'tree' subcommand.

* make nreed's new bot cleanup interface update interactively without
  resorting to calls to Tcl_DoOneEvent() down in librt.

* convert all calls to BU_SETJUMP/BU_UNSETJUMP into familiar try/catch
  logic layout using if/else.

* bu_cv_optimize() should be using bu_byteorder().

* render annotated images to the OpenDocument format.  this is
  particularly useful for rtedge-style renderings with object
  annotations where we can leverage layout components and scalable
  vector graphics.

* investigate OpenEXR (BSD licensed HDE image format)

* add support for a custom unit conversion factor to the units command
  (e.g. 'units 9.3120223' or 'units metertons 9.3120223')

* usage statistics.  similar to the eclipse Usage Data Collector, keep
  track of which BRL-CAD command-line commands and MGED/libged
  commands are run.  Give the user the option of uploading those
  statistics (now, always, later, off).  Provide terms of use
  explaining the ways that their data will be used and shared.
  aggregate, this can help us focus development resources towards
  improving workflows, documentation, robustness, and new development
  areas.

* automatic anti-aliasing as a second render pass on the edges
  encountered (possibly using bilinear filtering scheme, improve upon
  rtedge's current simple filter)

* make loadview still load the view if the database doesn't match the
  currently open database, only load geometry as an option (and then
  just ignore the db).

* add a force option to the tracers to support overwriting the current
  output file (so long as we're going to make it read-only by default).

* convert non-planar arb's to brep objects for ray-tracing.  see how
  well it works to see if we can remove an arb limitation.

* clean up new rt -l8 heat graph lighting model so that it works in
  parallel and with no "splotches"

* make rt_prep_timer() take or return a context that gets subsequently
  passed to rt_get_timer() calls for returning the elapsed time.  this
  will allow multiple overlapping timers instead of just one global
  timers.  move the timing facilities to libbu as part of the process
  so API can be obsoleted cleanly.

* separation of stderr from stdout within libbu, particularly for
  MGED, so that there is a clean separation of result output from
  diagnostic output.  this is a fairly separate idea from having log
  levels (ala syslog) but is somewhat related to the concept of having
  definable output streams.  idea in mind is to have a bu facility to
  obtain a bu_log()-style callback function returned from a
  logger registration function.

* deprecate dbfind - ensure functionality is fully captured by the
  search command, make it report a deprecation statement on use and
  utilize search under the hood.

* investigate impact of using lookup tables for root solving.
  implement lookup tables for a range of linear, quadratic, cubic, and
  quartic polynomial coefficients.  compare performance to root
  solving without lookups.  evaluate memory use.  non-imaginary roots
  are relatively sparse, may need to consider linked lists, hash
  tables, or some hybrid storage arrangement.  Idea inspired by:
  http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/

* libbn's tri_specific structure requires user-provided memory for
  normals.. this certainly saves memory if the triangles don't have
  normals but at a rather expensive malloc cost (which is being seen
  on large BoT models) during prep.

* make fbclear and raytrace control panel obey a -F advanced option,
  i.e., better remote framebuffer support.

* MINOR: add tolerance parameters to the bn_*() functions that have
  near-zero tests.

* add an option to bot_dump for outputting surface normals.  Make sure
  all supported dump formats (obj, dxf, etc.) optionally write out
  normals.  Consider adding an option to smoothly interpolate normals
  (per face or vertex).

* make rtarea display a cross-hair and perhaps coordinates for the
  center of area if run from within mged.

* refactor and manage libbn tolerance uses by providing an interface
  default (e.g., an init macro) and making everyone use that where it
  is hardcoded to 0.0005 presently (and a few places where it's
  inconsistently/incorrectly 0.005).

* add a default phong 'metal' shader.  annoying to keep making plastic
  more reflective or mirror less reflective when it's such a common
  material appearance to want.

* consider adding an option to reid/remat and edcodes (and others?) to
  ignore negative regions (regions subtracted from regions or
  intersected with them) since, while bad practice, are valid
  geometrically.

* implement some sort of archive/backup command in mged in order to
  save the currently open database out to a file.

* make sure there are no getenv() non-NULL assumptions within the
  code.  might want to see if there's a pattern of variables being
  checked such that a libbu interface would be warranted (e.g.,
  instead of checking HOME, having a bu_find_directory(BU_USER_HOME)
  routine or similar facility) for finding common resource locations.

* make db_open modes behave the same as the fopen() modes (i.e.,
  create the .g if one doesn't exist when write mode)

* fix the shaders.sh regression test case, failing due to changes
  with mged's view initialization.

* inside support for ARS

* add support to 'rtxray' for outputting inverted pixel values so that
  we have pixel values that are directly related to material thickness

* make color and vectors on pnts work

* mged inconsistently ignores signals.  initially allowing mged to be
  backgrounded, but then later ignores them.  needs to consistently
  ignore or not ignore them, ideally the latter.

* libfb needs to have the fb_open/close_existing functions refactored
  into the function table and have the #ifdef sections removed.

* integrate library tester into regression suite that validates
  exported library symbols published in headers.  make sure they at
  least exist and maybe even try to ensure they will run with null
  arguments without crashing.

* make _plot() callbacks fill in plot objects instead of returning
  line segments.

* implement a jitter-style option to rt that makes it average the ray
  results to take a weighted light contribution for a given
  resolution.  saves more memory over rendering at 2x/4x/8x/whatever
  with or without jitter and then scaling down.  present jitter option
  doesn't average.

* refactor mged/bwish/g_diff initialization to all use the same routine

* deprecate either orot or rotobj

* refactor mged's signal handling to make it possible to safely
  interrupt long-running commands

* add a -color option to all mged commands that draw geometry (B, eid,
  and E come to mind)

* have mged record a timestamped command history by default

* implement -exec support for 'search' command

* implement -param support for 'search' command

* mged crashes on Mac if using system Tcl/Tk with our incrTcl.
  crashes with the following stack (same whether dm-X or dm-ogl):
	XQueryExtension
	...
	glxGetConfig
	ogl_choose_visual (dm-ogl.c:1359)
	ogl_open (dm-ogl.c:401)
	dm_open (dm-generic:82)

* readd support for vrml v1 to g-vrml so that users can select whether
  they want v2 (default) or previous v1 output format via a
  command-line switch.  see http://brlcad.svn.sf.net/viewvc/brlcad/brlcad/trunk/conv/g-vrml.c?view=diff&pathrev=22798&r1=16900&r2=16901

* make Mac OS X universal binaries actually work.

* fully implement analyze for all primitives

* implement general analyze estimate (perhaps just raytrace it) for
  primitives where values like surface area or volume are very
  difficult to calculate.

* move analyze logic into librt (with their respective primitives).

* fix analyze output formatting, columns are pooched.
    (for arbs, it should be fixed as of revision 48900)

* extend analyze output formatting to user-specified formats ala nirt

* calculate products of inertia in 'analyze' and/or gqa output

* calculate radii of gyration in 'analyze' and/or gqa output

* implement 'analyze' command option to write output to a file

* implement make, ted, edsol, mirror, and analyze for revolve
  primitive.  implement tess() too.

* fix/change naming convention for presented/exposed area

* re-enable RISE client in ADRT

* test homovulgaris' root solver patch that puts coefficients in the
  right order

* review librt polynomial root solver (cubic and quadratic case)

* give bot-bldxf the axe (reconcile and merge with bot_dump)

* implement mged object name globbing similar to tclsh's globbing
  (i.e. via a globbing command and quoting globs that use []).  testing
  shows db_glob doesn't seem to behave correctly, at least not like
  glob.  hook globbing into all commands so glob_compat_mode
  statefulness can go away.  a db_glob expression that doesn't match
  anything should not return the expression.

* come up with a new tool that automatically generates "inside"
  regions for a given model as a way to automatically model air.
  particularly useful for bot models where the inside air compartment
  is predominantly (but not entirely) a complex bot structure in
  itself.  idea is to use some sort of marching cubes/tets to find
  those volumes, perhaps use a libified gqa.

* extend metaball control info beyond simple points (e.g., line
  segments)

* address the TODO items in src/mged/clone.c

* fix rt parallel crash
  (true ; while [ $? -eq 0 ] ; do rt -o /dev/null moss.g all.g ; done)

* fix parallel crash report generation (multiple BU_MAPPED_FILE's
  getting acquired)

* make only closing BOTH the command window and graphics window shut
  down mged (i.e., fix unintentional behavior), not either alone.

* add keybinding to restore a command window if only the graphics
  window remains.

* remove hit_normal and hit_point from struct hit.  add RT_HIT_POINT
  macro.  refactor all callers as needed.

* make bombardier actually send the report somewhere

* hook bombardier in for crash reporting

* modify the new tree traversal code to be generic

* add high dynamic range image support to the framebuffers

* add alpha channel support to the framebuffers

* remote framebuffer timeout support (perhaps as ::key=val;key=val)

* develop a tool that applies a text overlay to a given rendered image
  (e.g., as an rt option) for things like adding an image title, the
  az/el, and objects displayed.

* bezier extrusions need to be optimized, really should not be
  performing dynamic memory allocation in the root solver

* better/consistent argument processing supporting both long and short
  option names, perhaps using argtable

* decouple libdm from librt -- just one file in libdm uses librt,
  including a whole nasty primitive switch statement.  need to push
  that back over into librt.

* Implement an optical shader for the new "pixelated" military
  camouflage style

* preserve an arb8 as an arb8 (instead of writing as arb6 or arb5) and
  similarly for the other arb# sizes

* enhance dxf-g to create more than just one combination per layer,
  creating multiple objects for the individual objects in the dxf file
  (instead of one conglomerate BoT)

* add an overlap depth reporting tolerance parameter to the
  ray-tracers (similar to -R).

* Generate plain .zip files for Windows binary releases

* fix the variety of ami.tcl and ampi.tcl tclscript warnings/errors

* run indent.sh on directories (one at a time, validating results)

* configure support to enable/disable framebuffers, display
  managers, geometry converters, and image converters.  consider
  apache's module management as an example.

* review and merge in the rest of the GSI modifications

* display the current mode in mged graphics window

* Optional compile-time support for using GMP or CLN for arbitrary
  exact precision arithmetic computation support

* inside/outside point and voxel testing capability in librt

* automatic geometry voxelizer (perhaps using arbs or vol primitive)

* implement support for raw voxel data (g-voxel) where each position
  in the binary array (unsigned 8-bit integer) corresponds to a voxel
  coordinate given by X + Y x Nx + Z x Nx * Ny where Nx = grid width
  and Ny = grid height.  this consequently happens to match our bw
  format if you concatenated N bw image slices into one file.  for a
  2x2 example, position=>coordinate: 0=>0,0,0; 1=>1,0,0; 2=>0,1,0;
  3=>1,1,0; 4=>0,0,1; 5=>1,0,1; 6=>0,1,1; 7=>1,1,1. See
  http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Reference/File_formats/Export_file_formats/Volume_data_set_file_formats.htm

* turn geometry converters and image converters into libraries
  (started as libraries libgcv and libicv)

* add support for querying geometry properties to library including
  computing surface area and weight/mass.

* add verification and validation tests confirming behavior of the
  ray-tracer and computations of area, mass, volume, etc.

* testing suite for all binaries:

     for cmd2 in $(for cmd in `find . -name Makefile.am | xargs cat | perl -pi -e 's/\\\\\n//g'| grep -E "PROGRAMS ?=" | sed 's/.*=//g'` ; do echo $cmd ; done | sort | uniq ) ; do echo command: $cmd2 ; done

* add geometry example of building 238

* Mac OS X SGI dial knobs support

* ability to "unpush" objects, translating them to a new position and
  applying the correct matrix (using either bounding box or center of
  mass, for example).  would be useful to optionally allow the
  creation of a parent combination that contains the unpushed matrix
  so you could return primitives to local coordinates.  See sf feature
  request 2826720 from cericole.

* optimize CSG structures automatically: automatic simplification,
  tree contraction, null object detection.

* have libbu report memory allocation statistics so the exact amount
  of memory requirements for a geometry database can be computed on
  the fly via a pre-prep phase.

* libfb + font rendering (perhaps through libbn's plot interface) for
  a posix terminal.

* OpenCL for enhanced performance boolweave sorting

* getexecname, "/proc/self/cmdline", program_invocation_short_name.
  separate out into new file.

* geometry viewing commands/visualizations of exploded levels

* librt-based path tracer

* system identifier application with sysctl-style information
  database, with some back-end functionality placed into libbu.

* add callback data parameters to libpkg hook functions

* rtedge-style tracer that outputs tool paths (splines/segments, etc.)
  for CNC/CAM style toolpath cutting descriptions (g-code files).

* rtedge shoots twice as many rays as it needs to (shoots the 'below'
  ray for each primary, only reusing current scanline cells).

* make the DSP primitive use less memory when data is coming from
  a binunif. allocating 160 times binunif size is a bit extravagant
  (which comes from sizeof(struct dsp_bb)).

* add dynamic geometry support. i.e. the ability to modify the parsed
  in-memory geometry tree on the fly via api calls (e.g. to add holes)

* investigate why g-iges followed by iges-g on a single box results in
  permuted vertex lists

* add support for filesystem-based geometry collections

* design plugin system to allow domain specific tools (say, for example,
  a tool to create propeller parts) to identify themselves and their
  features to BRL-CAD, and to allow BRL-CAD to incorporate those features
  as an integrated part of interaction environments.

* see if it is possible to use tec/ehy primitives to create a proc-db
  for airfoil/wing shapes.  Interesting possibilities with boolean combinations
  of these primitives, provided their continuity at the ends ensures
  continuity all along "seams" - something to consider.

* incorporate some variety of spatial partitioning into the facetize command
  (may involve just rewriting it) to try and realize MUCH faster tessellation
  of CSG geometry.  Current routines are doing a lot of unnecessary work that
  tends to result in explosive completion times for worst-case scenarios -
  try to get closer to the "only do the work we need to" ideal.  Once a new
  idea is proven in that command, it should be made into a libgcv routine
  and converters/other commands retargeted to use it.

* look into embedding both rgb[3] and complex[n] data types in a union to
  allow unification of libmultispectral and liboptical APIs to a single
  more general liboptical.  Need to be careful about performance and
  maintainability concerns.

* we need to define a libbu api for option handling that supports more
  features than getopt:

  - need support for long options (e.g. --help and --color, not just -h
    and -C)

  - need a way to consolidate documentation for options into one place
    (DRY) that supports all of our various documentation styles.  Discussed
    with Sean in the past - initial thoughts:

    + should be in C code - will be needed there, and easier to get it from
      there to other formats than vice versa.

    + should support printing out the options and documentation in formatted
      structures that allow our build system to build the command and have
      the command itself supply a generated snippit of text or markup that
      could be incorporated into the final document - e.g. the DocBook
      man page for a command would be set up to expect the <command>_options.xml
      file generated by <command> --print-options DocBook (or some other
      mechanism, that's just an idea) and the CMake build could first build and
      then run the command at compilation time to provide the absolute most
      current option listing and short descriptions for the other docs.

  - need to allow order dependent options (e.g. <command> inputfile outputfile)
    that become order independent if enough information is available, e.g. the
    above would work and <command> <opt1> -i inputfile <opt2> -o outputfile <opt3>
    would also work.

  - (maybe) incorporate some sort of sanity/bounds checking into the option
    definitions API - i.e. in the C definition of an option, there could
    be optional parameters to indicate the type and bounds of valid input
    to that option.  Won't always be possible, but may be a good feature
    to have if it can save lots of repetitive coding of bounds checking in
    programs.

  *might* be worth taking a look at http://rpm5.org/files/popt/ to see if
  they have any code we could snarf to make life easier, but regardless
  we need a libbu API on top of any other code - at such a core level,
  we can't introduce an external API.

* investigate the libngpcore and libngput libraries from the ngPlant
  project as a possible means of procedurally generating plant models
  in BRL-CAD (libraries are BSD licensed: http://ngplant.sourceforge.net)

DATABASE MAINTENANCE/ADMINISTRATION
-----------------------------------

(Note: See src/util/admin-db.cpp for a starting admin tool which could
be expanded to do the following tasks.)

* implement some means (perhaps glint) to check a .g file for
  duplicate region IDs and material inconsistencies.  perhaps exposed
  as a new command, it should take an assembly/comb name as input,
  walk the tree, and report duplicates.  if no arg, it walks all
  top-level objects but processes them independently and only reports
  sub-paths once (so you don't get the same object repeatedly reported
  for all N top-level copies).  in the output, group together regions
  with same and different material properties together:

DUPLICATE ID NUMBERS
comp.r1 ID 1234
comp.r2 ID 1234

DUPLICATE ID NUMBERS WITH DIFFERENT MATERIAL PROPERTIES
comp.r3 ID 5678 material code 1 LOS 50
comp.r4 ID 5678 material code 5 LOS 75

* develop a low-level tool for investigating, reporting statistics on,
  and repairing geometry database files.  the tool should nominally
  perform big/little endian conversions, report number and types of
  objects, allow deletion/undeletion/hiding/unhiding, provide some
  general means to manipulate the packed and unpacked .g file data for
  performing low-level modifications


LIBGED
------

* See src/libged/TODO for new command ideas.

* Extract bounding box code from both autoview.c and get_autoview.c
  into a general bounding rpp function in libged (or perhaps librt if
  it generalizes sufficiently), and use accordingly.  Should combin
  autoview.c with get_autoview.c (perhaps as a flag) and utilize the
  general function in lots of libged places (e.g., the ged_arb()
  function).

* hook marching cubes into libged facetize

* fix ged 'joint' command, need to figure out how libged should handle
  non-object additions to the wireframe (or maybe they should be
  objects, but not mged's faked solids ala cvt_vlblock_to_solids()).

* break cyclic dependency between libdm and libged.  libged should not
  be aware of libdm (screengrab command).  to implement a ged command
  that updates the display, the gedp could provide a means to
  register a callback so (for example) mged could register a function
  that gets passed a dmp, and libged would call back into that
  front-end client function instead of a direct call so library
  encapsulation is maintained.

* implement oed+tra/sca/rot functionality consistently in libged as
  translate/scale/rotate with a signature similar to:

  {translate|rotate|scale} [--keypoint {bb_corner|bb_center}:{object_name} | {3d position}] [--relative xdist [ydist [zdist]] | --absolute xpos [ypos [zpos]]] object_name(s)

  where 'oed' is basically converted into the --keypoint option and
  object(s) to work on.

* restore libged axis/grid commands code made in r44153 but with
  libged decoupled from libdm/libfb.

* migrate / update screengrab command in libged (libfb/libdm dep)

* the 'l' and 'analyze' commands now require an object be specified
  and won't use the currently highlighted solid.  undoubtedly related
  to libged refactoring.  this is related to sf request 2954409.

* fix !!! in src/libged/tables.c where a temporary file is getting
  used.  needs to call bu_temp_file().

* make the 'tree' command accept a full path, not just a combination

* make the 'tables' ged command not call system() on the "sort" unix
  command.  It should perform all sorting on the data directly in
  memory, at least without creating another process.

* refactor the libtclcad go_*() functions and invocation wrappers
  (also in mged) into libged where appropriate. the 'png' command
  comes to mind.

* refactor wdb_obj and view_obj in libged.  with the de-tcl'ing of the
  base libs, it should disappear but shouldn't have wdb_*() funcs in
  libged regardless.  work in progress.

* make ged command names aware of object arguments for automatic
  globbing and regular expression expansion:
	attr set [regex .*\.r] t 1
	attr set [glob *.r] t 1
	attr set *.r t 1

* review adding support for infix and postfix CSG operators for
  libged/mged.  be sure to revive or at least check out the previous
  effort in src/mged/comb_bool_parse.y that already has support that
  recognizes the classical infix notation.

* option to mged make command or new command that enters solid edit
  mode, "med", "smake", "makes", "msed", etc.  same for cp command.

* add per-face analysis of primitives like tgc, arb to their respective
  analyze commands in libged

* refactor .density file and density database reading code in files
  src/rt/viewweight.c, src/libged/analyze.c and src/libged/gqa.c into
  common code in src/libanalyze (there may be more candidates around
  the tree)


SHADED DISPLAYS
---------------

* See doc/TODO.shaded_displays


ARCHER
------

* See src/archer/TODO


ATTRIBUTES
----------

* implement an attribute versioning system.  can hang attribute
  version off of _GLOBAL (ideally) or per-object so application codes
  (including our own tools) know whether they're compatible or whether
  the attributes must be upgraded.

* implement an "attr upgrade" subcommand that allows for forwards AND
  backwards conversion of attributes.  the command will need two
  function pointers per version that describes how to upgrade and
  downgrade for that version transition.  this will allow new files to
  be downgraded for use on older versions and obviously lets new files
  be upgraded to the latest conventions.

* implement namespacing for attributes as a means to group attributes
  together.  examples: cad:color, cad:region_id, muves:component.
  similar to svn properties, the namespace is predominantly (perhaps
  entirely) a naming convention, but allows us to document and assert
  requirements/conventions over a given prefix (e.g., 'cad:'), and
  provides 3rd party applications with a sandbox to work with.

* expose the list of internally recognized attributes via the man page
  documentation and some internal method (e.g., an 'attr standards'
  subcommand).

* clean up default attributes to be consistent and upgrade old
  attributes to their new names.  includes likes of region, region_id,
  material_id, air, los, rgb, oshader, and inherit.  see
  doc/docbook/system/man5/en/attributes.xml for more detailed listing.

* implement an option to "attr upgrade" for reading upgrade/downgrade
  plugins/instructions from an external file for 3rd party use.

* prevent nirt from outputting a trailing space after values when
  there are no attributes to be displayed.  the problem is in the nirt
  format strings where they use " %s" for displaying any attributes.
  need to left-pad a space conditionally, perhaps by supporting %*s
  and sizeof(var).

* add additional support for user-specified sorting for the attr
  command when new attribute attributes are added (e.g., creation
  date)

* binary attributes, see binary-incompatible section for details.


NEW OBJECTS
-----------

* annotation primitive.  specifically a means to create an object in
  the database that can optionally be associated with another object
  and/or position(s) that a label refers to.  there are various styles
  such as a single line from a point to text and two lines (e.g.,
  indicating measurement) to text.

  the object should allow for different line styles including having
  no lines.  there should also be support for view-fixed or
  view-independent annotation placement (which requires a change to
  plot()'s and possibly prep()'s signature).  it would also be useful
  to allow an optional _annotation_ "thickness" so that the
  annotations can represent physical geometry (so they raytrace).

  the concept is nearly equivalent to a combined sketch+extrude object
  but with options specific to annotations.  the underlying export
  form should be fully generalized as much as possible with a
  higher-level "in" command constraining available options into a
  user-friendly form.  a new "annotate" command will similarly be
  needed to support modification of existing annotations (as well as
  creation ala the 'in' command).  see the web for tons of examples.

       draw feature control frame  (characteristic tolerances in symbolic form: www.draftingzone.com/shoppingzone/6-1.pdf)
       3d thickness

* offset surfaces.  provide feature edit operation to create a solid
  "level set" style object so you can represent degraded geometry
  states (e.g., damage around a hole in a plate of metal might be
  represented by the toroidal intersection with a cylinder some radius
  larger than the hole, providing a separate region that can have
  different material properties).

  geometrically, this is simply a means to separate a given object
  into multiple objects without changing the cumulative volume.  a
  linear offset from a given surface or set of surfaces is usually
  desired.

* Cache objects.  These are proper non-geometric geometry database
  objects intended to store binary results that have a dependency on
  other object(s).  A named hash (e.g. md5) is recorded for each
  dependent object along with the computed results.

  Three potential candidates for leveraging cache objects are 1) prep
  objects containing the final prepped state of a given object
  hierarchy (particularly useful for BoT and BREP geometry), 2)
  raytrace objects containing the intersection results for a given
  view (i.e., a grid of primary rays), and 3) rtgl point samples
  (which is a variant of 2 but potentially view independent).

* alias objects.  this is an object handle in a geometry database that
  refers to another geometry database object.  in effect, it
  encapsulates the idea of a symbolic reference for database objects.

  alias objects should be very lightweight, corresponding to basically
  a simple named reference to another object.  this allows for
  geometry objects to have multiple names, all referencing a given
  primary name.  whenever an alias is referenced, it returns the
  object pointed to instead of the alias object itself (this includes
  the rt_db_internal()).  this prevents the creation of cyclic
  references.

  this directly supports geometry importers that contain object name
  mappings (e.g., part numbers to engineering names) as well as
  simply supporting multiple names per object that one might want to
  persist.  there is an issue of whether aliases show as top-level
  objects or even display by default without a listing option.

* support for fillets and chamfers as object/combination operations

* image objects (tbd objects) for v5 geometry files

* material objects (non-geometric attribute-only objects) for v5
  geometry files.  instead of material attribute value becomes
  material object name.  material object encompasses hierarchical
  material traits.  some traits potentially of interest:
    - density
    - young modulus
    - yield strength (in different dirs, e.g., rolling & transversal)
    - ultimate tensile strength (also in different dirs)
    - Poisson's ratio
    - cost per ton?
    - ...

* parametric material properties.  support the ability to define
  material properties based on parametric values such as distance from
  surface, distance from medial axis, distance from centroid, distance
  from plane, etc.  this supports parametric descriptions of materials
  that have highly variable densities (e.g., bone, certain alloys and
  plastics, etc.).

* shader objects (non-geometric attribute-only objects) for v5
  geometry files.  allow shader string to refer to said objects for
  shader parameters.

* 3D plot objects for v5 geometry files.  very closely related to
  other ideas about having 3d wireframe objects, but these would
  probably be non-geometric in nature.  basically the plot3 files that
  are stored out to disk being stored as objects in the database with
  support for the overlay command to import, export, display them.

  minimally should probably support the basic drafting elements
  (predominantly from collada, dxf, iges, and step specifications):

	point := x, y, z
	line := start point, end point
	polyline := various (closed, open, paired, modified, etc.)
	circle := center point, radius
	ellipse := center point, major radius, minor radius
	hyperbola := center point, major radius, minor radius
	parabola := center point, focal length
	arc := center point, radius, start angle, end angle
	spline := degree, control points, knot values
	text := string, insertion point, size, style, alignment

The MGED points support doesn't appear as an executable, but it is
missing on Windows due to needing lex.


CONVERTERS
----------

* implement 3dm-g support for ON_InstanceRef entities.  These are
  instances of existing geometry that have prescribed referencing edit
  behavior and can have their own matrices.  Basically, they're combs
  that should sometimes reference copies of geometry and sometimes not
  (there's a flag).  unveiled via sf bug report 3575774 where the
  geometry export from solidworks was predominantly references
  resulting in a load of geometry missing after import and objects in
  the wrong position.

* make the converters export all top-level objects by default

* implement support for exporting sketch objects via g-iges

* validate primitives during export so that it is guaranteed that
  illegal primitives will not be written to file

* add csv, xml, nff, bzw, pov, blend geometry import and export support

* finish obj-g importer.  need to test more inputs and make sure all
  geometry is preserved on import in some form.  make sure new libobj
  parser works and is integrated with new front-end.

* implement a g-step exporter (with NURBS, implicit CSG, and NMG/BoT options)

* implement a g-dae (Collada) exporter and dae-g importer
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collada

* implement an x3d-g (Web3D, VRML successor) importer
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X3D

* implement a g-nc (g-code) exporter.  ideally this converts geometry
  to NURBS format, trims surfaces, evaluates boolean expressions, and
  then generates tool paths on resulting surfaces and interior paths.
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code

* implement a u3d-g importer
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_3D
  http://libharu.org/wiki/Main_Page

* implement a g-pdf exporter and/or open source 3D PDF library
  http://developer.techsoft3d.com/adobePDF/index.html

* SVG renderer.  go straight from 3D model to a 2D vector image for a
  given view.  similar to the plot/postscript wireframe view saves,
  this would need to store projected contours (ala rtedge) and filled
  color regions.

* implement a g-sat (Solidworks) exporter and sat-g importer
  http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/dataformats/sat/sat.pdf

* implement a g-ply exporter
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)

* implement a g-json exporter
  http://www.json.org/

* implement a g-xml exporter
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML

* implement a ls-dyna "keyword" file format importer.  perhaps extract
  as nmg/bot boundary representation meshes.  lots of great vehicle
  datasets at http://www.ncac.gwu.edu/vml/models.html


STEP
----

* add hierarchy preservation support to step-g

* document step-g

* implement g-step exporter (see above)

* see additional TODO items in file './src/other/step/README'


BREP/NURBS
----------

* create a BC_Brep class that inherits from ON_Brep so we can cleanly
  extend and implement functions that were intentionally removed from
  openNURBS.

* implement tessellation support.

* profile and optimize prep.  crazy slow.

* tighten up the bounding boxes around nurbs geometry.  seems to be
  bounding the untrimmed surfaces instead of the trimmed edges
  resulting in boxes (hopefully) larger than they need to be.

* update to openNURBS 5.0 (2011-02-02)

* identify useful concepts implemented in the old NURBS code that are not
  present in openNURBS, and port that code to openNURBS data structures
  and routines.  This will eventually allow us to remove the old NURBS code.

* document the new NURBS/BREP primitive, capabilities and limitations

* implement boolean evaluation of nurbs surfaces

* plate mode NURBS/BREP objects.  Similar, if not identical, to plate
  mode BoTs, 'brep' objects need the ability to have a thickness
  described so you could automatically handle non-solid NURBS and
  sheet-metal style geometry without requiring surface solidity.


NMG/BoT
-------

* implement conversion of plate-mode BoT into volume-mode BoT,
  probably as a 'bot' command subcommand.  this basically entails
  implementing the BoT tessellation callback for plate-mode which will
  let boolean evaluation succeed as-is.  might require adding a
  parameter in case we want to dump the mesh as-is.

* ensure robust and fast nmg->bot conversion

* facetize creates BoTs crappily by only looking at first region,
  first shell, instead of the whole nmg model.

* nmg_bot() and nmg_from_bot() only work with shells.  verify that all
  callers iterate over all shells or write a model version that does a
  complete conversion correctly.

* refactor all of the nmg processing (back) into its own library so
  that external users can manage mesh geometry without needing to pull
  in everything else in librt.  consider moving other polygonal
  specific logic to libnmg, eventually moving all polygonal logic out
  of librt, libtie, etc., and into libnmg.

* enhance the bot data structure to contain a generic pointer that
  could be used to point back to the NMG it was generated from.  This
  could allow ALL raytracing of polygonal models to use libtie/BoT
  raytracing routines, speeding up NMG raytracing and simplifying the
  raytracing code.

* optimization of NMG ray tracing.  the hitmiss bookkeeping presently
  used has a malloc/free occurring per shot().  allocations need to
  occur during prep only.  the presently render more than an order of
  magnitude slower than tracing that nmg converted to an equivalent
  BoT due to malloc/free calls being made during shot(). Confirmable
  with a simple test case of a sphere converted to an nmg:

    make sph sph ; facetize -n sph.nmg sph

* implement a routine/command to convert from a bot to an nmg
  (similar/related to the nmg-bot tool, but the reverse).

* need a simplified means to programmatically create and edit BoT
  meshes via the command line without resorting to get/put.


RTGL
----

Need before enabling:

Blasting havoc_tail when raytracing havoc doesn't result in a re-set
of the raytracing - it just re-sizes the view to havoc_tail and continues
with the original raytrace.  Track down why - should clear everything
and start over.  (Appears on Linux, not on OSX).

Need general robustness testing - ensure no crashes when switching
display manager types multiple times in multiple locations.

For cleanup:

Move pattern raytracing logic into librt.

Need a way to cache point data so we don't re-raytrace unchanged geometry
over and over.

Job server should be reworked into a general mechanism, instead of being
rtgl specific.

Provide a generic mechanism in MGED run loop to hook in features like
point cloud rendering, instead of hard-coding it.


LIBPC
-----

* BNF Parser for generation of constraint objects from expressions

* Make better pc_pc_set, pc_param and pc_constraint structures
instead of the current ugly ones.

* Test constraint solution via Read->Generate->Solve->Update routine

* Implement Non-deterministic solution techniques:  Backjumping,
Backmarking

* Implement Deterministic propagators: NC, AC1-7, PC1-5

* Check STL structures in public API ; wrapping with bu_list

* Boost constrained_value based functor integration for 'compiled'
constraints

* Implement Hypergraph representation system

* Explore analytic and symbolic solution system


INFRASTRUCTURE
--------------

* ensure successful build on mingw

* update the msvc build to not use installTree.tcl -- the build
  shouldn't really be reliant upon tclsh or be all contained within
  the tclsh project.  sub-projects should build and install by
  themselves (e.g. tkhtml3 should generate its htmltokens.h file).
  the "brlcad" project, if any, can build up the installation tree and
  generate the final installation exe.

* the binary windows installer is missing headers for our external
  dependencies (Tcl, zlib, and OpenNURBS in particular as the likes of
  bu.h and raytrace.h requires them)

* remove all of the MSVC sections in the CMakeLists.txt files.
  perform proper library/function/flag tests where necessary.

* ensure primary cmake option parity with summary option listing

  -- Um.  Not sure this is fully achieveable - we only want to
     summarize a subset of the src/other settings in the summary
     printout, was my (CY) understanding...

* investigate ignoring .hidden directories/files from dist packing so
  that internal build directories can be used instead of external ones

  -- is this needed?  what's not working with make package and
     make package_source?

* ensure it's possible to set global CFLAGS/CPPFLAGS/LDFLAGS that are
  in addition to any/all that we automatically set

* fix failure disabling IF_X when X11 headers are not found.
  include/fb.h still ends up entering the IF_X section and declaring a
  function that takes a Display and other X11 objects


THESE BREAK PROTOCOL OR ARE BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE
--------------------------------------------------

* change convention of using 'u', '+', and '-' for unions,
  intersections, and subtractions respectively to symbols that
  unambiguously describe the underlying CSG operation.

  '+', 'x', and '-' are the dominant ASCII option or (better) using
  unicode logic symbols for U and upside-down U.

  Union/Disjunction: + ∨ v u (logical OR)
  Intersection/Conjunction: x ∧ ^ . & n (logical AND)
  Subtraction/Difference: - (logical AND NOT)
  Negation/Complement: ! ¬ (logical NOT)

* remove the bspline primitive

* remove the poly primitive

* remove the hf primitive

* support for features either as primitives or operations or both
  e.g. chamfer, fillet, round, cut, etc.

* a cut feature edit.  implementation could be represented as the cube
  that bounds a geometry object.  eight points somewhere on the edges
  of the cube define an intersection volume on the object.  by
  default, the eight points could be positioned at the corners of the
  cube and would remain constrained to reside on one of the three
  adjoining edges for their respective corner.  this would provide a
  simple user interface where a face could be selected to move a cut
  plane through an object (moving four points along four edges), or an
  edge could be moved to move two points simultaneously, or each
  individual point could be moved along their edges to define the
  intersection object.  allowing the points to be deconstrained so
  they can move into the interior of the bounding volume or into the
  interior of a face could be an advanced option.

* fix the database I/O writing to properly support the addition of new
  primitive types.  this includes modifying the major/minor code or
  combinations/regions and binary objects

* add database support for constraints, expressions, parametric
  values, construction history, and timestamping.

* see the CHANGES file for items that have been marked as deprecated
  or available to be removed as obsolete items.

* make struct rt_functab's ft_label bigger and/or dynamic (e.g. vls)

* remove the storage of the never-implemented keypoint parameter for
  extrude objects.

* have all primitives record a transformation matrix so that they may
  retain a local coordinate system even after pushed matrices.  this
  also will allow primitives like the torus to support non-uniform
  scaling.

* rename 'part' primitive to 'pill' or remove it entirely in favor of
  a more generalized metaprimitive primitive.

* binary objects need to write out their minor type during export, not
  relying on the raw wrapper to encode it, so that proper
  import/export can be performed without relying on minor_type hacks
  in the API.

* implement support for binary attributes.  the idea is to allow
  arrays of {u,s}int{8,16,32,64}, float, double, and strings, typed as
  such when written out to storage.  this idea overlaps with what
  binunif objects provide, so need to reconcile and consolidate into
  one attribute object entity that can do everything a binunif can do,
  then allow attributes on objects to provide that same flexibility.

* change format of related programs (especially filters) so the
  input/output files are handled identically. two examples of
  different handling:

    png-pix   file.png > file.pix
    pix-bw  < file.pix > file.bw

  (desired style to be determined)


FUNCTIONALITY NEEDED TO SPEED UP RAYTRACING
-------------------------------------------

* merge shot and vshot

* implement bundles shot - array of rays

* separate ray structs - make fit in cache line

* refactor primitive data -  make fit in cache line

* implement SIMD shots

* implement SAH for all primitives (routine that fires a ray at each
  primitive for initial estimate, caches result)

* write and use kdtree - make traversal cache coherent


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

* break up library headers into subheaders so includes can be more
  specific (and help speed up compilation) and locally documented, but
  prevent subheaders from being directly included outside of our
  compilation (we don't want subdir filenames to become public API)

* move our public library headers into subdirs, e.g. include/bu/bu.h,
  so it's clear when you're using headers from another library and
  breaking encapsulation.

* make our C headers C++-convenient with proper extern "C" wrapping.

* add missing manual pages (tbrowder2 generated list 2013-08):

* DocBook: create a DB index.xml to generate a doc listing (with
  hot links) for the html and pdf collection

* DocBook source: add xsl customizations for figure and table title
  positions, float centering, etc.; add automatic figure, table, and
  other similar references; add separate markup for html (role='html')
  and pdf (role='fo') image sizing and placement; remove unnecessary
  image markup; lift child namespaces to each document's root element.

  Particular targets for improvement:

    doc/docbook/presentations/en/intro-to-tcltk.xml
    doc/docbook/specifications/en/BRL_CAD_g_format_V5.xml

* improve rtedge documentation, explain how it computes its "centroid"
  (as it's not exactly the center of bounding box of all objects -- it
  depends on the booleans).

* write up some documentation on other build tools besides make -
  CMake supports other generators, wouldn't hurt to detail how to
  trigger builds in them (MSVC is partially covered, make sure to
  coverage is complete - others include Eclipse, XCode once we get
  the kinks ironed out there, CodeBlocks.  New experimental ninja
  build tool and its (also experimental) CMake support are promising -
  if/when CMake support goes mainstream, document that too.)

* all of the rt* tracers share common code and common options, but do
  not share common documentation.  refactor documentation to use
  include directives so that there is one place where all of the
  common options are documented.  update usage statements to reflect
  commonality as well.

* Categorize the entity types from STEP * IGES into geometry,
  relationship definitions, metadata, etc., add any missing types
  of interest (like, say, metaballs) - try to create a comprehensive
  list of things we might need to consider when writing converters.

* document the saveview/loadview options.
