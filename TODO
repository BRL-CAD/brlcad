BRL-CAD to do list
==================

Included below is a list of things that are scheduled or desirable to
be done at some point.  Most recently added items are on top, older
topics are on the bottom.  This is not an official list, it's more a
scratch pad for the developers to use for tracking development ideas
and informal plans.

The items listed for release should not ever hinder, stop, or
otherwise delay a release from being made.  The items listed are
merely to give an estimate of what was expected to be done.  See the
project task tracker for more to do items and future planning efforts.

THESE SHOULD HAPPEN BEFORE THE NEXT RELEASE
-------------------------------------------

* restore functionality to tests and benchmark


THESE SHOULD HAPPEN WITHIN TWO RELEASE ITERATIONS
-------------------------------------------------

* get archer working

* clone and tracker

* ensure successful build on mingw

* Mac OS X SGI dial knobs support

* add geometry examples for toy jeep and building

* test pic/nonpic build problems with librtms/libmultispectral

* run-time path identification of mged resources was never completed,
  complete it.

* use environ for run-time path tracing lookups

* add support to restore the backups when an autogen.sh step aborts

* support variable overrides for autogen.sh


THESE ARE LOWER PRIORITY OR FOR FUTURE RELEASES
-----------------------------------------------

* center of presented area

* short introductory documentation on using various BRL-CAD command
  line tools such as rt, mged, nirt, fbserv, converters, etc.

* short introductory documentation on using mged, covering a majority
  of the various commands.

* reference sheet of useful BRL-CAD command-line tools grouped
  categorically.

* reference sheet of common mged commands, keybindings, gui elements
  and scripting facilities.

* support to the raytracers for multiple image file formats,
  recognizing an option and/or the file suffix of the -o filename.

* libfb + font rendering (perhaps through libbn's plot interface) for
  a posix terminal.

* gpgpu for enhanced performance boolweave sorting

* getexecname, "/proc/self/cmdline", program_invocation_short_name.
  separate out into new file.

* write an introduction to brl-cad document that overviews the primary
  tools and how they can be used together.

* test out -Wfloat-equal

* geometry viewing commands/visualizations of exploded levels

* add command line help options to 'benchmark' tool

* default mged text editor invokes ed, should invoke jove or system
  gui editor like TextEdit on OS X if it's known.

* mirror around an arbitrary plane (maybe point+vector) in mged

* mirror around point/distance along axis operation in mged

* librt-based path tracer

* system identifier application with sysctl-style information
  database, with some back-end functionality placed into libbu.

* write scripts that parse the sf.net tracker data and generate
  automatic reports for release.

* add callback data parameters to libpkg hook functions

* test intel compiler performance on Altix, add performance options

* pix-png should make sure output is not to a terminal

* investigate performance impact of using sched_setaffinity and/or
  pthread_attr_setaffinity_np for linux threading affinity in librt.

* rtedge-style tracer that outputs tool paths (splines/segments, etc)
  for CNC/CAM style toolpath cutting descriptions (g-code files).

* rt annotation support

* support for fillets and chamfers as object/combination operations

* M-x indent-region scripts

* provide installation and post configuration support scripts

* make the DSP primitive use less memory when data is coming from
  a binunif. allocating 160 times binunif size is a bit extravagant
  (which comes from sizeof(struct dsp_bb)).

* add dynamic geometry support. i.e. the ability to modify the parsed
  in-memory geometry tree on the fly via api calls (e.g. to add holes)

* convert the documentation to docbook and integrate their generation
  with the build system.

* investigate why g-iges followed by iges-g on a single box results in
  permuted vertex lists

* fix reference to a "Create Solid" submenu on pdf page 18 (page 6) of
  volume II

* write up the history of brlcad

* obliterate compilation warnings

* add support for subgeometry support to the geometry syndicator

* add xml, nff, bzw, pov, blend geometry import and export support

* add support for filesystem-based geometry collections

* add support for levels of detail


ODDITIES
--------

* the scale structure in bn_cmd_noise_slice (bn_tcl.c) was never
  initialized. it looks like somebody has planned to extend the
  function but never carried out


THESE BREAK PROTOCOL OR ARE BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE
--------------------------------------------------

* support for features either as primitives or operations or both
  e.g. chamfer, fillet, round, etc

* fix the database I/O writing to properly support the addition of new
  primitive types.  this includes modifying the major/minor code or
  combinations/regions and binary objects

* add database support for constraints, expressions, parametric
  values, construction history, and timestamping.
