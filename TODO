BRL-CAD To Do List
==================

This document contains a collection of desirable BRL-CAD development
tasks.  Included is a list of the tasks expected for the current
monthly development release iteration, tasks that will hopefully be
completed within two iterations, and a remaining "backlog" of
unscheduled development tasks.

This is not an official list of tasks that will be completed.  Instead
it's more like a developer scratch pad for recording ideas and
coordinating release tasks.  At the beginning of each month,
developers add the tasks they expect to complete and then remove those
tasks as they are completed.


THESE TASKS SHOULD HAPPEN BEFORE THE NEXT RELEASE
-------------------------------------------------

* oof.


THESE TASKS SHOULD HAPPEN WITHIN TWO RELEASE ITERATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------

* fix mged EDITOR invocation bug.  have to reconcile src/mged/editit.c
  and src/libged/editit.c where the latter had the libdm dependency
  removed.  that refactoring subsequently killed all of the logic used
  to know when to invoke the editor from within an xterm, which hangs
  mged since the user can't actually see/access the detached editor.

* vls name wrapping (reversible argv-to-vls, vls-to-argv)

* 64-bit port of BRL-CAD on Windows

* annotation primitive.  specifically a means to create an object in
  the database that can optionally be associated with an object and/or
  location that a label refers to.  there are various styles such as
  a single line from a point to text and two lines (e.g., indicating
  measurement) to text.  the object should allow for different line
  styles including having no lines.  there should also be support for
  view-fixed or view-independent annotation placement (which requires
  a change to plot()'s and possibly prep()'s signature).  it would
  also be useful to allow an optional "thickness" so that the
  annotations can represent physical geometry (so they raytrace).

* deprecate dbfind - ensure functionality is fully captured by the
  search command, make it report a deprecation statement on use and
  utilize search under the hood.

* refactor rt_functab accessors to go through an api call or calls so
  that the array is not accessed directly.  either an rt_eval() style
  interface with data-driven keys to tell it with function(s) to call,
  or simply have an rt_*() for each function (e.g., rt_mirror(),
  rt_shot(), rt_describe(), etc).

* finish obj-g importer.  need to test more inputs and make sure all
  geometry is preserved on import in some form.

* fix metaball "shelling" but that causes the primitive to invert and
  just give paper thin surface (something wrong in the intersection).

* fix src/librt/roots.c exact floating point comparison issue and
  tight tolerance problems.  See !!! comments.


THESE ARE UNSCHEDULED BACKLOG TASKS
-----------------------------------

* investigate impact of using lookup tables for root solving.
  implement lookup tables for a range of linear, quadratic, cubic, and
  quartic polynomial coefficients.  compare performance to root
  solving without lookups.  evaluate memory use.  non-imaginary roots
  are relatively sparse, may need to consider linked lists, hash
  tables, or some hybrid storage arrangement.  Idea inspired by:
  http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/

* make the 'tables' ged command not call system() on the "sort" unix
  command.  It should perform all sorting on the data directly in
  memory, at least without creating another process.

* make libwdb routines not free user-allocated memory.  notably
  mk_nmg() and mk_sketch() but probably others as well.

* libbn's tri_specific structure requires user-provided memory for
  normals.. this certainly saves memory if the triangles don't have
  normals but at a rather expensive malloc cost (which is being seen
  on large BoT models) during prep.

* make fbclear and raytrace control panel obey a -F advanced option,
  i.e., better remote framebuffer support.

* MINOR: rename bu_ptbl(), nmg_struct_counts()
  (c++ portability, hides struct constructor)

* MINOR: add tolerance parameters to the bn_*() functions that have
  near-zero tests.

* verify/improve kicking off an EDITOR in mged so that we don't lock
  up mged in vim/emacs/jove/whatever without a controlling terminal,
  without breaking the ability to set a GUI editor like TextEdit,
  Wordpad, etc.

* Simple GUI for repairing BoT normals.  Basically make it easier to
  make all normals consistent and outward facing through some form of
  MGED integration of bot_sync and bot_flip.

* Machine-independent dbupgrade.  Make it so that dbupgrade will work
  on an old v4 without being on a machine of the same original
  architecture type.

* complete conversion of existing manual pages into docbook format

* expose all manual page documentation from within mged through
  searchable viewer interface (GUI)

* add support to 'mv' (and possibly friends like mvall) for renaming
  objects based on a mapping file.  Primarily of benefit to imported
  geometries, this would introduce a renaming capability similar to
  rcodes, idents, and other similar commands that provide file-based
  collective name editing.

* add an option to bot_dump for outputting surface normals.  Make sure
  all supported dump formats (obj, dxf, etc) optionally write out
  normals.  Consider adding an option to smoothly interpolate normals
  (per face or vertex).

* add option to push/xpush to stop at the region level.

* consolidate push/xpush together

* verify/fix/improve rtarea.  There are reports that the rtarea
  command may have a bug in its calculations.  This needs to be
  investigated along with a review of the taxonomy used by rtarea for
  describing presented/projected areas.

* make sca command accept three arguments for x/y/z.

* obliterate verbose compilation warnings

* modify g_qa to search for >1 region flag in a tree path.

* the binary windows installer is missing headers for our external
  dependencies (Tcl, zlib, and OpenNURBS in particular as the likes of
  bu.h and raytrace.h requires them)

* make rtarea display a cross-hair and perhaps coordinates for the
  center of area if run from within mged.

* optimization of NMG ray tracing.  the hitmiss bookkeeping presently
  used has a malloc/free occuring per shot().  allocations need to
  occur during prep only.  the presently render more than an order of
  magnitude slower than tracing that nmg converted to an equivalent
  BoT due to malloc/free calls being made during shot(). Confirmable
  with a simple test case of a sphere converted to an nmg:

    make sph sph ; facetize -n sph.nmg sph

* implement a "select" command in LIBGED that creates a selection set
  based on specified sampling parameters or object lists.  example
  could be "select -point 12.3 23.1 31.2 -dist 100.0" to
  select objects within a given distance of a point; "select foo bar"
  to select specific objects and create/return a temporary reference
  name. this provides a command-line mechanism for implementing band
  selection in the GUI, area-based selections, and object highlighting
        - can replace unpublished 'sphgroup' command with this

* make gqa overlap reporting suck less.  uselessly reports the same
  objects multiple times instead of keeping track of uniquely
  overlapping pairs of objects (rtcheck used to have this problem but
  not now).  also reports overlaps even when not requested (e.g. -Aa)

* refactor the libtclcad go_*() functions and invocation wrappers
  (also in mged) into libged where appropriate. the 'png' command
  comes to mind.

* refactor and manage libbn tolerance uses by providing an interface
  default (e.g., an init macro) and making everyone use that where it
  is hardcoded to 0.0005 presently (and a few places where it's
  inconsistently/incorrectly 0.005).

* add a default phong 'metal' shader.  annoying to keep making plastic
  more reflective or mirror less reflective when it's such a common
  material appearance to want.

* implement a new tool/command that reports summary information about
  a geometry file including number of objects, types of objects,
  classes of geometry representation types used, and potentially more.

* add an option to mv/mvall to take input from a mapping file.
  relates to sf feature request 2827957 from butler.  should be
  something along the lines of simple file parsing such as the
  following:

  # this line is a comment
  foo bar
  "big foo" "big bar"
  foobar "foo bar"  # another comment, replacing foobar with 'foo bar'

* consider adding an option to reid/remat and edcodes (and others?) to
  ignore negative regions (regions subtracted from regions or
  intersected with them) since, while bad practice, are valid
  geometrically.

* implement some sort of archive/backup command in mged in order to
  save the currently open database out to a file.

* make sure there are no getenv() non-NULL assumptions within the
  code.  might want to see if there's a pattern of variables being
  checked such that a libbu interface would be warranted (e.g.,
  instead of checking HOME, having a bu_find_directory(BU_USER_HOME)
  routine or similar facility) for finding common resource locations.

* add support for a zoom/viewsize option to rt so you can adjust the
  image scale without having to feed a view script.

* make db_open modes behave the same as the fopen() modes (i.e.,
  create the .g if one doesn't exist when write mode)

* fix the shaders.sh regression test case, failing dues to changes
  with mged's view initialization.

* inside support for ARS

* add support to 'rtxray' for outputting inverted pixel values so that
  we have pixel values that are directly related to material thickness

* g_qa (gqa in mged) needs to be more informative when it runs - 
  needs a header letting you know what it's doing, and if possible
  a "progress report" for longer runs that provides some notion of
  how much of the total job is done.

* make color and vectors on pnts work

* mged inconsistently ignores signals.  initially allowing mged to be
  backgrounded, but then later ignores them.  needs to consistently
  ignore or not ignore them, ideally the latter.

* libfb needs to have the fb_open/close_existing functions refactored
  into the function table and hav the #ifdef sections removed.

* integrate library tester into regression suite that validates
  exported library symbols published in headers.  make sure they at
  least exist and maybe even try to ensure they will run with null
  arguments without crashing.

* 3D plot objects for v5 geometry files.  very closely related to
  other ideas about having 3d wireframe objects, but these would
  probably be non-geometric in nature.  basically the plot3 files that
  are stored out to disk being stored as objects in the database with
  support for the overlay command to import, export, display them.

  minimally should probably support the basic drafting elements
  (predominantly from collada, dxf, iges, and step specifications):

        point := x, y, z
        line := start point, end point
        polyline := various (closed, open, paired, modified, etc)
        circle := center point, radius
        ellipse := center point, major radius, minor radius
        hyperbola := center point, major radius, minor radius
        parabola := center point, focal length
        arc := center point, radius, start angle, end angle
        spline := degree, control points, knot values
        text := string, insertion point, size, style, alignment

* make _plot() callbacks fill in plot objects instead of returning
  line segments.

* image objects (tbd objects) for v5 geometry files

* material objects (non-geometric attribute-only objects) for v5
  geometry files.  instead of material attribute value becomes
  material object name.  material object encompasses hierarchical
  material traits.

* shader objects (non-geometric attribute-only objects) for v5
  geometry files.  allow shader string to refer to said objects for
  shader parameters.

* refactor wdb_obj and view_obj in libged.  with the de-tcl'ing of the
  base libs, it should disappear but shouldn't have wdb_*() funcs in
  libged regardless.  work in progress.

* make our C headers C++-convenient with proper extern "C" wrapping.

* reorganize the header files in include so it is clear which headers
  pertain to which libraries.

* break up library headers into subheaders so includes can be more
  specific (and help speed up compilation) and locally documented.

* fix framebuffer refresh bug.  problem was caused when the if_ogl
  framebuffer was changed (back) to request a direct rendering
  context.  presumably that is triggering other code that is failing
  to redraw.

* implement a routine/command to convert from a bot to an nmg
  (similar/related to the nmg-bot tool, but the reverse).

* implement a jitter-style option to rt that makes it average the ray
  results to take a weighted light contribution for a given
  resolution.  saves more memory over rendering at 2x/4x/8x/whatever
  with or without jitter and then scaling down.  present jitter option
  doesn't average.

* refactor mged/bwish/g_diff initialization to all use the same routine

* rename all the g_* tools sans _ next minor update

* deprecate either orot or rotobj

* refactor mged's signal handling to make it possible to safely
  interrtupt long-running commands

* add a -color option to all mged commands that draw geometry (B, eid,
  and E come to mind)

* have mged record a timestamped command history by default

* implement -exec support for 'search' command

* implement -param support for 'search' command

* make ged command names aware of object arguments for automatic
  globbing and regular expression expansion:
	attr set t 1 [regex .*\.r]
	attr set t 1 [glob *.r]
	attr set t 1 *.r

* mged crashes on Mac if using system Tcl/Tk with our incrTcl.
  crashes with the following stack (same whether dm-X or dm-ogl):
	XQueryExtension
	...
	glxGetConfig
	ogl_choose_visual (dm-ogl.c:1359)
	ogl_open (dm-ogl.c:401)
	dm_open (dm-generic:82)

* review adding support for infix and postfix CSG operators for
  libged/mged.  be sure to revive or at least check out the previous
  effort in src/mged/comb_bool_parse.y that already has support that
  recognizes the classical infix notation.

* readd support for vrml v1 to g-vrml so that users can select whether
  they want v2 (default) or previous v1 output format via a
  command-line switch.  see http://brlcad.svn.sf.net/viewvc/brlcad/brlcad/trunk/conv/g-vrml.c?view=diff&pathrev=22798&r1=16900&r2=16901 

* VRML importer

* make Mac OS X universal binaries actually work.

* implement analyze for all primitives lacking an implementation

* implement general analyze estimate (perhaps just raytrace it) for
  primitives where values like surface area are very difficult to
  calculate.

* move analyze logic into librt (with their respective primitives).

* fix analyze output formatting, columns are pooched.

* extend analyze output formatting to user-specified formats ala nirt

* implement tessellation support for the new BREP primitive.

* implement make, ted, edsol, mirror, and analyze for revolve
  primitive.  implement tess() too.

* fix/change naming convention for presented/exposed area

* re-enable RISE client in ADRT

* test homovulgaris' root solver patch that puts coefficients in the
  right order

* review librt polynomial root solver (cubic and quadratic case)

* give bot-bldxf the axe (reconcile and merge with bot_dump)

* refactor all of the nmg processing (back) into its own library so
  that external users can manage mesh geometry without needing to pull
  in everything else in librt

* implement support for exporting sketch objects via g-iges

* implement mged object name globbing similar to tclsh's globbing
  (i.e. via a globbing command and quoting globs that use []).  testing
  shows db_glob doesn't seem to behave correctly, at least not like
  glob.  hook globbing into all commands so glob_compat_mode
  statefulness can go away.  a db_glob expression that doesn't match
  anything should not return the expression.

* Explore possibility of "level of detail" wireframe renderings,
  possibly using the previous "smooth" wireframe work as a start,
  to provide better visualization of models.

* come up with a new tool that automatically generates "inside"
  regions for a given model as a way to automatically model air.
  particularly useful for bot models where the inside air compartment
  is predominantly (but not entirely) a complex bot structure in
  itself.  idea is to use some sort of marching cubes/tets to find
  those volumes, perhaps use a libified g_qa.

* extend metaball control info beyond simple points (e.g., line
  segments)

* address the TODO items in src/mged/clone.c

* investigate why solids.sh fails on three pixels on some 64-bit
  platforms. it grazingly hits/misses a tgc causing a regression
  failure.

* develop a low-level tool for investigating, reporting statistics on,
  and repairing geometry database files.  the tool should nominally
  perform big/little endian conversions, report number and types of
  objects, allow deletion/undeletion/hiding/unhiding, provide some
  general means to manipulate the packed and unpacked .g file data for
  performing low-level modifications

* fix the "(type)(size_t)val" hacks (using ints like ptrs, etc)

* fix rt parallel crash
  (true ; while [ $? -eq 0 ] ; do rt -o /dev/null moss.g all.g ; done)

* fix parallel crash report generation (multiple BU_MAPPED_FILE's
  getting acquired)

* make closing both the command window and graphics window shut down
  mged (i.e., fix unintentional behavior)

* remove hit_normal and hit_point from struct hit.  add RT_HIT_POINT
  macro.  refactor all callers as needed.

* make bombardier actually send the report somewhere

* hook bombardier in for crash reporting

* windows smp support

* modify the new tree traversal code to be generic

* add high dynamic range image support to the framebuffers

* add alpha channel support to the framebuffers

* remote framebuffer timeout support (perhaps as ::key=val;key=val)

* develop a tool that applies a text overlay to a given rendered image
  (e.g., as an rt option) for things like adding an image title, the
  az/el, and objects displayed.

* implement a lighting model for rt that visualizes how expensive each
  individual pixel is to compute with an intensity (heat graph)

* bezier extrusions need to be optimized, really should not be
  performing dynamic memory allocation in the root solver

* better/consistent argument processing supporting both long and short
  option names, perhaps using argtable

* decouple libdm from librt -- just one file in libdm uses librt,
  including a whole nasty primitive switch statement.  need to push
  that back over into librt.

* Implement an optical shader for the new "pixelated" military
  camouflage style

* preserve an arb8 as an arb8 (instead of writing as arb6 or arb5) and
  similarly for the other arb# sizes

* validate primitives during export so that it is guaranteed that
  illegal primitives will not be written to file

* implement a region annointment command where the user can turn an
  assembly into a region and change all lower or higher regions into
  combinations

* enhance dxf-g to create more than just one combination per layer,
  creating multiple objects for the individual objects in the dxf file
  (instead of one conglomerate BoT)

* add an overlap depth reporting tolerance parameter to the
  ray-tracers (similar to -R).

* Generate plain .zip files for Windows binary releases

* fix the variety of ami.tcl and ampi.tcl tclscript warnings/errors

* run indent.sh on directories (one at a time, validating results)

* add support for arbitrary matrix transformations to torus primitive.
  store non-uniform scaling matrices as an attribute for
  backwards-compatible support until v6.

* configure support to enable/disable framebuffers, display
  managers, geometry converters, and image converters.  consider
  apache's module management as an example.

* review and merge in the rest of the GSI modifications

* make target and/or script to update ChangeLog and version
  information, possibly including checking for consistency, to
  facilitate release process.

* display the current mode in mged graphics window

* Optional compile-time support for using GMP or CLN for arbitrary
  exact precision arithmetic computation support

* inside/outside point and voxel testing capability in librt

* automatic geometry voxelizer (perhaps using arbs or vol primitive)

* turn geometry converters and image converters into libraries
  (started as libraries libgcv and libicv)

* add support for querying geometry properties to library including
  computing surface area and weight/mass.

* add verification and validation tests confirming behavior of the
  ray-tracer and computations of area, mass, volume, etc

* testing suite for all binaries: for cmd2 in $(for cmd in `find . -name Makefile.am | xargs cat | perl -pi -e 's/\\\\\n//g'| grep -E "PROGRAMS ?=" | sed 's/.*=//g'` ; do echo $cmd ; done | sort | uniq ) ; do echo command: $cmd2 ; done

* add geometry example of building 238

* Mac OS X SGI dial knobs support

* ability to "unpush" objects, translating them to a new position and
  applying the correct matrix (using either bounding box or center of
  mass, for example).  would be useful to optionally allow the
  creation of a parent combination that contains the unpushed matrix
  so you could return primitives to local coordinates.  See sf feature
  request 2826720 from cericole.

* ensure successful build on mingw

* test for USE_FORKED_THREADS in configure

* optimize CSG structures automatically: automatic simplification,
  tree contraction, null object detection.

* option to mged make command or new command that enters solid edit
  mode, "med", "smake", "makes", "msed", etc.  same for cp command.

* have libbu report memory allocation statistics so the exact amount
  of memory requirements for a geometry database can be computed on
  the fly via a pre-prep phase.

* support to the raytracers for multiple image file formats,
  recognizing an option and/or the file suffix of the -o filename.

* libfb + font rendering (perhaps through libbn's plot interface) for
  a posix terminal.

* gpgpu for enhanced performance boolweave sorting

* getexecname, "/proc/self/cmdline", program_invocation_short_name.
  separate out into new file.

* geometry viewing commands/visualizations of exploded levels

* librt-based path tracer

* system identifier application with sysctl-style information
  database, with some back-end functionality placed into libbu.

* add callback data parameters to libpkg hook functions

* add performance options for the intel compiler on Altix

* investigate performance impact of using sched_setaffinity and/or
  pthread_attr_setaffinity_np for linux threading affinity in librt.

* rtedge-style tracer that outputs tool paths (splines/segments, etc)
  for CNC/CAM style toolpath cutting descriptions (g-code files).

* rtedge shoots twice as many rays as it needs to (shoots the 'below'
  ray for each primary, only reusing current scanline cells.

* support for fillets and chamfers as object/combination operations

* make the DSP primitive use less memory when data is coming from
  a binunif. allocating 160 times binunif size is a bit extravagant
  (which comes from sizeof(struct dsp_bb)).

* add dynamic geometry support. i.e. the ability to modify the parsed
  in-memory geometry tree on the fly via api calls (e.g. to add holes)

* investigate why g-iges followed by iges-g on a single box results in
  permuted vertex lists

* add xml, nff, bzw, pov, blend geometry import and export support

* add support for filesystem-based geometry collections

* modify the raytracers to use common fb and file output code

* add missing manual pages (jra generated list on 04.2007):
	a-d archer asc2g asc2pix binfo bot-bldxf bottest brep_cube brep_simple brickwall btclsh burst bw-a bw-d bwish c-d chan_add clutter contours d-a damdf dauto dauto2 d-bw dconv ddisp d-f dfft d-i dmod double-asc dpeak dsel dsp_add dstat d-u dwin euclid_format euclid_unformat fbgammamod f-d fence fhor f-i files-tape g-adrt g-euclid1 g-jack globe g-off i-a i-d i-f ihist imod ipuscan ipustat istat jack-g kurt lowp molecule msrandom mst nmgmodel nmg-sgp off-g pipe pipetest pix2g pix3filter pixcount pixelswap pixembed pixfields pixfieldsep pixflip-fb pix-ipu pixpaste pix-spm pix-yuv plstat png-ipu pyramid rawbot remapid rlesortmap rletovcr room rtcell rtexample rtfrac rtrad rtsil rtsrv rtwizard script-tab sgi-pix sketch solshoot sphflake spltest spm-fb ssampview syn tea tea_nmg testfree texturescale torii ttcp tube txyz-pl u-a u-bw u-d u-f umod ustat vcrtorle vegitation wall wdb_example xbmtorle xyz-pl yuv-pix

* design plugin system to allow domain specific tools (say, for example,
  a tool to create propeller parts) to identify themselves and their
  features to BRL-CAD, and to allow BRL-CAD to incorporate those features
  as an integrated part of interaction environments.  

* SVG renderer.  go straight from 3D model to a 2D vector image for a
  given view.  similar to the plot/postscript wireframe view saves,
  this would need to store projected contours (ala rtedge) and filled
  color regions.

* see if it is possible to use tec/ehy primitives to create a proc-db
  for airfoil/wing shapes.  Interesting possibilities with boolean combinations
  of these primitives, provided their continuity at the ends ensures
  continuity all along "seams" - something to consider.

LIBPC
-----

* BNF Parser for generation of constraint objects from expressions

* Make better pc_pc_set, pc_param and pc_constraint structures
instead of the current ugly ones.

* Test constraint solution via Read->Generate->Solve->Update routine 

* Implement Non-deterministic solution techniques:  Backjumping,
Backmarking

* Implement Deterministic propagators: NC, AC1-7, PC1-5

* Check STL structures in public API ; wrapping with bu_list

* Boost constrained_value based functor integration for 'compiled' 
constraints

* Implement Hypergraph representation system

* Explore analytic and symbolic solution system


ODDITIES
--------

* the scale structure in bn_cmd_noise_slice (bn_tcl.c) was never
  initialized. it looks like somebody has planned to extend the
  function but never carried out


THESE BREAK PROTOCOL OR ARE BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE
--------------------------------------------------

* support for features either as primitives or operations or both
  e.g. chamfer, fillet, round, etc

* fix the database I/O writing to properly support the addition of new
  primitive types.  this includes modifying the major/minor code or
  combinations/regions and binary objects

* add database support for constraints, expressions, parametric
  values, construction history, and timestamping.

* see doc/deprecation.txt for items that have been marked as
  deprecated or available to be removed as obsolete items.

* make struct rt_functab's ft_label bigger and/or dynamic (e.g. vls)

* remove the storage of the never-implemented keypoint parameter for
  extrude objects.

* have all primitives record a transformation matrix so that they may
  retain a local coordinate system even after pushed matrices.  this
  also will allow primitives like the torus to support non-uniform
  scaling.

* rename 'part' primitive to 'pill' or remove it entirely in favor of
  a more generalized metaprimitive primitive.

* binary objects need to write out their minor type during export, not
  relying on the raw wrapper to encode it, so that proper
  import/export can be performed without relying on minor_type hacks
  in the API.


FUNCTIONALITY NEEDED TO SPEED UP RAYTRACING
-------------------------------------------

* merge shot and vshot

* implement bundles shot - array of rays

* separate ray structs - make fit in cache line

* refactor primitive data -  make fit in cache line

* implement SIMD shots

* implement SAH for all primitives

* write and use kdtree - make traversal cache coherent
