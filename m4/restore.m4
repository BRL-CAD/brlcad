# BC_RESTORE_CLOBBERED
#
# restores a file that has been backed up to a directory if the contents
# have changed.  if the files have Revision numbers, those are used to
# determine which file is newer.
#
# an automake bug in older versions will clobber existing COPYING and
# INSTALL files, so those are common files that need to be restored.
