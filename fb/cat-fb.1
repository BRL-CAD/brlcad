.TH CAT-FB 1 BRL-CAD
.SH NAME
cat\(hyfb \(em display a troff C/A/T document on a framebuffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cat-fb
.RB [ \-hcoO ]
.RB [ \-F\  framebuffer]
.RB [ \-C\  r/g/b]
.RB [ \-{sS}\  squarescrsize]
.RB [ \-{wW}\  scr_width]
.RB [ \-{nN}\  scr_height]
[troff_files]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I cat-fb
reads a
.IR troff (1)
C/A/T phototypesetter document
from the named file(s), or from
standard in if no file is specified.
The document is converted to a bitmap using the
Berkeley font files from /usr/lib/vfont and
.IR libfont (3),
and is either displayed 
on the currently selected framebuffer,
or output as a
.IR pix (5)
format image.
The environment variable FB_FILE specifies
the current framebuffer, see
.IR brlcad (1).
Alternatively, the framebuffer may be explicitly specified
by using the
.B \-F
flag.
.PP
By default,
the requested framebuffer size is assumed to be 512x512 pixels.
Specifying the
.B \-h
flag changes the size to 1024x1024.
.PP
The
.BI \-w\  scr_width
and
.BI \-W\  scr_width
flags specifies the width of each scanline for the display device,
in pixels.
.PP
The
.BI \-n\  scr_height
and
.BI \-N\  scr_height
flags specifies the height of each scanline for the display device.
.PP
.BI \-s\  squarescrsize
and
.BI \-S\  squarescrsize
set both the height and width to the size given.
.PP
By default, the text bitmaps are overlaid on top of the
image resident in the current framebuffer.
However, the
.B \-c
flag causes the screen to be cleared before the image is displayed.
The
.B \-O
flag specifies that the background image is to be read instead
from standard input.  This forces the
.IR troff (1)
input to be stored in a temporary file which is given as a parameter.
If the
.B \-o
flag is given, then no framebuffer operations are performed, and
the output image is written to standard output.
If this option is specified, and the
.B \-O
option is not given, then the
.B \-c
(clear) operation is silently forced.
.PP
The default color of the text is full intensity white.
This can be changed by specifying the text color option
.BI \-C r/g/b
where each of "r", "g", and "b" represent integers from 0 to 255,
and the slashes (``/'') are entered literally.
.SH NOTES
Because the way that text is processed (top to bottom) is different
from the way that
.IR pix (5)
files are processed (bottom to top), any
.IR pix (5)
files input or output will need to be processed with an
inversion
.B \-i
flag on other tools.
.SH EXAMPLES
Simple white on black typesetting:
.sp .5
  tbl files | eqn | troff -t - | cat-fb -c
.LP
Typesetting on top of a nice shaded background:
.sp .5
  tbl files | eqn | troff -t - > doc.tr
  pixbackgnd -i 160 200 | cat-fb -O doc.tr
.LP
Typesetting upside-down:
.sp .5
  tbl files | eqn | troff -t - | cat-fb -o | pix-fb

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
``cat-fb: -O ignored, stdin used for C/A/T code''.
An attempt was made to take both the overlay picture and
the C/A/T code from stdin.
.PP
``cat-fb:  X off right edge of screen''.
An attempt was made to typeset the character ``X'' beyond the right
edge of the screen/file.
