BRL-CAD Contributors
====================

The BRL-CAD development team would like to take this opportunity to
thank the many people and organizations who have contributed to make
BRL-CAD the package it is today.

BRL-CAD was originally conceived and written, for the most part, by
the late Michael John Muuss.  He is our original primary architect and
author.  His work lives on in testament to his intellect and
indomitable spirit through the contributions and improvements by
others.

Over the years, Mike and the Advanced Computer Systems Team at the
U.S. Army Research Laboratory (* see note) as well as many others
around the world worked on developing BRL-CAD.  In December 2004,
BRL-CAD development was opened and expanded with the conversion to
Open Source.

We strive to accurately and completely recognize the groups and
individuals that have helped make BRL-CAD the package it is today.
Contributors are grouped together and ordered chronologically with the
earliest named first; likewise, the more recent contributors are
listed at the bottom.

Names are optionally followed by the date of their first contribution
and a list of affiliations.  Individuals supporting and contributing
to the project on their own time and of their own accord have an
affiliation listed as "Open Source".

BRL-CAD is the collective effort of many contributors (** see note).
Developers are characterized as individuals that have made substantial
contributions (hundreds or even thousands of features) to the project
over an extended period of time (years or even decades).  Other
contributor credits are organized into the following general
categories depending on the level and type of involvement:

  * Mathematical, Algorithmic, and Geometric Support
  * Documentation Writers
  * Code Contributors
  * Special Thanks

Participation and contributions are graciously appreciated and
credited in following.
