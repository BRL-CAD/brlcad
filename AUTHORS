BRL-CAD Contributors
====================

The BRL-CAD development team would like to take this opportunity to
thank the many people and organizations who have contributed to make
BRL-CAD the package that it is today.

BRL-CAD was originally conceived and written for the most part by the
late Michael John Muuss.  He is the original primary architect and
author.  The package has since been improved upon over the years by
Mike and the Advanced Computer Systems Team at the U.S. Army Research
Laboratory (* see note), as well as by many others around the world.
His work lives on in testament to his intellect and indomitable spirit
through the contributions and improvements by others.  We strive to
recognize those groups and individuals that have helped make BRL-CAD
the package that it is today here.

Contributions of this large collective work are separated into a few
major sections depending on the level and type of involvement that the
individual maintained.  Contributors are roughly ordered
chronologically for each section, depending upon when involvement with
BRL-CAD began.  The earliest contributors are named first; likewise,
the most recent contributors are listed at the bottom.

Names are optionally followed by the organizations that may have
supported their involvement to some degree, also listed in
chronological order.  Many individuals including many with affiliated
organizations have also supported the package of their own accord and
on their own time.  Participation and contributions are graciously
appreciated.

Active developers are denoted with an "**", meaning that they have
been actively involved within the past 12 months.
