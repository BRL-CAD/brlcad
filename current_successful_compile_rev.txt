32075, sans:
	 change to libged/Makefile.am from 31282 that somehow got incorporated in 32048.
svn merge -r 32048:32047 on that one file

32082, sans:
	changes to configure.ac in 32082 that incorporated the new tutorials directory without it being present and misc/win32-msvc9 without it being included, src/libpc ditto - may want to revert that configure inclusion and do a more selective commit of its contents.

32085,86 - incorporated change from 31629 somewhere in here that breaks things in extrude.c
      Sync up to this point, then redo the merge and commit of this stage from trunk while taking more care about what gets in extrude.c
      Same deal with pipe.c, sketch.c
      raytrace.h change is a problem here too.
