Per https://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2019-June/069643.html investigate

If we're converting to git anyway, that would be considerably simpler.
Just need to make sure we can use git apply on vanilla source hierarchies
that aren't themselves git repositories...

An example use:  https://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2019-June/069669.html
