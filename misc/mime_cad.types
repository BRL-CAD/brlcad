# This file maps CAD media types to file extension(s).
#
# Some of these extensions are not unique when integrated with the global mime
# type paradigm - for example, obj is listed in the general mapping as
# application/x-tgif but in the CAD context should be model/obj.  This will be
# handled by the libbu calling function, which will accept a context
# (application, image, text, model, etc.) within which it will interpret the
# extension.  The fixed requirement is that a file extension be unique
# within its context - for example, "stl" can not map to two different
# model MIME types.
#
# This file is formatted in the style of the Apache mime.types file, but
# defines types specific to the CAD domain rather than those defined per RFC
# 4288.  If a mapping is added to the main mime.types file which makes one of
# the entries here redundant, the entry in this file should be removed.
#
# This file is in the public domain.
