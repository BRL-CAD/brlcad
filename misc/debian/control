Description: BRL-CAD open source solid modeling
 BRL-CAD is a powerful cross-platform Open Source combinatorial
 Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) solid modeling system that
 includes interactive 3D solid geometry editing, high-performance
 ray-tracing support for rendering and geometric analysis,
 network-distributed framebuffer support, image and signal-processing
 tools, path-tracing and photon mapping support for realistic image
 synthesis, a system performance analysis benchmark suite, an embedded
 scripting interface, and libraries for robust high-performance
 geometric representation and analysis.
