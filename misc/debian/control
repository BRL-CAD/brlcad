Description: Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) solid modeling system, binary files
 BRL-CAD is a powerful cross-platform open source combinatorial
 Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) solid modeling system that includes
 an interactive 3D solid geometry editor, a network-distributed
 symmetric multiprocessing high-performance ray-tracer,
 network-distributed framebuffer support, image and signal-processing
 tools, ray-tracing support for rendering and geometric analysis,
 path-tracing and photon mapping support for realistic image synthesis,
 animation capabilities, ray-tracing and numerical processing
 libraries, a system performance analysis benchmark suite, an embedded
 scripting interface, and a robust high-performance geometric
 representation and analysis library.
