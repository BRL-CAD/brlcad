#
#  This logic defines cross platform build testing for BRL-CAD using
#  Github's "Actions" mechanism.
#
#  We define a setup similar to https://github.com/cristianadam/HelloWorld/
#
#  Github has a time limit on these tests, and we also don't want to stress the
#  system too heavily (particularly if we want to run them per-commit.)   For
#  testing purposes we're currently using distcheck, but for eventual
#  production use we need to change our build targets to something more
#  streamlined.  It is probably also worth disabling step and gdal based
#  features for the standard tests, as those compilation pieces are quite
#  expensive - they should probably be regulated to something like a once-a-day
#  test.
#
#  TODO - figure out how to schedule chron based jobs as well as the per
#  commit tests below, so we can define rarer but progressively more
#  comprehensive and heaver test runs.
#
#  TODO - figure out if we can generate actual release binaries from the
#  artifacts of these builds.  When we do, we'll want to also incorporate
#  some sort of periodic cleanup so we don't burn too much storage space
#  with each build - see, for example:
#  https://poweruser.blog/storage-housekeeping-on-github-actions-e2997b5b23d1?gi=f134f9f8b336

    #  The logic below uses the approach demonstrated by Cristian Adam
    #  which takes CMake's scripting mode (-P) and passes in from stdin
    #  a script that incorporates values defined in the YAML environment.
    #
    #  Windows in particular needs the environment set up for compilation,
    #  so the script recognizes when it is in that environment and
    #  operates accordingly.
