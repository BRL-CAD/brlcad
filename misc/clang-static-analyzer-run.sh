# Note: we set these variables to tell the ccc-analyzer script which compilers
# to use, but it is not always enough - when some of the sub-builds are
# triggered, they do not seem to inherit these settings and revert to the
# default compiler.  The only way so far to avoid this issue reliably seems to
# be to edit the ccc-analyzer script to use the compiler we want as the default
# compiler.
