Rules:
=====

+ Provide a version-controlled list of all bin programs to be
  processed for the "auto-man" documentation feature:

    auto-man-progs.txt

+ In the auto-man list each bin program name will be listed followed
  on the same line by the source file which provides it, e.g.,

    burst    ./src/burst/burst.c

+ Each bin source file should have one instance each of the following
  (missing strings are an error; other missing parts will be warned
  about and generated with an appropropriate FIXME statement):

  const char purpose[]   = "list directory contents"; /* brief!! */
  const char usage[]     = "....";
  const char optstring[] = ""; /* mandatory for use with bu_getopt if it is used */

+ Each option must be described in its own comment section in one of
  three possible formats:

  /* opt: -c [N] description of this option and its optional arg N */
  /* opt: -a <Z> description of this option and its mandatory arg Z */
  /* opt: -d  description of this option which has no args */

+ The following is desired but not mandatory (a missing one will
  result in a FIXME DESCRIPTION section):

  /* description:

  ... one or more paras which will got in the DESCRIPTION section...

  ... paras are separated by one or more blank lines

  ... DocBook code may be used here...

  */

+ Optional:

  /* see_also:

  ...list of man pages (with sections) or other references,
  semicolon-separated, no other embellishments...

  ...list will go in the SEE ALSO section...

  */

+ An optional beginning copyright year section (default is 1984:

  /* copyright: 2000 */

+ User-defined sections may use the same format as the 'description:'
  block but substituting the desired section name, e.g.,
  'signal_handling:'.  The section name will be translated into upper
  case and underscores into spaces in the man page.

+ All the portions using C-style comments may use valid DocBook code.
  Embedded asterisks surrounded by white space are ignored (to allow
  for the decorated comment style).  Paragraphs are indicated by one
  or more blank lines.

Translation:
===========

+ The purpose string will be used in the NAME section, e.g.:

NAME
       ls - list directory contents

+ The usage string will be used for the SYNOPSIS section.  For
  example:

    const char usage[] = "\
Usage: fbserv port_num\n\
	  (for a stand-alone daemon)\n\
   or  fbserv [-v] [-{sS} squaresize]\n\
	  [-{wW} width] [-{nN} height] -p port_num -F frame_buffer\n\
	  (for a single-frame-buffer server)\n\
          (can omit -p and -F, in which case port_num and frame_buffer\n\
           must appear in that order)\n\
";

  (Such a case may have to be specially handled for ease of parsing.)

Processing:
==========

A Perl program (version controlled) will be used to parse the source
files (defined in the file 'auto-man-progs.txt') and, after successful
parsing, a complete docbook file in man format is written to file
"progname.xml" in directory:

  ./doc/docbook/system/man1/en/

Assumptions:
===========

+ Only plain C-style comments may be used for extracting man
  information (i.e., only a leading '/*' with one or more white spaces
  following it).

+ C++-style comments are ignored unless they are inside a C-style
  comment in which case they are treated as ordinary text.

+ No more than one C-style comment or partial comment is allowed per
  line.
