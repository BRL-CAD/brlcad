This directory holds the subset of the yori CMD replacement
shell needed to build yedit.exe (https://github.com/malxau/yori)

yedit.exe is a replacement for the old edit.exe that was removed
from newer Windows versions.  It's purpose here is to act as a
last-resort text editor for BRL-CAD in Windows console mode when
nothing else is available.  (By default, Windows - as of 2024 -
doesn't supply a console mode editor.)
