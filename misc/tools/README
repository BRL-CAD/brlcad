BRL-CAD maintains and uses a number of external libraries and tools critical
to its functionality that are not installed with the distribution. Generally
these are used either in various stages of the compilation process or as
maintenance tools.

TODO - add CMake 3.30.2 and set up a bootstrap of it if a CMake older than
our desired minimum is found.

Ideally we should be able to bootstrap and continue configuring - that will (I
think) require our bootstrapping code to do its thing, and then clear all of
the build directory except for the compiled cmake and re-execute the original
CMake configure line with the same arguments as those used to launch the
original CMake.  Need to see if we have the arguments available to re-launch.
Alternately, we could simply exit and instruct the user to re-configure with
the new CMake.
