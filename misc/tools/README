BRL-CAD maintains and uses a number of external libraries and tools critical
to its functionality that are not installed with the distribution. Generally
these are used either in various stages of the compilation process or as
maintenance tools.

TODO - add latest CMake release and set up a bootstrap of it if a CMake older
than our desired minimum is found.
