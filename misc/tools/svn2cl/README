INTRODUCTION
============

svn2cl is a simple xsl transformation and shell script wrapper for generating
a classic GNU-style ChangeLog from a subversion repository log. It is made
from several changelog-like scripts using common xslt constructs found in
different places.

I made it because it was the only thing that I missed from cvs after I
converted a repository to subversion. I used cvs2cl before.

INSTALLING SVN2CL
=================

Just unpack the tarball in some directory (e.g. /opt/svn2cl-0.14)
and symlink the svn2cl.sh script in your path somewhere (e.g.
ln -s /opt/svn2cl-0.14/svn2cl.sh /usr/local/bin/svn2cl).

Note: Be sure to keep the svn2cl.xsl file in the same directory as the
svn2cl.sh script as the script looks for it there (symlinking is ok).

USING SVN2CL IN AN ANT TARGET
=============================

It is possible to use svn2cl in an ant target with a snippet like:

<tempfile property="info.xml.file"
          prefix="info-" suffix=".xml"
          destdir="${java.io.tmpdir}" />
<java classname="org.tmatesoft.svn.cli.SVN" dir="${basedir}"
      fork="true" output="${info.xml.file}"
      classpathref="javasvn-classpath">
 <arg line="log --xml --verbose" />
</java>
<xslt in="${info.xml.file}" out="ChangeLog" style="svn2cl.xsl">
 <param name="strip-prefix" expression="trunk/myProject/" />
 <param name="groupbyday" expression="yes" />
 <param name="separate-daylogs" expression="yes" />
 <param name="include-rev" expression="yes" />
 <param name="breakbeforemsg" expression="yes" />
 <param name="reparagraph" expression="yes" />
</xslt>
<delete file="${info.xml.file}" />

Although it seems that currently the xslt processor that is used by ant
inserts newlines in places it shouldn't. This can be worked around by
replacing &newl; throughout the xsl files by &#xa;.

WINDOWS PORT
============

A VBScript port of the wrapper shell script has been made by Iwasa Kazmi,
which allows running svn2cl on Microsoft Windows without a POSIX compatibility
layer and xsltproc. More information is available here:
http://www.cosmo-system.jp/iwasa/svn2clwin.html

NOTES
=====

The log is performed on the current directory '.' unless you specify URL
and/or PATH parameters. Before generating the ChangeLog you may want to make
your working copy up to date with 'svn update' (non-recursive update will do)
or pass --revision HEAD:1 as a parameter to svn2cl.sh.

There will not be very frequent new releases but if there are they can be
found at: http://arthurdejong.org/svn2cl/
