# This file provides a CHECK_C_INLINE macro that detects what keyword,
# if any, is used for inlining C functions.  This check is similar to
# autoconf's AC_C_INLINE macro.  The macro tests the inline keyword
# (c99), then __inline__ (c89), and then __inline.  When it finds one
# that works, it will cache it to HAVE_INLINE and return it in the
# provided RESULT variable.  If none work, it will set HAVE_INLINE and
# RESULT to an empty string.  Individual tests are also stored in the
# cache as HAVE_${INLINE}_KEYWORD variables.
#
# Common usage:
#
# CHECK_C_INLINE(C_INLINE)
# if(NOT C_INLINE STREQUAL "inline")
#   add_definitions("-Dinline=${C_INLINE}")
# endif(NOT C_INLINE STREQUAL "inline")
#
# This implementation was developed for BRL-CAD, initially motivated
# by a snippet from Jack Kelly on the CMake mailing list in Sep 2007,
# and further inspired by GNU Autoconf's c.m4.
