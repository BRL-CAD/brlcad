# Multiconfig on Windows with bext is a major problem.  Using Debug and Release
# DLLs together is hard:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74857726/using-a-release-configured-dll-in-another-project-that-is-configured-for-debuggi
# and early experiments indicate BRL-CAD (and/or its dependencies) are not
# able to work mixing a Release bext with a Debug BRL-CAD build or vice versa.
#
# The options are basically:
# 1.  Have the CMake logic manage both debug and release configurations of
# bext, and try to handle only including and copying the configuration we need
# at runtime somehow.  Slow, complex, error prone, crazy high space
# requirements, hard to maintain...
#
# 2.  Disable multiconfig altogether - reduce the available build
# configurations displayed in Visual Studio to one, based on a CMake setting.
# We already reduce the types to Release and Debug to make Visual Studio match
# our other build configs, so the mechanism to do this does already exist.  The
# below logic can then build the one correct bext output type, and bundling
# becomes simple.  When an external bext_output is used, it will be the user's
# responsibility to make sure the supplied bext is of a type compatible with
# their selected build configuration.
#
# At the moment we're opting for #2 - forcing CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES to be
# set to a single value and matching a value supplied to CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE (or
# defaulting to Debug if no such setting is supplied.)  Essentially, this
# forces multiconfig build tools to work more like a basic make/ninja build,
# requiring a full configure pass to change build configs.  Users would be
# responsible for pointing the build to a bext_output with the correct build
# config for their proposed build type, if they're not going to have configure
# set things up for them.
#
# The constraints we're faced with when it comes to bext are:
#
# 1.  We need the build outputs of bext in place during the configure process
#     for find_package to detect - that would mean always building *both*
#     configurations if we have a multiconfig build tool.
# 2.  The bext contents must be copied to the correct runtime locations during
#     the configure process to stage them for potential use when executables
#     are run during the build process itself - adding configuration awareness
#     to that process would significantly increase the complexity.
# 3.  It's not clear how to get CMake's package detection to support finding
#     multiple configuration copies of library outputs - some packages have
#     at least some support for detecting multiple configs, but many do not.
# 4.  We would need configuration aware install rules for all the bext output.
# 5.  For the case where we don't have a pre-existing bext_output available
#     and BRL-CAD's configure process needs to do the full setup, we don't
#     want to have to compile all possible Windows build configurations of
#     bext during configure time.  In terms of time, space, and management
#     complexity that's asking for trouble.  A Debug build of BRL-CAD would
#     not want to waste time building both Debug and Release versions of bext
#     to have available, and we can't build bext at run time because the
#     BRL-CAD configure needs the build outputs of the bext compile to work.
#
# Bottom line - because a huge amount of significant work now has to be
# finished *before* the BRL-CAD configure is complete, we can't afford to defer
# the build type decision to build time anymore.
