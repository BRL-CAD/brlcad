# By default, find_package stores values in the Cache to avoid having
# to search for the same thing multiple times.  Normally this is
# useful to make repeated configure passes faster, but in BRL-CAD's
# case we want to check system vs. local every time in case there has
# been a change (i.e. a user has added a bundled copy of a library
# that was previously being found on the system.)
#
# To do this generically, without having to be aware of what values
# each find_package call is setting, we utilize the CACHE_VARIABLES
# directory property to do a before and after detection of what
# was changed.
#
# Note that this must be a macro, since we do want find_package's
# results to be set in scope the same way they would be for a raw
# find_package call.
