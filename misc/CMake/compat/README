This directory contains various header files that are used make code
C89 compliant.  Typically, files from this directory are used to
provide a function declaration to compile BRL-CAD when a system
doesn't know about the functions which are normally hidden for C89.
When the whole world becomes POSIX- compliant this directory should be
unnecessary.
