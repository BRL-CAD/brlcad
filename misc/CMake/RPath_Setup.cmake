# the build directory AND install directory.  Thanks to plplot for
# identifying the necessity of setting CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR on OSX.

# http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_RPATH_handling

# use, i.e. don't skip the full RPATH for the build tree
set(CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH FALSE)

# when building, don't use the install RPATH already
# (but later on when installing)
set(CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH FALSE)

# the RPATH/INSTALL_NAME_DIR to be used when installing
if (NOT APPLE)

# On OSX, we need to set INSTALL_NAME_DIR instead of RPATH for CMake < 3.0
