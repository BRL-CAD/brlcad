# - Find re2c executable

# The module defines the following variables:
#  RE2C_FOUND - true is re2c executable is found
#  RE2C_EXECUTABLE - the path to the re2c executable
#
#  ====================================================================
#  Example:
#
#   find_package(LEMON)
#   find_package(RE2C)
#
#   LEMON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp
#   RE2C_TARGET(MyScanner scanner.re  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BIANRY_DIR}/scanner.cpp)
#   ADD_RE2C_LEMON_DEPENDENCY(MyScanner MyParser)
#
#   include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR})
#   add_executable(Foo
#      Foo.cc
#      ${LEMON_MyParser_OUTPUTS}
