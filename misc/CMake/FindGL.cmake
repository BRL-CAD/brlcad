# - Try to find OpenGL
# Once done this will define
#
#  OPENGL_FOUND            - system has OpenGL
#  OPENGL_XMESA_FOUND      - system has XMESA
#  OPENGL_GLU_FOUND        - system has GLU
#  OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR_GL   - the GL include directory
#  OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR_GLX  - the GLX include directory
#  OPENGL_LIBRARIES        - Link these to use OpenGL and GLU
#
# If you want to use just GL you can use these values
#  OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY   - Path to OpenGL Library
#  OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY  - Path to GLU Library
#
# Define controlling option OPENGL_USE_AQUA if on Apple -
# if this is not true, look for the X11 OpenGL.  Defaults
# to true.
