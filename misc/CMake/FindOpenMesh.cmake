#
# Try to find OPENMESH
# Once done this will define
#  
# OPENMESH_FOUND           - system has OPENMESH
# OPENMESH_INCLUDE_DIRS    - the OPENMESH include directories
# OPENMESH_LIBRARIES       - Link these to use OPENMESH
###
# - helpful cmake flags when building
#
#  OPENMESH_ROOT          - path to OpenMesh root if it is built outside of the usual location
