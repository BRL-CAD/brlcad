#
# Unlike most CMake based projects, BRL-CAD's current build system works like
# its AutoTools-based precursor and tracks all files present in the source
# tree.  Additionally, it also defines a "distclean" target that is intended to
# "scrub" the tree down to either a vanilla source tree (when doing an
# in-src-dir build) or an empty directory (when doing the more traditional
# compile-in-build-directory process.  (CMake's traditional 'clean' targets do
# not remove all outputs of any sort - custom command outputs and CMake's own
# files are left behind using those targets alone.)
#
# In order to support this process, we define functions that allow the build to
# identify both files that are part of the expected BRL-CAD build tree, and
# expected build outputs that need to be removed.  Note that build outputs that
# the standard "clean" targets remove should not be listed - those are already
# handled by the standard CMake build process and the output names are
# frequently platform specific.  The "distclean" function should only be used
# to identify files a "make clean" pass would leave behind.
#
# BRL-CAD's exec and lib build targets will handle listing non-generated source
# files specified for those targets as BRL-CAD files, so it is not necessary to
# use the raw "CMAKEFILES" function to list those inputs (unless such files
# may be turned on or off for compilation by feature flags - in that case, the
# files which may be disabled should also be listed in a "CMAKEFILES" list)
#
# For performance reasons, CMake global variables are used to build up the
# various file lists rather than writing them to disk each time an addition
# is made.  Other build logic then retrieves the lists and writes them to
# disk to make them available for processing with build targets such as
# distclean and package_source

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# We need a way to tell whether one path is a subpath of another path without
# relying on regular expressions, since file paths may have characters in them
# that will trigger regex matching behavior when we don't want it.  (To test,
# for example, use a build directory name of build++)
#
# Sets ${result_var} to 1 if the candidate subpath is actually a subpath of
# the supplied "full" path, otherwise sets it to 0.
#
# The routine below does the check without using regex matching, in order to
# handle path names that contain characters that would be interpreted as active
# in a regex string.

# Distcheck needs to know what files are "supposed" to be present in order to

#
# For this set of functions to work correctly, it is important that any call
# (via target definitions or via explicit calls to CMAKEFILES) supply relative
# paths for files present in the source tree.  Generated files fed into
# compilation targets are not one of the things that should be in lists
# generated by this function, and the only way to reliably recognize them is to
# reject files specified using their full path.  Such files must use their full
# path in the build logic in order for out-of-src-dir builds to function, so as
# long as no full paths are used for files actually IN the source tree this
# method is reliable.  The filtering logic will try to catch improperly
# specified files, but if the build directory and the source directory are one
# and the same this will not be possible.
