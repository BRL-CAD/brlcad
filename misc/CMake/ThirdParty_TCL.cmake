###

# The question of whether and when to build Tcl/Tk extensions is among
# the most complex issues in BRL-CAD's build logic.  In order of priority,
# these are the factors considered when evaluating whether to compile
# a Tcl/Tk extension:
#
# 1.  Are the variables listed in required_vars enabled?  If one or more
#     of them is not, there is never any point in building or searching for
#     packages requiring those variables. Examples of variables used here
#     include BRLCAD_ENABLE_TK and BRLCAD_ENABLE_OPENGL.  If the BRLCAD_<PKG>
#     variable is set to SYSTEM, the only impact this will have if triggered
#     is to disable the execution of the system test.
# 2.  Is the extension variable set to SYSTEM explicitly?  If so, the
#     extension will not be built under any circumstances.  Whether it
#     is tested for depends on condition 1 above.  If it is tested for and
#     not detected (e.g. BRL-CAD's Tk features are enabled and Tkhtml
#     is not found) a BRLCAD_<PKG>_NOTFOUND variable will be set, but
#     the extension will not be enabled.
# 3.  Is the extension variable set to BUNDLED explicitly?  If so, only
#     a disabled required_vars variable will disable it, and only then if
#     the extension requires that variable.
# 4.  If BRLCAD_TCL has been set explicitly to SYSTEM (not automatically
#     as a consequence of detecting it in an AUTO search) Tcl/Tk
#     extensions will also need to be SYSTEM unless explicitly enabled
#     by their own BRLCAD_<PKG> variable (condition 3 above).  If not
#     found, BRLCAD_<PKG>_NOTFOUND will also be set in this instance.
# 5.  If BRLCAD_TCL has been automatically set to SYSTEM as a consequence
#     of BRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS being set to SYSTEM, the situation is
#     regarded as identical to condition 4 above. If not found,
#     BRLCAD_<PKG>_NOTFOUND will also be set in this instance.
# 6.  If BRLCAD_TCL_BUILD is ON (either because BRLCAD_TCL is set to
#     BUNDLED explicitly, because it has been set to BUNDLED (Auto) due
#     to BRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS being set to BUNDLED, or because the AUTO
#     search failed to find an acceptable Tcl on the system) Tcl/Tk
#     extensions also default to ON, subject to the above conditions.
#     If the extension has been forced to OFF for any reason other than
#     a feature-based disabling and BRLCAD_TCL is hard-set to
#     bundled (or BRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS is set to BUNDLED and BRLCAD_TCL
#     is not hard-set to SYSTEM) CMake will FATAL_ERROR - using a system
#     package when we're NOT using a system Tcl/Tk is probably not
#     workable - even if it somehow compiled and ran, the probability
#     of subtle issues would be high.
# 7.  If none of the above conditions preclude the usefulness of doing
#     so, test the available Tcl/Tk to see if it supplies the package
#     in question.  If NEEDS_LIBS is populated, the Tcl/Tk "package require"
#     mechanism is not enough and a system version of the package must
#     also have locatable C libraries  If a system version is found that
#     satisfies all criteria, compilation of the extension is disabled -
#
#     Note:  For the time being, this routine does not attempt to address
#     the problem of header identification.  In principle it should do so,
#     but the current reality is that oftentimes "private" headers will be
#     needed by BRL-CAD when using Tcl/Tk extensions - these headers may
#     not be installed on system versions of packages, or may be in
#     non-standard places if they are.  In those situations, if the system
#     version of the Tcl/Tk package in question is compatible with the
#     copy in src/other (usually the case, since BRL-CAD requires a fairly
#     modern Tcl/Tk to work), the build can use the system package with
#     the *local* copy of the package's private headers, even when building
#     with system extensions.  This is sub-optimal, and eventually logic
#     should be added to
