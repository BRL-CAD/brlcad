Uses the svn2git code from:  https://www.gitorious.org/svn2git

rsync -av svn.code.sf.net::p/brlcad/code .

./svn2git/svn-all-fast-export --add-metadata --identity-map account-map --rules rules code


For tags, if you've used the supplied rules file, follow this post's approach:
http://blog.smartbear.com/software-quality/migrating-from-subversion-to-git-lessons-learned/

git branch |
# Remove spaces at beginning of line:
sed s/..// |
# Only get 'tag' branches:
grep ^tag-- |
# Strip down to just the tag name:
sed s/tag--// |
while read tagname; do
  git tag -a "$tagname" -m "Tag imported from SVN." "tag--$tagname" >/dev/null 2>/dev/null && echo "tagged: $tagname"
  git branch -D "tag--$tagname" >/dev/null 2>/dev/null && echo "deleted branch: tag--$tagname"
done

Most of the time the rules and account-map file in this directory are the ones
you want to use - if they are out of date or need tweaking, a helpful resource
is Jeff Geerling's page:

Also, should probably check out this approach for archiving inactive branches, since we don't
really want to completely delete them:

A *really* ambituous goal would be to have all the src/other projects be their own
git projects and have them use whatever the proper git sub-project inclusion mechanism
is.  We've extracted the utahrle work, so it is possible to do at least the first part
(albeit a lot of work) but the second bit is unclear.


Other misc items that fell out of this effort:

To get the complete log of BRL-CAD's entire svn history and convert it to csv
format for processing/filtering, use the rsync'd copy of the repo and the
svnlog2csv python script in this directory:

svn log --xml file:///home/user/brlcad-svn_repo/code > brlcad_full_log.xml
svnlog2csv > brlcad_full_log.csv
