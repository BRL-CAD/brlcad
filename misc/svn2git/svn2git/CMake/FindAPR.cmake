# - Try to find APR
#
# From https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/pki.git/plain/cmake/Modules/FindAPR.cmake
#
# Once done this will define
#
#  APR_FOUND - system has APR
#  APR_INCLUDE_DIRS - the APR include directory
#  APR_LIBRARIES - Link these to use APR
#  APR_DEFINITIONS - Compiler switches required for using APR
