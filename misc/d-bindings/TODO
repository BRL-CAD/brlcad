C grammar parser
================

Make a C grammar parser that creates a Perl class hierarchy to
interpret and instantiate the C syntax tree (derived with P::RD):

  CC/
   CC.pm # base class

Decide how the D interface system fits into the build system
============================================================

1.  We need to know some system characteristics to properly create
    modules.

2.  Is completely-automatic generation of interface modules possible?

3.  What is the status of D standard modules vs. the C library?

Proposed layout in the build directory
======================================
  # all public api (for headers found in installed dir
  # "$BRLCAD_ROOT/include/brlcad" and its sub-dirs)
  ./di/X.d       # module: brlcad.X (includes all X/* headers)
  ...

  # other brlcad-specific, private installed headers

  # "$BRLCAD_ROOT/include"
  ./di/other/X.d  # module: brlcad.other.X
  ...

  # for subdirs
  # "$BRLCAD_ROOT/include/X"
  ./di/X/Y.d      # module: brlcad.X.Y
  ...

  # for external headers found, we attempt to generate F files for
  # them and put them in a separate sub-dir
  ./di/external/X.d      # module: brlcad.external.X
  ./di/external/X/Y.d    # module: brlcad.external.X.Y
  ...

Note that for eventual installation the contents of directory "./di"
will be recursively installed to:

   $BRLCAD_ROOT/d

Current librt dependencies
==========================

To be successful, the BRL-CAD core library librt must be available,
and its current, external dependencies on my system are (from ldd):

  linux-vdso.so.1
  libz.so.1
  libdl.so.2
  libpthread.so.0
  libm.so.6
  libstdc++.so.6
  libgcc_s.so.1
  libc.so.6
  /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

libbu and its external dependencies are only one less:

  linux-vdso.so.1
  libpthread.so.0
  libdl.so.2
  libm.so.6
  libstdc++.so.6
  libgcc_s.so.1
  libc.so.6
  /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
