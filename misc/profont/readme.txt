WHAT IS THIS?

This is ProFont TrueType, converted to Windows TrueType format
by Mike Smith, with some tweaks added by "ardu".

Modifications include:
- A Euro character
- Missing characters from the Latin 1 code page
- Full support for CodePage 850. These are mostly the famous
  block/box characters you know from DOS. Very useful if you use
  Mightnight Commander through PuTTY.
- Fixed metrics so that point size of 9 works correctly. Until now
  you had to select 7 to obtain the native point size of 9.
- Added some quick&dirty hinting for point size of 9. Most characters
  now match closely the look of the bitmap version.
  Don't expect it to look good on anything else than Windows...
