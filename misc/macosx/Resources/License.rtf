\f2\b \ul Overview\
\pard\tx1440\tx2880\tx4320\tx5760\tx7200\ql\qnatural

\f1\b0 \cf0 \ulnone BRL-CAD consists primarily of libraries, applications, scripts, documentation, geometric models, images, and build infrastructure. The BRL-CAD libraries include the headers in the include/ directory as well as all of the directories that begin with the prefix "lib" in the src/ directory (e.g. src/librt/).  All of BRL-CAD's applications and libraries are covered by the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) as published by the Free Software Foundation unless noted otherwise in the source files.\
\
Most of BRL-CAD's build infrastructure (i.e. files required by the GNU Build System such as the configure.ac and all Makefile.am files), a variety of scripts located in the misc/ and sh/ directories, and the testing infrastructure (scripts and resources) are provided either under the BSD license or are in the public domain.  Refer to each individual file for specific terms.\
\
BRL-CAD's documentation consists of manual pages located throughout the package, most of the files in the doc/ directory, and the top-level administrative project text files (e.g. README & AUTHORS).  Unless otherwise denoted, all of BRL-CAD's documentation is made available under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) or, at your option, under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 as published by the Free Software Foundation.  Several older documents (e.g. published by the U.S. Government prior to being released as Open Source) are in the public domain.  Refer to each document and the original author(s) individually for specific terms.\
\
Unless previously described or otherwise already covered by another license, the BRL-CAD package is covered under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 as published by the Free Software Foundation.  This includes but is not limited to the applications, geometric models, images, and other resource data included in the BRL-CAD distribution.\
\
The full text of the GPL, LGPL, GFDL, and BSD license should be included in the source distribution of BRL-CAD in the doc/legal/ directory.  Refer to the full license text for more details, information, and implications of each license.\
