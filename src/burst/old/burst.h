 * MUVES "Hm" (hierarchical menu) package definitions
 *
 * This software and documentation is derived in part from the
 * menuhit(9.3) manual pages (not source code) in AT&T 9th Edition
 * UNIX, Version 1 Programmer's Manual.
 *
 * The Hm package provides a pop-up menu implementation which uses a
 * terminal-independent screen management facility (Sc package) to
 * simulate the necessary graphics using the ASCII character set.
 * Only a few keyboard characters are required to control the menus,
 * but when possible, as with DMD terminals running a MYX terminal
 * emulator, the menus can be controlled with the mouse.
 */
/**
 * Each menu is defined by the following structure:
 *
 * typedef struct {
 * HmItem *item;
 * HmItem *(*generator)();
 * short prevtop;
 * short prevhit;
 * int sticky;
 * }
 * HmMenu;
 *
 * A menu can be built as an array of HmItem's, pointed to by item, or
 * with a generator function.  If item is (HmItem *) 0, the generator
 * field is assumed to be valid.  The generator function is passed an
 * integer parameter, and must return the pointer to an HmItem in a
 * static area (the result is only needed until the next call).  The
 * n's are guaranteed to start at 0 and increase by 1 each invocation
 * until generator returns (HmItem *) 0.  Prevtop will contain the
 * index of the menu item which appeared at the top of the menu the
 * last time it was displayed.  Prevhit will contain the index of the
 * last item traversed (indices begin at 0).  If sticky is true, the
 * menu will hang around after an entry is selected so that another
 * entry may be chosen and the menu must be exited explicitly with the
 * appropriate key-stroke or equivalent mouse operation.  Otherwise,
 * the menu will exit after selection of an item (and any actions
 * resulting from that selection such as submenus have finished).
 * WARNING: if a menu is to be used more than once during recursive
 * calls to HmHit, there needs to be distinct copies (allocated
 * storage) since the item field is filled in by the generator
 * function, and the prevtop and prevhit fields should be private to
 * the current invocation of HmHit.

 * Characters with the 0200 bit set are regarded as fill characters.
 * For example, the string "\240X" will appear in the menu as a
 * right-justified X (040 is the ASCII space character).  Menu strings
 * without fill characters are drawn centered in the menu.  Whether
 * generated statically or dynamically, the list of HmItem's must be
 * terminated by a NULL text field.  The help string will be displayed
 * when the user presses the help key.  If next is not equal to
 * (HmMenu *) 0, it is assumed to point to a submenu, "dfn()" if
 * non-zero is called just before the submenu is invoked, and "bfn()"
 * likewise just afterwards.  These functions are passed the current
 * menu item.  If the menu item is selected and next is 0, "hfn()" is

/**
 * HmItem *HmHit(HmMenu *menup)
 *
 * HmHit() presents the user with a menu specified by HmMenu pointer
 * menup and returns a pointer to the selected HmItem or 0 if nothing
 * was selected.  The menu is presented to the user with the item
 * corresponding to prevhit (current item) highlighted.  If a menu has
 * not been accessed yet, prevhit will be set to the first item.  The
 * user may move the cursor to the item below the current one by
 * pressing the 'd' key, or move up by pressing the 'u'.  If the user
 * presses 'h', the help message for the current item will be
 * displayed until another key is struck.  To select an item, the user
 * presses the space bar.  An actual selection has been made when the
 * selected item does not have a submenu, otherwise, it may be termed
 * a traversal of that item.  Traversing an item does change the value
 * of prevhit, but is not final as the submenu can be exited by the
 * user pressing 'q', before selecting an item.  In case the screen
 * becomes disturbed (i.e. by the output of another process), holding
 * down the CONTROL key and striking an 'l' will re-display all of the
 * menus.
 *
 * Both the help and warning (non-fatal error) messages will be
 * displayed in the one-line window at HmYCOMMO.  For instance, if the
 * user hits any keys other than the ones mentioned above, an error
 * message will appear in this window.  Also, a one-line window is
 * reserved for application prompts at HmYPROMPT.  The prompt window
 * is cleared just prior to blocking on user input, and the message
 * window is cleared when the user provides input (strikes a key).
 *
 * If a menu has more items than can be displayed at once, the corners
 * of the menu will indicate this as follows:
 *
 * '+' means the adjacent displayed item is the actual first (or last
 * if a bottom corner) item in the menu.
 *
 * 'v' means that the entry displayed in the previous line is not the
 * last, and the menu can be scrolled upwards.
 *
 * '^' means that the entry displayed on the next line is not actually
 * the first, and the menu can be scrolled downwards.
 *
 * Attempting to move the cursor below the bottom entry of the menu
 * will cause the menu to scroll half a page or until the entries run
 * out, which ever comes first.  If there are no entries to scroll the
 * terminal will beep.  The analogous holds true for attempting to
 * move upward past the top entry of the menu.  If a DMD terminal with
 * MYX running is used, a special cursor will appear, and the user may
 * use the mouse rather than the keyboard as follows: Clicking button
 * 1 of the mouse while the cursor is outside the "current menu", will
 * cause the terminal to beep.  If the cursor is on an item, that item
 * will be made "current".  If on the "current" item, that item will
 * be selected.  If on the top border of the current menu, that menu
 * will scroll down if possible, and if not, that menu will exit.  If
 * on the bottom border, that menu will scroll upward if possible and
 * beep if not.
