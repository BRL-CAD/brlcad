/**

This software and documentation is derived in part from the
menuhit(9.3) manual pages (not source code) in AT&T 9th Edition
UNIX, Version 1 Programmer's Manual.

The Hm package provides a pop-up menu implementation which uses
a terminal-independent screen management facility (Sc package)
to simulate the necessary graphics using the ASCII character set.
Only a few keyboard characters are required to control the menus,
but when possible, as with DMD terminals running a MYX terminal
emulator, the menus can be controlled with the mouse.

**/
/**
   Each menu is defined by the following structure:

   typedef struct {
   HmItem *item;
   HmItem *(*generator)();
   short prevtop;
   short prevhit;
   int sticky;
   }
   HmMenu;

   A menu can be built as an array of HmItem's, pointed to by item,
   or with a generator function.  If item is (HmItem *) 0, the
   generator field is assumed to be valid.  The generator function
   is passed an integer parameter, and must return the pointer to
   an HmItem in a static area (the result is only needed until the
   next call).  The n's are guaranteed to start at 0 and increase
   by 1 each invocation until generator returns (HmItem *) 0.
   Prevtop will contain the index of the menu item which appeared
   at the top of the menu the last time it was displayed.  Prevhit
   will contain the index of the last item traversed (indices begin
   at 0).  If sticky is true, the menu will hang around after an
   entry is selected so that another entry may be chosen and the
   menu must be exited explicitly with the appropriate key-stroke
   or equivalent mouse operation.  Otherwise, the menu will exit
   after selection of an item (and any actions resulting from that
   selection such as submenus have finished).  WARNING: if a menu
   is to be used more than once during recursive calls to HmHit,
   there needs to be distinct copies (allocated storage) since the
   item field is filled in by the generator function, and the
   prevtop and prevhit fields should be private to the current
   invocation of HmHit.

**/

struct HmMenu;

typedef struct
{
    char *text;			/* menu item string */
    char *help;			/* help string */
    struct HmMenu *next;	/* sub-menu pointer or NULL */
    void (*dfn)();
    void (*bfn)();
    void (*hfn)();
    long data;

HmItem;

/**
   Menu items are defined by the following structure:

   typedef struct {
   char *text;
   char *help;
   HmMenu *next;
   void (*dfn)();
   void (*bfn)();
   void (*hfn)();
   long data;
   }
   HmItem;

   The text field will be displayed as the name of the item.
   Characters with the 0200 bit set are regarded as fill characters.
   For example, the string "\240X" will appear in the menu as a
   right-justified X (040 is the ASCII space character).  Menu
   strings without fill characters are drawn centered in the menu.
   Whether generated statically or dynamically, the list of HmItem's
   must be terminated by a NULL text field.  The help string will be
   displayed when the user presses the help key.  If next is not
   equal to (HmMenu *) 0, it is assumed to point to a submenu,
   "dfn()" if non-zero is called just before the submenu is invoked,
   and "bfn()" likewise just afterwards.  These functions are passed
   the current menu item.  If the menu item is selected and next is
   0, "hfn()" is called (if non-zero), also with the current menu
   item.  The "data" field is reserved for the user to pass
   information between these functions and the calling routine.

int HmInit(int x, int y, int maxvis)

HmInit() must be called before any other routines in the
Hm package to initialize the screen position of the top-left
corner of the top-level menu to x and y and to set the
maximum number of menu entries which will be visable at one
time to maxvis.  If the number of entries in a menu exceeds
maxvis, the menu will scroll to accommodate them.  The values
of x, y and maxvis are stored in these external variables:

int HmLftMenu
int HmTopMenu
int HmMaxVis

If this routine is not called, default parameters will be used.

HmInit() also opens "/dev/tty" for input and stores it's file
descriptor in HmTtyFd and associated stream handle in HmTtyFp.

int HmTtyFd
FILE *HmTtyFp

This routine returns true or false on success or failure to open
"/dev/tty".

/**

HmItem *HmHit(HmMenu *menup)

HmHit() presents the user with a menu specified by HmMenu
pointer menup and returns a pointer to the selected HmItem
or 0 if nothing was selected.  The menu is presented to
the user with the item corresponding to prevhit (current
item) highlighted.  If a menu has not been accessed yet,
prevhit will be set to the first item.  The user may move
the cursor to the item below the current one by pressing the
'd' key, or move up by pressing the 'u'.  If the user
presses 'h', the help message for the current item will be
displayed until another key is struck.  To select an item,
the user presses the space bar.  An actual selection has
been made when the selected item does not have a submenu,
otherwise, it may be termed a traversal of that item.
Traversing an item does change the value of prevhit, but
is not final as the submenu can be exited by the user
pressing 'q', before selecting an item.  In case the screen
becomes disturbed (i.e. by the output of another process),
holding down the <control> key and striking an 'l' will
re-display all of the menus.

Both the help and warning (non-fatal error) messages will
be displayed in the one-line window at HmYCOMMO.  For
instance, if the user hits any keys other than the ones
mentioned above, an error message will appear in this
window.  Also, a one-line window is reserved for application
prompts at HmYPROMPT.  The prompt window is cleared just
prior to blocking on user input, and the message window
is cleared when the user provides input (strikes a key).

If a menu has more items than can be displayed at once,
the corners of the menu will indicate this as follows:

'+' means the adjacent displayed item is the actual first
(or last if a bottom corner) item in the menu.
'v' means that the entry displayed in the previous line
is not the last, and the menu can be scrolled upwards.
'^' means that the entry displayed on the next line is
not actually the first, and the menu can be scrolled
downwards.

Attempting to move the cursor below the bottom entry of
the menu will cause the menu to scroll half a page or
until the entries run out, which ever comes first.  If
there are no entries to scroll the terminal will beep.
The analagous holds true for attempting to move upward
past the top entry of the menu.  If a DMD terminal with
MYX running is used, a special cursor will appear, and
the user may use the mouse rather than the keyboard as
follows:  Clicking button 1 of the mouse while the
cursor is outside the "current menu", will cause the
terminal to beep.  If the cursor is on an item, that item
will be made "current".  If on the "current" item, that
item will be selected.  If on the top border of the
current menu, that menu will scroll down if possible, and
if not, that menu will exit.  If on the bottom border,
that menu will scroll upward if possible and beep if not.

back on the input stream.  They may be both be supplied by
the application if the default behavior is not desirable.
HmGetchar() returns the next character on the standard input.
This command will block until input is available.
HmUngetchar() inserts the character c on the standard input.
An EOF will be returned if this is not possible or c is
equal to EOF.  In general, this is guaranteed to work for one
character assuming that something has already been read with
HmGetchar() and the input stream is buffered.

   which are called from HmHit(), but are provided in case an
   escape from the program is provided by the application or job
   control is enabled in the underlying shell, in which case,
   these routines can be called from a menu function or signal
