Contained in this directory are codes that are written to work with and/or link
against external packages.  These codes are often written as plugins, modules,
or libraries to to some external package and will not be built as working
binaries in the standard BRL-CAD build.  They *are* built, but only to ensure
that they remain current with BRL-CAD's own APIs.  See specific notes below for
about what is required to build working versions.

Contents
--------

Cubit
	This code is a CUBIT translator that will read a given BRL-CAD geometry
file and convert the included 3D geometry to a CUBIT readable representation
(.sat).  This code utilizes the CUBIT's CGM API and must be linked against
CUBIT's CGM libraries and the ACIS CAD kernel.

Creo
	This code is a PTC Creo Parametric exporter plugin module intended to
be used directly within the Parametric environment.  Working compilation of
this code requires Pro/Toolkit, a separately licensed module from PTC.

Unigraphics
	This code is a Unigraphics (now called NX) importer that will parse a
given Unigraphics geometry file and convert the included 3D geometry to a
BRL-CAD representation.  This code utilizes the UGOPEN API and must be linked
against the UGOPEN libraries.
