This is a build of the Creo Parametric 2.0 plugin (64-bit) that exports
geometry in polygonal format for use with BRL-CAD.  The export plugin
has a variety of options, but should be relatively self-explanatory.
The build interfaces with the Pro/Toolkit plugin interface.  This build
was compiled on Windows 7.

To inform Creo Parametric 2.0 about the Pro/Toolkit code that produces a
BRL-CAD ASCII file, you need to create a "protk.dat" file as follows:

line 1:name proe-brl
line 2:startup spawn
line 3:exec_file 'full path to wherever you install proe-brl'
line 4:text_dir 'full path to the "text" directory'
line 5:revision 2001
line 6:description Export facetization of displayed model to BRL-CAD
line 7:end

The easiest thing to do is modify the "protk.dat" file found in this directory.
The exec_file must include the name of the executable file (i.e., proe-brl.dll), and
the text_dir must include the name of the "text" directory.

-------- Begin Example protk.dat --------
name proe-brl
startup dll
exec_file C:/Program Files (x86)/PTC/Creo 2.0/Common Files/M020/x86e_win64/obj/proe-brl.dll
text_dir C:/Program Files (x86)/PTC/Creo 2.0/Common Files/M020/text
revision 7.22.1
description Convert currently displayed model to BRL-CAD
end
--------  End Example protk.dat  --------

Place the edited "protk.dat" file in the following directory:
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\PTC\Creo 2.0\Common Files\M020\protoolkit".
Place the "usermsg.txt" file in the following directory:
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\PTC\Creo 2.0\Common Files\M020\text\usascii"
Place the resource files (i.e. proe_brl.res, proe_brl_error.res and
proe_brl_gen_error.res) in the following directory:
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\PTC\Creo 2.0\Common Files\M020\text\resource"
Lastly, place the plugin and associated dll's (i.e., proe-brl.dll, libbu.dll,
libbn.dll and tcl.dll) in the following directory:
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\PTC\Creo 2.0\Common Files\M020\x86e_win64\obj"

Note - the installation point may vary, depending on your installation. In the
examples above the installation point is "C:\Program Files (x86)\PTC\Creo 2.0".

To activate the plugin, do the following:
1) Start Creo Parametric.
2) On the Home tab, in the Utilities group, click Auxiliary Applications or click
   Tools > Auxiliary Applications. The Auxiliary Applications dialog box opens.
3) Click Register to register the protk.dat file. The Register auxiliary
   application dialog box opens.
4) Browse to the full path of the protk.dat file, select and click the "Open" button.
5) This adds the plugin to the "Auxiliary Applications" dialog. Select and click the
   "Start" button to load the plugin into Creo's "Tools/File" menu found in the "Tools" tab.
   If the above mentioned files are installed properly, you will see the message
   "Application "proe-brl started successfully" in the Creo Parametric 2.0 message window
   at the bottom.
6) Select Proe-BRL from this menu to launch.

After launch, you need to enter an output file name, a starting
region ident number, a maximum and minimum allowed error for the facetization
approximation, and a maximum and minimum angle control. The recommended value for the
angle control is 0.5.  Select the "Go" button at the bottom to output the
currently displayed model to a file in BRL-CAD ACSII format (actually a Tcl script).
The output file can then be converted to BRL-CAD by using "asc2g" or by sourcing the
file in MGED using the "source" command.
