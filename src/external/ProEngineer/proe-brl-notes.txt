Compiling the proe-brl.dll against prodevelop and protoolkit
libs (BTW, these are static libs) has created potential problems
when trying to deploy the proe-brl.dll to platforms that either
don't have Visual Studio or an older version. The only symptom is
that the plugin will fail to load and there will be no indication
in the Proe trail file of why it failed to load.

Digging in a bit turns up a side by side configuration error.
It turns out that Proe's static libs are compiled with an old version
of the C-runtime. So when the proe-brl.dll gets compiled it depends
on both the C-runtime of Proe's static libs and the C-runtime of the
Visual Studio used to compile the dll. In short, this causes the
plugin load to fail. As near as I can tell, there are two possible
solutions to this problem. The first is to install the latest vcredist
on the hobbled machine. The second is to create a application/dll
config file and do a binding redirect to a newer version of the
C-runtime.

Currently, the config file and the manifest file for the proe-brl.dll
is not embedded. So both files must be copied with the proe-brl.dll
to their place in the Proe hierarchy. I believe it's possible to
embed both files in the dll. I can see how to embed the manifest, but
am not sure about the config file.
