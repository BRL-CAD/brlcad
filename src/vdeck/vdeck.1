.SH NAME
vdeck \- generate COM-GEOM decks from a GED file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vdeck
.RB file .vg

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I vdeck
tool converts a model into an ASCII text representation separating
regions (combinations with the region flag set) and primitives (also
known as solids) into separate files.  A list of objects to be
converted are selected interactively from the table of contents.
String matching operators (wild cards) like those used to specify file
or directory names in
.IR sh\^ (1)
are provided for this purpose, as well as to search for names in the
table of contents.
.P
One or more COM-GEOM decks can be output.  Each deck consists of three
files: the solid, region, and region-id tables.  These can be combined
with
.IR cat\^ (1).
.P
A menu of the commands and their usage is available by typing
.B ?
to the program.

.SH WARNING
The
.I vdeck
tool is intended for v5 BRL-CAD geometry databases only.  Files
produced by older (v4 and earlier) versions of BRL-CAD may be
incompatible with
.IR vdeck\^.

.SH EXAMPLE
In the following example,
.I <model>
is the name of the BRL-CAD model and
.I <groupname>
is a group or region.  
.I Vdeck
converts all of the primitives and regions within the specified group
into text and writes them out to files:
.PP
.nf
> vdeck <model>.g 
command ( ? for menu ) >> i <goupname> 
command ( ? for menu ) >> d 
=================================================== 
O U T P U T F I L E S 
solid table = "solids" 
region table = "regions" 
region identification table = "region_ids" 
command ( ? for menu ) >> q
