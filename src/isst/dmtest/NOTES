TODO:

X 1.  embedded framebuffer (remaining TODO - use texture rather than pixel drawing...)

X 2.  output of bu_subprocess commands back to QtConsole prompt.

    Check https://github.com/juangburgos/QConsoleListener to see if it can help - we need
    something that can achieve similar results to the Tcl mechanism being used to capture
    rt output.  Also for rt in particular, check into what MGED and Archer are doing to
    get raytracing output displayed and whether that can be refactored into something
    more general.

x 2a.  See about getting rt output into dm embedded framebuffer.  Study src/mged/fbserv.c
    and src/libtclcad/fbserv.c to see if they can be generalized in some fashion.

    * At some point will want to look into QLocalServer/QLocalSocket to see if it
      can be used, but for now using the Qt Tcp connection.

x 3.  Finish accordion widget, into libqtcad (moved, behavior improved.  Open/close
      placement may need more tweaking - that's a rather tricky behavior for QSplitter -
      but it seems to be fairly close)

x 4.  Implement Qt quad view widget  (start basic - do a QGridLayout with 4 QtGL/QtSW instances.)

      More work can be done here, but basic functionality has been demonstrated.


x 5.  temporary objects (nirt shotline, rtcheck/gqa overlap visuals, gdiff output...)

    look at all libged commands using _ged_cvt_vlblock_to_solids to get a list of those that will
    need adjustment to work with the new setup.

6.  primitive editing MGED style.  Likely will need editing callbacks, probably per-primitive
    with a librt functab entry.

    Want to do this without baking editing state into libged.  Current thought is to define a
    view routine to create a transient interactive view object from the database solid that has
    a local copy of the db internal.  The edit operations and wireframe updates will be done
    using that local copy, and then a separate operation will be used to write the view object
    back to the database.  Equivalent to the sed|oed/edit/apply cycle, with the sed operation
    creating a view object (it will be a separate step to suppress the original wireframe, if
    that's what the app wants to do) edit operations being applied to the view object, and
    then apply writing the altered db internal from the view object back to the .g file.  (If
    the app suppressed the old wireframe, it will also need to restore the new version since
    applying the view obj changes and removing the view obj won't automatically draw the final
    database object.  The "reject" operation would just be removing the view object on which
    editing is being performed.

7.  color controls (background in particular) settable in MGED...

8.  Fix fps meter drawing - should either be lower left, or appended to status line if that's enabled

9.  Implement more key bindings for dm widgets.

10.  MGED faceplate GUI - needed?  Does (for example) pipe editing need it...

11.  Predictor - is it useful, or can we remove it?

12.  Qt dialogues for color setting and fonts

13. Parse and interpret .mgedrc files...

Even if we can get a Tcl/Tk free stack working fully, users will need an option
for a Tcl prompt if we are going to support .mgedrc customizations.

May be worth exploring whether we can get away with using just the minimal
bootstrap version of jimtcl's library:

https://github.com/msteveb/jimtcl

The script make-bootstrap-jim can produce a single .c file:

./make-bootstrap-jim > jimtcl0.c

This file can in turn be compiled to a shared lib in CMake with:

add_library(jimtcl0 SHARED jimtcl0.c)
target_compile_definitions(jimtcl0 PUBLIC JIM_BOOTSTRAP_LIB_ONLY)

Would need to be tested, but if it can provide a MGED-style Tcl prompt that is
sufficient for scripting purposes and loading .mgedrc files it would be a far
simpler integration than the all-up libtcl build...

If it doesn't work, look into https://www.tcl.tk/community/tcl2019/assets/talk160/Paper.pdf

14.  Man page viewer as libqtcad widget

15.  Qt .g tree hierarchy widget into libqtcad

16.  Qt palette widget - get plugin design finalized, into libqtcad

17.  Come up with a way to configure key bindings - ideally command line supported
     in a portable way via dm libged command.
     Probably bindings subcommand will use a callback function to implement changes
     that is registered by the application

18.  Raytrace control panel equivalent in Qt.

19.  Dedication dialog as Qt libqtcad widget

20.  Look over editor widgets, tools and panels to translate as Qt widgets - at least
     Combination Editor, Bot Edit, Build Pattern and Overlap tool need to be studied,
     and probably others.

21.  Figure out how to do a button bar in Qt

22.  See if we can switch the text label for a Qt dock widget to be a menu when it is
     floating...

23.  Archer help browser as a Qt widget.

24.  Translate sketch editor to Qt.

25.  Look into build scripts from https://github.com/martinrotter/qt-minimalistic-builds to see if they can
     help guide the preparation of an ExternalProject_Add Qt build.

Other nice to haves:

0.  Smarter, view aware wireframes for BoTs (RTree may be useful?  Can we do
    points with normals to represent small triangles?  Incorporate bounding box
    drawing in some fashion...)

1.  gl2ps based vector output option for screengrab (may be able to replace postscript dm backend)

2.  Might be fun to see if we could combine https://github.com/ioppermann/ezMPEG and
    https://github.com/phoboslab/pl_mpeg to get a minimal video recording and playback going for
    the display mangers...

    For straight up capture this might be even simpler:  https://github.com/charlietangora/gif-h

    (Note the idea here is a very simple, straightforward, unoptimized ability with minimal code complexity
     Any use of output for something real would want to re-encode for sane file sizes...)


A note about RTG.rtg_vlfree - took a whack at removing most of the uses of the
global, but first attempt failed to take into account RT_DB_INTERNAL_INIT
initializations of rt_db_internal copies.  The vlfree pointer needs to be in
both db_i and rt_db_internal to be available to the various levels of the logic
that need vlfree, but if we're standing up a RT_DB_INTERNAL_INIT we need to
provide the vlfree pointer from somewhere else.  The code has over 170 calls to
RT_DB_INTERNAL_INIT, which will have to be checked and adjusted to set the
correct information.  The simplest thing is probably to simply alter
RT_DB_INTERNAL_INIT to require a struct bu_list pointer for vlfree.  Also need
to check to see if any db_i containers are created in similar fashion.
