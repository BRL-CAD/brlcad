Even if we can get a Tcl/Tk free stack working fully, users will need an option
for a Tcl prompt if we are going to support .mgedrc customizations.

May be worth exploring whether we can get away with using just the minimal
bootstrap version of jimtcl's library:

https://github.com/msteveb/jimtcl

The script make-bootstrap-jim can produce a single .c file:

./make-bootstrap-jim > jimtcl0.c

This file can in turn be compiled to a shared lib in CMake with:

add_library(jimtcl0 SHARED jimtcl0.c)
target_compile_definitions(jimtcl0 PUBLIC JIM_BOOTSTRAP_LIB_ONLY)

Would need to be tested, but if it can provide a MGED-style Tcl prompt that is
sufficient for scripting purposes and loading .mgedrc files it would be a far
simpler integration than the all-up libtcl build...
