#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Local Copies of External Libraries
#
# BRL-CAD depends on a variety of external libraries and tools -
# rather than fail if those requirements are not satisfied, we build
# local copies at need.
#
# There are three overall approaches to the handling of these
# dependencies:
#
# 1.  Auto - detect system libraries and use them if suitable,
#     otherwise build and use the local copy.  This is the default
#     approach.
#
# 2.  Bundled - regardless of system conditions, build and use all
#     bundled libraries.
#
# 3.  System - fail to build if the system libraries do not satisfy
#     requirements.  This is primarily useful for distributions that
#     want to ensure packages are using external libraries.
#
# In addition to the broad toplevel control, individual libraries can
# also be overridden - for example, if the toplevel setting is for
# Bundled libs, it is still possible to request a system library in
# individual cases.
