# Because we're using Itcl 3, we have to check and see if it's present A system
# install of Tcl/Tk may or may not have the older version.
#
# This is the only Tcl package we use that we can safely/reliably test for -
# the others all depend on Tcl/Tk, and it is not possible to successfully load
# Tcl/Tk packages requiring Tk on a non-graphical system (such as a Continuous
# Integration runner.)  Tk itself cannot be loaded successfully without
# creating a graphical window, so there is no option for a "headless" start of
# Tk for testing purposes.  That limitation thus propagates to all packages
# that require Tk.
#
# This limitation is unfortunate in the case of Itk, Tkhtml and Tktable. The
# best we will be able to do will be to key off of the Itcl/Tk build settings,
# which will mean that we won't be able to detect cases where Itcl and Tk *are*
# installed but the others are not.
