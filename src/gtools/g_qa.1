.SH NAME
g_qa \- a BRL-CAD geometry analysis tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "g_qa " "[options] model.g objects"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I g_qa 
program computes and reports the weight, and volume of the 
.I objects
specified from the given 
.I model.g
geometric description.
It also reports overlaps.
Only the 
.I objects
from the database specified on the command line are analyzed.
It works by shooting grids of rays from the three axis-aligned directions (sometimes called 
\fIviews\fR).  
The resulting volume/weight calculations for each view are compared to each other.
The grid of rays is progressively refined until the results from all three views
agree within a user specifiable tolerance, or a limit on grid refinement is reached.
.P
For weight computation, the density of every region must be specified.  Densities are specified as an index into a table of density values.
This index is stored in the 
.I GIFTmater 
attribute of each region.
.P
The density table consists of three columns: 
an integer index value, a floating point density value specified in grams/cm^3, and an optional text string describing the material
.in -5
.P
For example:
.sp 1
.in +5
.br
1	7.84		Carbon Steel
.br
2	7.82		Carbon Tool Steel
.br
3	2.7		Aluminum, 6061-T6
.br
4	2.74		Aluminum, 7079-T6
.br
5	8.9		Copper, pure
.br
6	19.32		Gold, pure
.br
7	8.03		Stainless, 18Cr-8Ni
.br
8	7.47		Stainless 27Cr
.br
9	7.715		Steel, tool
.in -5n
.P
The first column is the index value to which the GIFTmater attribute of a region is set to select the given material type (density value).
.P
The table is typically created in an external file using a text editor.  The file is imported to the database
as the binary object
.B _DENSITIES
when complete.  To import the text file into the database, the following comand is used.
.IP

.B dbbinary \-i u c _DENSITIES 
.I filename

.SH WEIGHT REPORTING
If weight calculation is slected, for each 
.I object
specified on the command line, a volume and weight is calculated and reported.

.SH OVERLAP REPORTING

For each pair of objects which overlap, the tool reports the two regions which overlap, the maximum line-of-sight thickness of the overlap, and the in-hit location of the ray which caused that maximum overlap thickness.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A analysis_flags
Specifies which computations are to be performed.  The parameter is one or more of the following:
.B a, o, w, v,
for 
.I all, overlaps, weight
and 
.I volume 
respectively.  Only those reports requested will be provided.  The default is 
.I all.

.TP
.B \-a azimuth_deg
Sets a rotation (in degrees) of the coordinate system by a given amount about the Z axis.  See also:
.B \-e
.TP
.B \-e elevation_deg
Sets a rotation (in degrees) of the coordinate system by a given elevation from the XY plane (rotation about X axis?).
See also
.B \-a
.TP
.B \-f filename
Specifies that density values should be taken from an external file instead of from the _DENSITIES object in the database.
This can be useful when developing the density table with a text editor, prior to importing it to the geometric database.
.TP
.B \-g grid_spacing\fI[,lim]\fR
Specifies the initial spacing between rays in the grids,
and optionally a limit on how far the grid can be refined.
The first value indicates the inital spacing between grid rays.  
If the optional second argument, "\fI,lim\fR",
is specified, it indicates a lower bound on how fine the gridspacing may get before computation is terminated.
The grid spacing may be specified with units.  For example:
.B 5mm
or 
.B 10in.
If units are not provided, millimeters are presumed to be the units.
The default values are 50.0mm and 0.5mm, which is equivalent to specifying: 
.sp
.ti +5
.br
.B \-g 50.0mm,0.5mm

.TP
.B \-G
Specifies that the program should create new 
.I assembly combinations
in the geometry database to represent the overlap pairs.  If regions 
.I rod.r
and 
.I disk.r
overlap, this option will cause the creation of an assembly called _OVERLAP_rod.r_disk.r which includes the following items:
.in +5
.br
.I rod.r
.br
.I disk.r
.br
.I _OVERLAPS_rod.r_disk.r
.in -5

The last of these is an object to represent the overlapping area so that it can be easily seen.  
The default is that no groups are created.
.TP
.B \-n num_hits
Specifies that the grid be refined until each region has at least 
.I num_hits
ray intersections.
The default is 1 (that is, each region must be hit at least once).
This limit is not applied per-view, but rather per-analysis.
So for example, it is accepted that a thin object might not be hit from one view at all, but hit when shooting from other views.
.TP
.B \-P ncpu
Specifies that
.I ncpu
CPU's should be used for performing the caluclation.  Note that
specifying more cpus than are present on the machine does not increase
the number of computation threads.  By default, all local cpu's are
utilized.  This option exists primarily to reduce the number of
computation threads from the machine maximum.
.TP
.BI "-r" " bits"
Specifies which types of reports to produce.
If, after an optional minus sign,
.I bits
begins with either ``0x'' or ``0X'',
the remainder is interpreted in hexadecimal.
Otherwise, if
.I bits
begins with ``0'',
the remainder is interpreted in octal.
Otherwise,
.I bits
is interpreted in decimal.
The meaning of the individual bits is as follows:
.in +5
 1 overlaps
.in -5
.in +5
 2 contiguous unlike airs
.in -5
.in +5
 4 unconfined airs
.in -5
.in +5
 8 air first on rays
.in -5
.in +5
16 air last on rays
.in -5
.in +5
32 vacuums.
.in -5
If there was no initial minus sign, then
.I bits
specifies which report types to produce.
The minus sign implies complementation:
when it is present,
.I bits
specifies which report types
.I not
to produce.
The default is 1 (report only overlaps).  To specify all reports, a value of 63 should be used.

.TP
.B \-S samples_per_axis_min
Specifies that the grid spacing will be initially refined so that at least
.I samples_per_axis_min
will be shot along each axis of the bounding box of the model.
For example, if the objects specified have a bounding box of 0 0 0 -> 4 3 2 and the grid spacing is 1.0, specifying the option
.B \-S 4
will cause the initial grid spacing to be adjusted to 0.5 so that 4 samples will be shot across the Z dimension of the bounding box.
The default is to assure 10 rays per model grid axis.

.TP
.B \-s samples_per_axis_min
This is like the 
.B \-S 
option except that the smallest bounding box dimensions (for primitive shapes) in the model are
used instead of the model bounding box.
This typically creates very fine grid spacing, and long runtimes, with higher accuracy.
.TP
.B \-t overlap_tol_dist
Specifies that overlaps less than 
.I overlap_tol_dist
will not be reported.
The default is 0.0 so that all overlaps are reported.
.TP
.B \-U use_air
Specifies the Boolean value 
.I use_air
which indicates whether regions which are marked as "air" should be retained and included in the raytrace.
.B Unlike other BRL-CAD raytracing applications the default is to retain air in the raytracing.
The 
.B \-U 0
option causes air regions to be discarded prior to raytracing.
.TP
.B \-u units
Specify the units used when reporting values.  
If this option is not specified, the current editing units are used.
This option can be used to override this behavior.
Possible values include: 
.I XXX what are the possible values XXX?
.TP
.B \-V volume_tolerance
Specifies a volumetric tolerance value which the 3 view computations must be within for computation to complete.  
The default value is 0.5 cc  For large complex objects (such as entire vehicles) this values must often be adjusted upwards to achieve
reasonable runtimes (or even completion).  
Given the approximate sampling nature of the algorithm, most of the time the three separate view computations will not agree identically.
Only one of -T and -W may be specified.  The last one specified on the command line wins.  
.TP
.B \-W weight_tolerance
This is like the volume tolerance (\fI-T\fR), but is applied to the weight computation results, not the volume computation results.  
Only one of -T and -W may be specified.  The last one specified on the command line wins.  
The weight computation tolerance is probably more appropriate when doing whole-vehicle analysis
