.SH NAME
g_qa \- a BRL-CAD quantitative geometry analysis tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "g_qa " "[options] model.g objects"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I g_qa
program computes and reports a variety of characteristics of the
.I objects
specified from the given
.I model.g
geometric description.
The characteristics which can be computed include
.B weight, volume, overlaps, exposed air, gaps/voids,
and
.B adjacent air.
.\"and
.\".B interfaces.
Only the
.I objects
from the database specified on the command line are analyzed.
.P
It works by shooting grids of rays from the three axis-aligned directions (sometimes called
\fIviews\fR).


For Volume/Weight calculations the resulting calculations for each view are compared to each other.
The grid of rays is progressively refined until the results from all three views
agree within a user-specifiable tolerance, or a limit on grid refinement is reached.
.P
For error and interface calculations, the grid is refined until an error is found or the grid refinement
limit is reached.
.P
When multiple calculations are performed, the most extensive path is taken.
For example, if weight and overlap calculations are performed, then the grid
will be refined until the refinement limit is reached, or an overlap is
detected.

.SH VOLUME AND WEIGHT CALCULATION
If volume or weight calculation is selected a value is calculated and reported
For each
.I object
specified on the command line.
.B Note that if there are overlaps or other errors in the geometry the values reported will be invalid.

.P
For weight computation, the density of every region must be specified.
Densities are specified as an index in a table of density values.
This index is stored in the
.I GIFTmater
attribute of each region (typically set with the
.I edcodes
or
.I adjust
commands in MGED).
.P
The density table consists of three columns:
.IP
.B An integer index value.
This is the value the to which the \fIGIFTmater\fR attribute will be set to select this material for the region.
.IP
.B A floating point density value.
This is the density for the material, and is specified in \fBgrams/cc\fR.
.IP
.B A name string
This is a name or description the material.
.in -5
.P
An example file might look like the following:
.IP
2	7.82		Carbon Tool Steel
.br
3	2.7		Aluminum, 6061-T6
.br
4	2.74		Aluminum, 7079-T6
.br
5	8.9		Copper, pure
.br
6	19.32		Gold, pure
.br
7	8.03		Stainless, 18Cr-8Ni
.br
8	7.47		Stainless 27Cr
.br
9	7.715		Steel, tool
.br
10	7.84		Carbon Steel
.P
The table is typically created in an external file using a text editor.

The geometry editor MGED automatically assigns an index value of
.B 1
to a newly created region.
While this default can be handy when a vast majority of objects are made from the same
material, it can lead to surprising errors when objects which are supposed to have a
certain weight are computed to have different weight because one or two regions
were not set to the correct, non-default index value.  As a result, it is advised that the index value
.B 1
never be used.  If this practice is followed, then an error message will be generated for any
regions which have not had their material index set to something other than the default.
.P
The user will typically want to run g_qa and verify the results using the
.I \-f
option (see below)
before importing the table into the database.
For example, if a material index is left out of the table,
it is easier to rectify the situation using the external file.
Once the table has been verified as correct and complete, it is imported to the database as the binary object
\fB_DENSITIES\fR.
To import the text file into the database, the following comand is used:
.IP
mged>
.B bo \-i u c _DENSITIES
.I filename

.SH GEOMETRY ERROR DETECTION
.P
All of these calculations run until an error is detected, or until the grid
refinement limit is reached.
.SH OVERLAP DETECTION
For each pair of regions that overlap, the tool reports the two regions that
overlap,
the maximum line-of-sight thickness of the overlap, and the in-hit location
of the ray that caused that maximum overlap thickness.
.P
Other analysis in the error detection category behave in a similar manner.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A \fR\fIanalysis_flags\fR
\fRSpecifies which computations are to be performed and reported.
The
.I analysis_flags
parameter is one or more of the following:
.in +5
.sp
\fBvalue	report generated\fR
.br
A		all
.br
a		Adjacent different air
.br
b		Bounding box dimensions
.br
e		Exposed air
.br
g		Gaps/voids
.br
o		Overlaps
.br
v		Volume
.br
w		Weight
.sp
.in -5
Only those reports requested will be provided.  The default is
.B -AA
to produce all reports.

.B Adjacent different air (a):
Detects air volumes which are next to each other but have different air_code values applied to the region.
This would typically indicate that the regions are different types of air,
such as crew_air (which fills the crew compartment of a vehicle) and engine_air (which surrounds the engine).
When these different types of air adjoin each other, it is generally considered a modeling error.

.B Bounding box dimensions (b):
Reports the dimensions of an axis-aligned box which fully encloses the
\fIobjects\fR.

.B Exposed air (e):
This causes checks to be made to see if the ray encounters air regions before
(or after all) solid objects.
It also checks to see if the ray moves from a void to an air region.
Typically, only the air inside a building or vehicle is modeled if the
purpose of the model is to support analysis of
that single structure/vehicle.
There are exceptions, such as when modeling larger environments for more
extended analysis purposes.

.B Gaps/voids (g):
This reports when there is more than
.I overlap_tol_dist
(see the
.B \-t
option below)
between objects on the ray path.  Note that not all gaps are errors.
For example, gaps between a wheel and a fender are expected (unless external air is modeled).
Typically, users should perform gap analysis on contained subsets of a model (such as passenger compartments)
rather than on whole vehicles.

.B Overlaps (o):
are two regions which occupy the same space.
In the real world, two objects may not occupy the same space.
This check is sometimes also known as \fIinterference checking\fR.
Two objects must overlap by at least
.I overlap_tol_dist
(see the
.B \-t
option below)
to be considered to overlap.  Overlap testing causes the grid spacing to
be refined until the limit is reached, or an overlap is detected.
See the
.B \-g
option below for details on setting the grid spacing.
Once overlaps have been detected, grid refinement is not done, and processing stops.

.B Volume (v):
Computes the volume of the
.I objects
specified on the command line.

.B Weight (w):
Computes the weight of the
.I objects
specified on the command line.
.TP
.B \-a \fR\fIazimuth_deg\fR
.B Not Implemented.
.br
\fRSets a rotation (in degrees) of the coordinate system by a given amount about the Z axis.
The default is 0.
See also:
.B \-e
.TP
.B \-e \fR\fIelevation_deg\fR
.B Not Implemented.
.br
\fRSets a rotation (in degrees) of the coordinate system by a given elevation from the XY plane (rotation about X axis?).
The default is 0.
See also
.B \-a
.TP
.B \-f \fR\fIfilename\fR
\fRSpecifies that density values should be taken from an external file instead of from the
.B _DENSITIES
object in the database.
This option can be useful when developing the density table with a text editor, prior to importing it to the geometric database.
.TP
.B \-g \fR\fI[initial_grid_spacing-]grid_spacing_limit\fR
\fRSpecifies a limit on how far the grid can be refined
and optionally the initial spacing between rays in the grids.
The first value (if present) indicates the inital spacing between grid rays.
The mandatory argument, "\fIgrid_spacing_limit\fR",
indicates a lower bound on how fine the gridspacing may get before computation is terminated.
In general, the \fIinitial_grid_spacing\fR value should be an integer power of
the \fIgrid_spacing_limit\fR.  So for example, if \fIgrid_spacing_limit\fR has
the value 1, then any \fIinitial_grid_spacing\fR specified should be in the
sequence 2, 4, 8, 16, 32... so that the grid will refine to precisely the
lower limit.
.\" Should the code force this issue?"
The grid spacing may be specified with units.  For example:
.B 5 mm
or
.B 10 in.
If units are not provided, millimeters are presumed to be the units.
.IP

The default values are 50.0 mm and 0.5 mm, which is equivalent to specifying:
.B \-g 50.0mm-0.5mm
or
.B \-g 50.0mm,0.5mm
on the command line.
This is a hard limit.  If other analysis constraints are not met, the grid
spacing will never be refined smaller than the minimum grid size to satisfy
another constraint.
The initial grid spacing is divided in half at each refinement step.  As a
result, if you desire a lower limit to actually be tested, then the initial
grid size must be a power of 2 greater.  For example, specifying -g10mm,1mm
would result in grid spacings of 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25 being used.  If the goal was
to exactly end at a 1mm grid, then values such as 8 or 16 should have been
chosen for the initial values.  This would result in testing 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
grid spacing values.

.TP
.B \-G
.br
.B Not Implemented.
.br
Specifies that the program should create new
.I assembly combinations
in the geometry database to represent the overlap pairs.
This flag is meaningless if overlap reporting is not turned on with the
.B \-A
option.
If regions
.I rod.r
and
.I disk.r
overlap, this option will cause the creation of an assembly called _OVERLAP_rod.r_disk.r which includes the following items:
.in +5
.br
.I rod.r
.br
.I disk.r
.br
.I _OVERLAP_lines_rod.r_disk.r
.in -5

The last item is an object to represent the overlapping area so that it can be easily seen.
The default is that no groups are created.
.TP
.B \-n \fR\fInum_hits\fR
\fRSpecifies that the grid be refined until each region has at least
.I num_hits
ray intersections.  Applies only when Weight or Volume calculations are being performed.
This limit is not applied per-view, but rather per-analysis.
So for example, it is accepted that a thin object might not be hit from one view at all, but hit when shooting from other views.
.IP
The default is 1.
Hence, each region must be intersected by a ray at least once during the analysis.
.TP
.B \-N \fR\fInum_views\fR
\fRSpecifies that only the first
.I num_views
should be computed.  This is principly a debugging option.
.TP
.B \-p
Specifies that
.I g_qa
should produce plot files for each of the analysis it performs.  These can be overlaid on the geometry in
.I mged
with the
.I overlay
command to help visualize the analysis results.
Each of the different analysis types write to a separate plot file and use different colors for drawing.
.TP
.B \-P \fR\fIncpu\fR
\fRSpecifies that
.I ncpu
CPUs should be used for performing the calculation.
By default, all local CPUs are utilized.
This option exists primarily to reduce the number of
computation threads from the machine maximum.
Note that specifying more CPUs than are present on the machine does not increase
the number of computation threads.
.TP
.B \-r
Indicates that
.I g_qa
should print per-region statistics for weight and volume as well as the values for the objects specified on the command line.
.TP
.B \-S \fR\fIsamples_per_model_axis\fR
\fRSpecifies that the grid spacing will be initially refined so that at least
.I samples_per_axis_min
will be shot along each axis of the bounding box of the model.
For example, if the objects specified have a bounding box of 0 0 0 -> 4 3 2 and the grid spacing is 1.0, specifying the option
.B \-S 4
will cause the initial grid spacing to be adjusted to 0.5 so that 4 samples will be shot across the Z dimension of the bounding box.
The default is to assure 1 rays per model grid axis.
.TP
.B \-t \fR\fIoverlap_tolerance\fR
\fRSets the tolerance for computing overlaps.  the
.I overlap_tolerance
must be a positive number equal to or greater than 0.0.
Any overlap smaller than the value specified will be ignored.
The default value is 0.0, which causes any overlap to be reported/processed.
The value may be specified with a unit specifier such as:
.B -t 1.0mm
or
.B -t 0.25in.
.TP
.B \-U \fR\fIuse_air\fR
\fRSpecifies the Boolean value (0 or 1) for
.I use_air
which indicates whether regions which are marked as "air" should be retained and included in the raytrace.
.B Unlike other BRL-CAD raytracing applications the default is to retain air in the raytracing.
The
.B \-U 0
option causes air regions to be discarded prior to raytracing.
If you turn off use_air, and request any analysis that requires it (see
.I \-A
above) then the program will exit with an error message.
.TP
.B \-u \fR\fIdistane,volume,weight\fR
\fRSpecify the units used when reporting values.  Values must be comma delimited and provided in the order
\fIdistance\fR,\fIvolume\fR,\fIweight\fR.  For example:
.B \-u ``cm,cu ft,kg''
or \fB\-u ,,kg\fR (the latter example sets only the weight units).
Note that unit values with spaces in their names such as
.I cu ft
must be contained in quotes for the shell to keep the values together.

The default units are millimeters, cubic millimeters, and grams.
.TP
.B \-v
Turns on verbose reporting of computation progress.  This is useful for
learning how the computation is progressing, and what tolerances are causing
further computation to be necessary.
.TP
.B \-V \fR\fIvolume_tolerance[units]\fR
\fRSpecifies a volumetric tolerance value that the three view computations must be within for computation to complete.
If volume calculation is selected and this option is not set, then the tolerance is set to
1/10,000 of the volume of the model.
For large, complex objets (such as entire vehicles), this value might need to be
set larger to achieve reasonable runtimes (or even completion).
Given the approximate sampling nature of the algorithm, the
three separate view computations will not usually produce identical results.
.TP
.B \-W \fR\fIweight_tolerance[units]\fR
\fRThis is like the volume tolerance, \fB\-T\fR, but is applied to the weight computation results,
not the volume computation results.

The weight computation tolerance is probably more appropriate when doing whole-vehicle analysis.
If weight computation is selected, it is set to a value equal to the weight of an object 1/100
the size of the model, which is made of the most dense material in the table.
