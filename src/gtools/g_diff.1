.SH NAME
g_diff \- a BRL-CAD differential geometry comparator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "g_diff " "[-e][-m] [-f] [-v] model1.g model2.g"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I G_diff
compares the two BRL-CAD models specified on the comand line. The results of this comparison
are written to standard out in a human readable form describing the changes from model1 to model2.
If the
.I -m
option is exercised, the output will be a script, readable by mged(1), that will perform the
necessary changes to model1 to make it a copy of model2. The produced script makes extensive use
of the
.I db get, db put,
and
.I db adjust
commands in mged(1). A few solid types are not supported by these commands, and changes involving these
solids are merely noted (the script will not actually be capable of performing all the changes in this case).
The
.I -e
option selections evolutionary mode, which attempts to guess if a change in a region is due to an evolutionary change or a reworking.
The output is similar to -m, but it is NOT mged readable.
The
.I -f
option requests that all floating point numerical comparisons be done in single precision rather
than the default double precision. This may be useful when comparing different format databases.
The
.I -v
option requests that the default attributes of each region in both files be checked for
consistency. Any inconsistencies are written to stderr.
.SH EXAMPLE
The command
.sp
.in +5
\fIg_diff -m uncle.g aunt.g > mged.script\fR
.in -5
.sp
will create a file named "mged.script" that may be sourced in mged(1) to change
uncle.g into aunt.g.

Reports of bugs should be submitted via the
.I cadbug.sh
shell script.
Alternatively, bugs or problems may be submitted by electronic mail
to <devs@brlcad.org>.
