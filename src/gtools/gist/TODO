* Instead of total projected surface area, projected surface area for
  front/back, left/right, and top/bottom would be more meaningful.

* Compute mass data (lots of requests, need density data)

* Showing axes vs showing "z up". Or give user options

* Include hashing method on Checksum (SHA1):  120EAB...

* Classification markings (overall with normal declass
  instructions). _GLOBAL attribute. Use RED box if classified

* Possibly include model filesize

* Bounding box information in gray area


Future
------

* Would be great if material data can be displayed in another
  page. List out the different materials used in the models, perhaps
  even broken down by percentage of total

* There will often be more than one top level assembly in each file
  and specifying which assembly may need to be an option.

* Geometry Type should breakdown the numbers of primitives (types of
  solids) - CSG, BOT, NURBS, NMG, DSP with CSG being all

* Option to display location of Ground_Plane_Offset attribute if not
  at the bottom of the target.  For example, a small boat in the
  water.

* physically based rendering

* colors and shaders set automatically based on naming patterns

* a second page that goes into more detail – e.g., exploded hierarchy
  diagram. (Would be great if a bigger hierarchy can be displayed in
  another page. More subassemblies (hierarchy))

* ability to add my agency/organization’s logo in the bottom
  right-hand corner

* show model origin?

* both metric and imperial units

NOTE:

When running this command:

rtwizard -s 1024 -a 35 -e 25 -i sample_models/shipping_container.g -c container_air.r -g shipping_container -G 10 -o "output/test.png"

The command does not throw an error although container_air.r is void
air.  Instead, it just generates a black image
