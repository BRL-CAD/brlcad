Soon
----

* Possibly include model filesize

* Possibly show how many components were not included in the hierarchy diagram instead of "..."


Future
------

* Would be great if material data can be displayed in another
  page. List out the different materials used in the models, perhaps
  even broken down by percentage of total

* There will often be more than one top level assembly in each file
  and specifying which assembly may need to be an option.

* Geometry Type should breakdown the numbers of primitives (types of
  solids) - CSG, BOT, NURBS, NMG, DSP with CSG being all
  <arb8|arb7|arb6|arb5|arb4|arbn|ars|datum|ehy|ell|ell1|epa|eto|extrude|grip|half|hyp|part|pipe|pnts|rcc|rec|rhc|rpc|rpp|sketch|sph|tec|tgc|tor|trc>

* Option to display location of Ground_Plane_Offset attribute if not
  at the bottom of the target.  For example, a small boat in the
  water.

* physically based rendering

* colors and shaders set automatically based on naming patterns

* a second page that goes into more detail â€“ e.g., exploded hierarchy
  diagram. (Would be great if a bigger hierarchy can be displayed in
  another page. More subassemblies (hierarchy))

* both metric and imperial units

* Possibly include model filesize

NOTE:

When running this command:

rtwizard -s 1024 -a 35 -e 25 -i sample_models/shipping_container.g -c container_air.r -g shipping_container -G 10 -o "output/test.png"

The command does not throw an error although container_air.r is void
air.  Instead, it just generates a black image
