/**
 * The LayoutChoice class stores a layout encoding along with
 * providing the functionality to determine how to place elements on a
 * page if that layout were to be selected.  The class encodes a
 * layout using two variables: map and "lockRows".
 *
 * The map is encoded as a string, storing the 2D grid which makes up
 * how the images will be placed.  Depending on the value of
 * "lockRows", either a row-major (true) or column-major (false)
 * ordering will be followed when placing the images.
 *
 * Each orthogonal face is encoded as a character.  Each row is
 * terminated by a '\n'.  The mapping is as follows: F: front, T: top,
 * R: right, L: left, B: back, b: bottom, A: ambient occlusion Empty
 * space is encoded as a '.', where nothing should be placed.
 *
 * When lockRows is true, all images on the same row MUST have the
 * same height.
 *
 * When lockRows is false, all images on the same column MUST have the
 * same width.
 *
 * Here's an example of how LayoutChoice("TbFR\n..BL\n..AA\n", false)
 * will be represented:
 *
 *  ---------------
 * | T | b | F | R |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * |   |   | B | L |
 * |---|---|-------|
 * |   |   |  Amb  |
 *  ---------------
 *
 * The diagram above shows the grid layout for the preceeding
 * "LayoutChoice" specification.  Since "lockRows" is false, a
 * column-major ordering is used.  The top, bottom, front, and right
 * views will be placed first at the top of the page.  Then, the back
 * view will be placed immediately below the front view, with the same
 * width as the front view.  A similar process is followed for the
 * left view (placed below the right view).  Finally, the ambient view
 * is placed just below the back and left views.  is therefore useful
 * for models where the top/bottom images are tall whilst the other
 * views aren't.
 *
 * The ambient view will not protrude any space that is not marked as
 * "A".
 *
 * The initCoordinates() "initializes" the layout, properly setting
 * the coordinates of each image depending on the model bounding box,
 * maintaining both proportionality and maximum space usage.
 *
 * The getTotalCoverage() returns a determined value proportional to
 * the amount of whitespace used.  Generally, the higher this value,
 * the better match this layout is for a model.
