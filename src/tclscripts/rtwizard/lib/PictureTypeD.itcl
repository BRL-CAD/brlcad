# PictureTypeD.itcl
#
# This class defines the process necessary to build a BRL-CAD
# picture of Type "D". This is a full-color image mixed with a
# line drawing. This image type differs from Type C in that the
# objects rendered in the line drawing may differ from those
# rendered in the full-color image.
