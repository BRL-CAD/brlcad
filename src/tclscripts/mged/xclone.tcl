# xclone
#
# Description -
#       This clones an object and xpushes the clone.
#
# Note -
#       At the moment, clone does not work properly for some of its operations
#       when there are matrices hanging above a combination's members. To get
#       around this the object is cloned without transforms and xpushed. The
#       result of this is clone again, if necessary, applying any specified
#       transformations.
#

    # Begin hack section
    set remaining [lrange $args 0 end-1]
    set last [lindex $args end]

    if {[catch {clone $last} iclone]} {
	return $iclone
    }

    if {[catch {xpush $iclone} msg]} {
	killtree $iclone
	return $msg
    }

    if {[llength $remaining] < 1} {
	return $iclone
    }

    set args [lreplace $args end end $iclone]
    catch {eval clone $args} clone

    # End hack section
