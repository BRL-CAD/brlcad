Release 6.0 of BRL-CAD introduced a new geometry file format with
several new features.

To convert an older geometry file to the new format click the
\"upgrade\" button below.  The existing file will be saved with an
extension of \"R4\" added to the filename.  The upgraded file will be
given the original filename.

The primary benefits of the new file format to the user include:

    Machine independent format:
	The new file format is machine independent.  A database can be used
	on a machine of any architecture without any conversion.  There is
	no need to convert files with g2asc/asc2g when moving files between
	machines.

	In previous releases when a geometry database was moved from one
	machine to another of a different architecture (CPU), the database had
	to be converted from binary to ASCII format, moved, and converted from
	ASCII to binary on the new machine.

    Double precision floating point values for all parameters:
	The new format stores all floating point values in IEEE 754 double
	precision form.  This increases the range and precision of numbers
	which can be represented.  The result is that more accurate geometry
	can be created, and larger objects can be modeled.

	In previous releases, many parameters were stored in single precision
	floating point values.  While this reduced storage requirements, it
	has become a severe limitation on modeling.

    Unlimited length object names:
	The new file format uses unlimited length strings for all
	database objects.  This permits much more descriptive names to be
	used by modelers.

	In previous releases, object names were limited to 15
	characters in length.

    Object attributes:
	The new file format allows arbitrary text information to be stored
	with each database object.  These text attributes take the form of
	<name> <value> pairs.  Examples of possible use include assigning
	a stock number to a \"StockNumber\" attribute, or
	\"left roadwheel #1\" to a \"MUVES_Component\" attribute.  See the \"attr\"
	command for more information.

    Binary objects:
	Arbitrary data can now be stored into and extracted
	from the database.  This data might be used for geometric
	purposes (such as elevation data for DSP primitives, or
	textures for the texture shader).  It might simply be data
	that the user wants to keep with the geometry (such as the
	original commercial CAD representation from which the model
	was constructed).  Alternatively, it might be data that an
	outboard processing module needs (such as the MUVES region-map
	file contents).  See the \"binary\" command for more information.

	Previously, such information had to be stored in ancillary files.

    Hidden objects:
	Objects can now be \"hidden\" from the default listing of file
	contents.  This allows old geometry to be kept for historical
	reference without cluttering the current listings.  See the \"hide\"
	command for more information.


Release 6.0 of BRL-CAD retains the ability to edit and use geometry
files created with previous releases (4.0 through 5.4) of the package.
The features mentioned above will not be available when using geometry
files retained in the old format.

Support for the previous file format may be removed in a future release.
