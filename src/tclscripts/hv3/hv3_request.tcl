catch {namespace eval hv3 { set {version($Id$)} 1 }}

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file contains the implementation of two types used by hv3:
#
#     ::hv3::request
#

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Class ::hv3::request
#
#     Instances of this class are used to interface between the protocol
#     implementation and the hv3 widget.
#
# OVERVIEW:
#
# HOW CHARSETS ARE HANDLED:
#
#     The protocol implementation (the thing that calls [$download append]
#     and [$download finish]) passes binary data to this object. This
#     object converts the binary data to utf-8 text, based on the encoding
#     assigned to the request. An encoding may be assigned either by an
#     http header or a <meta> tag.
#
#     Assuming the source of the data is http (or https), then the
#     encoding may be specified by way of a Content-Type HTTP header.
#     In this case, when the protocol configures the -header option
#     (which it does before calling [append] for the first time) the
#     -encoding option will be automatically set.
#
#
# OPTIONS:
#
#     The following options are set only by the requestor (the Hv3 widget)
#     for the protocol to use as request parameters:
#
#       -cachecontrol
#       -uri
#       -postdata
#       -requestheader
#       -enctype
#       -encoding
#
#     This is set by the requestor also to show the origin of the request:
#
#       -hv3
#
#     These are set by the requestor before the request is made to
#     configure callbacks invoked by this object when requested data
#     is available:
#
#       -incrscript
#       -finscript
#
#     This is initially set by the requestor. It may be modified by the
#     protocol implementation before the first invocation of -incrscript
#     or -finscript is made.
#
#       -mimetype
#
#     The protocol implementation also sets:
#
#       -header
#       -expectedsize
#
# METHODS:
#
#     Methods used by the protocol implementation:
#
#         append DATA
#         finish
#         fail
#         authority         (return the authority part of the -uri option)
#
#     finish_hook SCRIPT
#         Configure the object with a script to be invoked just before
#         the object is about to be destroyed. If more than one of
#         these is configured, then the scripts are called in the
#         same order as they are configured in (i.e. most recently
#         configured is invoked last).
#
#     reference
#     release
#
#     data
#     encoding
#

    # The requestor (i.e. the creator of the ::hv3::request object) sets the
    # following configuration options. The protocol implementation may set the
    # -mimetype option before returning.
    #
    # The -cachecontrol option may be set to the following values:
    #
    #     * normal             (try to be clever about caching)
    #     * no-cache           (never return cached resources)
    #     * relax-transparency (return cached resources even if stale)
    #

    set O(-postdata) ""
    set O(-mimetype) ""
    set O(-enctype) ""

    # The hv3 widget that issued this request. This is used
    # (a) to notify destruction of root request,
    # (b) by the handler for home:// uris and
    # (c) to call [$myHtml reset] in restartCallback.
    #
    set O(-hv3) ""

    # The protocol implementation sets this option to contain the
    # HTTP header (or its equivalent). The format is a serialised array.
    # Example:
    #
    #     {Set-Cookie safe-search=on Location http://www.google.com}
    #
    # The following http-header types are handled locally by the
    # configure-header method, as soon as the -header option is set:
    #
    #     Set-Cookie         (Call ::hv3::the_cookie_manager method)
    #     Content-Type       (Set the -mimetype option)
    #     Content-Length     (Set the -expectedsize option)
    #
    set O(-header) ""

    set O(-requestheader) ""

    # Expected size of the resource being requested. This is used
    # for displaying a progress bar when saving remote resources
    # to the local filesystem (aka downloadin').
    #
    set O(-expectedsize) ""

    # Callbacks configured by the requestor.
    #
    set O(-incrscript) ""
    set O(-finscript) ""

    # This -encoding option is used to specify explicit conversion of
    # incoming http/file data.
    # When this option is set, [http::geturl -binary] is used.
    # Then [$self append] will call [encoding convertfrom].
    #
    # See also [encoding] and [suggestedEncoding] methods.
    #
    set O(-encoding) ""

    # True if the -encoding option has been set by the transport layer.
    # If this is true, then any encoding specified via a <meta> element
    # in the main document is ignored.
