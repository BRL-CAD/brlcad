/** @file dbl_to_int_test.cxx
 *
 * This is an experiment testing a way to detect, for a given floating point
 * number, the maximum number of digits we can save if we convert it to a long.
 * We "snap" from floating point to integer space when we need certain
 * categories of math operations to be robust (floating point types have some
 * nasty and subtle limits in that respect.)
 *
 * The idea is that for any given geometry, its vertex coordinates will be part
 * of a small subset of the total floating point space, so if we find the
 * number in the set that bounds our upper limit on how large a factor we can
 * use without overflowing when we convert it to integer, using that factor
 * will result in less information loss when we transition from integer back
 * into floating point - i.e., we'll be saving as much info as the constraints
 * of the integer container size and input sizes allow.  (Clipper uses a
 * snapping technique for robust polygon boolean operations, but with a fixed
 * scale factor.)
 *
 * Here we're just testing a single number, but the idea would be to apply this
 * individually to each number in a set, and find the smallest viable scale
 * factor to apply to that set.  This way we would lose at little information
 * as possible due to the type conversion.
