 *
 *	This routine is used to plot a string of ASCII symbols
 *  on the plot being generated, using a built-in set of fonts
 *  drawn as vector lists.
 *
 *	Internally, the basic font resides in a 10x10 unit square.
 *  Externally, each character can be thought to occupy one square
 *  plotting unit;  the 'scale'
 *  parameter allows this to be changed as desired, although scale
 *  factors less than 10.0 are unlikely to be legible.
