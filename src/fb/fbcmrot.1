.SH NAME
fbcmrot \- rotate the color map
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fbcmrot
.RB [ \-h ]
.RB [ \-i\  increment]
steps_per_second
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fbcmrot
rotates the color map, cycling each color map entry through all of the
color map positions.
The
.I frames_per_second
is the number of shifts per second to generate.
This value can be fractional.
An unspecified frame rate causes the program to cycle through
the color maps as fast as possible.
A
.I frames_per_second
of zero causes the program to make one step and then exit.
.PP
Each step shifts the colormap one position toward smaller
values (with a linear colormap this would cause displayed pixels
to get brighter).  The
.BR \-i\  increment
option allows a shift of more than one position.  If
.I increment
is negative, the colormap will be shifted the opposite
direction (toward larger values).
.PP
By default, the framebuffer is assumed to be 512x512 pixels.
Specifying the
.B \-h
flag changes this to 1024x1024.
This is only important for devices such as the Adage framebuffers
which operate differently depending on the display size.
