.SH NAME
fblabel \- display a text string on a framebuffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fblabel
.RB [ \-hca ]
.RB [ \-F\  framebuffer]
.RB [ \-f\  fontname]
.RB [ \-C\  r/g/b]
.RB x_position
.RB y_position
.RB text_string
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fblabel
writes a text string to
the image on the currently selected framebuffer.
The text string will be filtered to the image currently
displayed.
Use
.IR fbpoint (1)
to determine where to position the text string.
The lower left corner of the text string starts
displaying at the x and y position given.
The environment variable FB_FILE specifies
the current framebuffer, see
.IR brlcad (1).
Alternatively, the framebuffer may be explicitly specified
by using the
.B \-F
flag.
.PP
By default, the
requested framebuffer size, is assumed to be 512x512 pixels.
Specifying the
.B \-h
flag changes the size to 1024x1024.
.PP
The
.B \-c
flag causes the screen to be cleared before the text string is displayed.
The default behavior is to label the current image
without clearing the screen.
.PP
The
.B \-a
The flag causes the text not to be filtered against the frame buffer image.
.PP
The
.B \-C r/g/b
specifies red, green, and blue rgb values [0..255] for the text.
The default color is white.
.PP
The
.B \-f fontname
flag will change the current default
font from nonie.r.12 to "/usr/lib/vfont/fontname".
.SH "FONTS"
.I Fblabel
expects the Berkley fonts in the directory /usr/lib/vfont.
The fonts are expected to be in Vax byte order,
even if that is not the natural byte order of the machine,
to avoid having to create a font converter.
