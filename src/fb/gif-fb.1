.SH NAME
gif-fb \- display GIF file on frame buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.CW gif-fb
[
.CW -F
.I "frame buffer name"
] [
.CW -c
] [
.CW -i
.I "image number"
] [
.CW -o
] [
.CW -v
] [
.CW -z
] [
.I "GIF file name"
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.CW gif-fb
displays on a frame buffer the images described by a
CompuServe GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) file.
.SS Options
.TP "\w'\f\*(pf-f\fP \fIframe buffer name\fP\ \ \ 'u"
\f\*(pf-F\fP \fIframe buffer name\fP
Outputs to the specified frame buffer
instead of the one specified by the
.CW FB_FILE
environment variable
(or the default frame buffer, if
.CW FB_FILE
is not set).
The frame buffer size requested will be the same as
the input GIF screen size.
The actual size obtained depends on details of the specific frame buffer.
.TP
.CW -c
Uses all 8 bits per channel for color maps supplied in the GIF file,
overriding the color resolution specified in the GIF file.
(While technically a violation of the GIF ``standard'',
apparently some GIF implementations assume this interpretation.)
.TP
\f\*(pf-i\fP \fIimage number\fP
Displays just the specified image
(starting counting with 1),
rather than displaying all images as the GIF specification requires.
.TP
.CW -o
(``overlay'')\
Skips the initial clearing of the frame buffer
to the background color specified in the GIF file.
.TP
.CW -v
(``verbose'')\
Also prints information about the GIF images
on the standard error output.
.TP
.CW -z
(``zoom'')\
Uses the zoom capability of the current framebuffer to
make the image as large as possible on the screen while
preserving a square aspect ratio to the pixels.
This means that the zoom factor in X and Y will be equal to
the smaller of the two possible zooms.
.TP
.I "GIF file name"
Specifies the GIF input file to be translated,
rather than reading the file from the standard input.
.SH DISCUSSION
The GIF ``standard'' is far from an ideal specification for frame buffer images,
but it has been widely accepted in the personal computer arena,
and consequently there are a large number of images stored in GIF format
on bulletin-board systems and other information services.
Since most personal computer systems have GIF translators available for them,
.CW gif-fb
provides a means of converting most images from such systems
into a form suitable for processing with other BRL-CAD utilities.
.P
Notice that multiple images within a single GIF file
can achieve animation effects.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following is a typical invocation:
