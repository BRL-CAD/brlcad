.SH NAME
fb\(hyorle \- save a frame buffer image in old run-length encoded form
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fb-orle
.RB [ \-CShvw ]
.RB [ \-c { rgbwBG }]
.RB [ \-l
x y]
.RB [ \-p
x y] [file.rle]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I fb-orle\^
saves a frame buffer image in a file, using the
old University of Utah standard (Edition-2)
Run-Length Encoded (RLE) format.
This program is provided for compatability with the old RLE image
tools, and generally should not be used for saving new images,
except where compatability with the old tools is a factor.
The equivalent new tool is
.IR fb-rle(1) .
.PP
The environment
variable
.B
.SM FB_FILE
is used to select the display device (see
.IR brlcad(1) ).
If this variable is not set, the default device for your system will
be used.
If
.I file.rle\^
is not specified, the encoded file is written to standard output.
.I fb-orle\^
attempts to compress flat-colored areas
as much as possible.
This means that it is generally reasonable to save an entire
image, since in RLE format it will not take up much more file space
than extracting and saving only the
interesting portion of the image.
The default action is to encode only data
pixels and to save the background color separately, so that when the image
is restored all non-image pixels will be set to the background pixel value
stored in the RLE header.
Images saved in this mode may be displayed normally, or in ``overlay''
mode by the RLE decoder program (see
.IR orle-fb\^ (1)).
Alternatively, the
.B \-S
option may be used to RLE encode the background as well (recommended only
if you don't have a flat background).
.TP
.B \-C
Convert (``crunch'') an image with a non-standard color map so that the
RLE file created will redisplay with a standard color map.
Useful to preserve dramatic images created with wierd color maps
so that Gamma correction (for film) can then also be applied.
This option is recommended when producing images for export to other
display systems, so that variations in the interpretation of color maps
between different types of display hardware do
not affect the displayed image.
.TP
.B \-w
Convert the color image to black and white, and RLE encode that.
The red, green, and blue components of each
pixel are combined via the NTSC transform to get an intensity value (Y) which
is saved.  A more versatile tool for this is
.IR pix-bw (1).
.TP
.B \-S
Save all data in RLE format,
irrespective of whether it is background or not (``straight box save'').
It is not possible to
restore a file saved with
.B \-S
as an overlay.
.TP
.BI \-c x
Specify a color to use as the ``background''.
The character
.I x\^
is selected from the set
.B rgbwBG
(red, green, blue, white, Black, 18% Grey).
If this option is not specified, the pixel in the lower left corner
of the region being saved is used as the background color.
.TP
.BI \-l "x y"
Specify the size of the saved box.
This is useful if only a portion of the image is to be saved.
.TP
.BI \-p "x y"
Specify the upper left corner of the saved portion
of the image.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
The program will provide voluminous status information
on its standard error as it proceeds through encoding the image.
.TP
.B \-h
``hires'' flag.  Set both the height and width of the framebuffer
to 1024.  The default is 512x512.
