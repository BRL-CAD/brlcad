.SH NAME
gif2fb \- display GIF file on frame buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.CW gif2fb
[-h] [-v] [-F "frame buffer name"] "GIF file name"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.CW gif2fb
displays on a frame buffer the images described by a
CompuServe GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) file.
The
.I -F
option outputs to the specified frame buffer
instead of the one specified by the
.I FB_FILE
environment variable
(or the default frame buffer, if
.I FB_FILE
is not set).
The frame buffer size requested will be the same as
the input GIF screen size.
The actual size obtained depends on details of the specific frame buffer.
The
.I -h
option prints the GIF screen size on stderr. The
.I -v
option printd additional information about the GIF file on stderr.
The
.I "GIF file name"
Specifies the GIF input file to be translated,
rather than reading the file from the standard input.
