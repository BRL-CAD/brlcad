.SH NAME
fbzoom \- modify zoom and window parameters of a frame buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fbzoom
.RB [ \-F\  frame_buffer]
.RB [ \-h ]
.RB [ \-s\  image_sqrsize]
.RB [ \-w\  image_width]
.RB [ \-n\  image_height]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Using
.IR vi (1)
and/or
.IR emacs (1)
-like keystrokes,
.I fbzoom
allows interactive zooming and panning of a frame buffer.  Using the
optional command line arguments,
.PP
.TP
.B \-F\  frame_buffer
explicitly specifies the frame buffer.  Otherwise, the environment variable
.I FB_FILE
specifies
the current framebuffer, see
.IR brlcad (1).
.TP
.B \-h
changes the frame buffer size to 1024x1024.
By default, it is assumed to be 512x512 pixels.
.TP
.B \-s\  image_sqrsize
disaplays the image file as a square,
.B image_sqrsize
pixels per side (default is 512x512).
.TP
.B \-w\  image_width
disaplays the image
.B image_width
pixels wide (default is 512).
.TP
.B \-n\  image_height
disaplays the image
.B image_height
pixels high (default is 512).
.PP
.I Fbzoom
will display the image currently in the frame buffer and then act on commands
entered by the user.  Available commands are:
.PP

.TP
.B b ^V
zoom Bigger (*2)
.TP
.B s
zoom Smaller (*0.5)
.TP
.B +
zoom Bigger (+1)
.TP
.B -
zoom Smaller (-1)
.TP
.B h B
pan Left (1)
.TP
.B j N
pan Down (1)
.TP
.B k P
pan Up (1)
.TP
.B l F
pan Right (1)
.TP
.B H ^B
pan Left (many)
.TP
.B J ^N
pan Down (many)
.TP
.B K ^P
pan Up (many)
.TP
.B L ^F
pan Right (many)
.TP
.B T
toggle sense of pan commands
.TP
.B c
goto Center
.TP
.B z
zoom 1 1
.TP
.B r
Reset to normal
.TP
.B q
Exit
.TP
.B RETURN
Exit
.PP
Note that these commands change the way the frame buffer is viewed
but not the image in the frame buffer.
