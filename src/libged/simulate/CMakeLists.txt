  # https://stackoverflow.com/a/37019528
  #
  # Additionally, when compiling Bullet to produce static libs on Ubuntu,
  # it proved necessary to add -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON to
  # avoid linking errors.
  #
  # The need for static libs complicates searching for system installs, since
  # Linux package managers do provide shared versions (at least on Ubuntu,
  # there doesn't even seem to be an option for static libraries provided by
  # the OS?)
  #
  # To avoid finding versions that won't work for our build, we use a variation
  # on this trick:  https://www.scivision.dev/cmake-force-link-static-libs/
