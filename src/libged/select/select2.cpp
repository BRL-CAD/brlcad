/** @file libged/select.cpp
 *
 * The select command.
 *
 * "Sets" in BRL-CAD have some interesting complications, particularly when it
 * comes to geometric scenes.  Graphically visible scene objects representing
 * .g geometry always correspond to one instance of one solid, or a set of data
 * representing an evaluation of a composite object.
 *
 * Because there may be thousands of such objects in a scene, commands such as
 * "who" report "collapsed" top level groups that represent the highest level
 * paths that contain beneath them all the drawn solids.   Generally this
 * report will be more compact and informative to users than a detailed
 * itemization of individual instance shape objects.
 *
 * However, when defining selection sets, it gets more complex.  Building selection
 * sets graphically by interrogating the scene will build up sets of individual
 * shape objects.  If the correct sub-sets of those objects are selected, we can
 * conceptually regard a parent comb as being fully selected, if we so choose.
 * However, we do not always want the "fully selected" parent comb to replace
 * all of its children in the set, since different types of actions may
 * want/need to operate on the individual comb instances rather than the parent
 * comb as an aggregate whole.
 *
 * We thus need "expand" and "collapse" operations for sets, the former of
 * which will take each entry in the set and replace it with all of its child
 * leaf instances.
 *
 * Likewise, the "collapse" operation will look at the children contained in the set,
 * and for cases where all children are present, those children will be replaced
 * with one reference to the parent.  This will be done working "up" the various
 * trees until either all potential collapses are missing one or more children, or
 * all entries collapse to top level objects.
 *
 * Nor do we want to always either expand OR collapse - in some cases we want
 * exactly what was selected.  For example, if we have the tree
 *
 * a
 *  b
 *   c
 *    d
 *     e
 *
 * and we want to select and operate on /a/b/c, we can't simply collapse (which
 * will result in /a) or expand (which will result in /a/b/c/d/e).  If /a/b/c/d/e
 * is part of a larger selection set and we want to replace it with /a/b/c, to
 * avoid a confusing multiple-path-instance state the selection command will need
 * to ensure all selections below /a/b/c are removed in favor of /a/b/c.
 *
 * As an exercise, we consider a potential use of sets - selecting an instance of
 * an object in a scene for editing operations.  There are a number of things we
 * will need to know:
 *
 * The solids associated with the selected instance itself.  If a solid was
 * selected we already know where to get the editing wireframe, but if comb was
 * selected from the tree, there's more work to do.  We have the advantage of
 * explicitly knowing the level at which the editing operations will take place
 * (a tree selection would correspond to the previously discussed "insert"
 * operation to the set), but we will need a list of that comb's child solids
 * so we can create appropriate editing wireframe visual objects to represent
 * the comb in the scene.  In the event of multiple selections we would need to
 * construct the instance set from multiple sources.
 *
 * If we are performing graphical selection operations, we may be either
 * refining a set by selecting objects to be removed from it, or selecting
 * objects not already part of the set to add to it.  In either case we will be
 * operating at the individual instance level, and must provide ways to allow
 * the user to refine their selection intent for editing purposes.
 *
 * If we want to (say) set all non-active objects to be highly transparent when
 * an editing operation commences, we will also need to be able to construct the
 * set of all scene objects which are NOT active in the currently processed set.
 *
 * If we want to edit primitive parameters, rather than comb instances, we will
 * need to boil down a set of selected comb instances to one or a set of solid
 * names.  (Usually a set count > 1 won't work for primitive editing if we have
 * multiple different independent solid leaf objects... in that case we may
 * want to just reject an attempt to solid edit...)  Given the solid, we will
 * then need to extract the set of all drawn instances of that solid from the
 * scene, so we can generate and update per-instance wireframes for all of them
 * to visually reflect the impact of the edit (MGED's inability to do this is
 * why solid editing is rejected if more than one instance of the object is
 * drawn in the scene - we don't want that limitation.)
