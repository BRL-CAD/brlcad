/** @file libged/joint.h
 *
 * Joint and constraint information.
 *
 * A joint has to contain all the information to describe how two
 * segments move in relationship to each other.
 *
 * The two segments are defined by the arc given.  The upper arc
 * is the fixed part, the lower part is the "moving" part.  The arc
 * can be completely rooted or a partial description.
 *
 * In the simplest case, a joint moves in only one direction (1 degree of
 * freedom) For rotations, this can be described completely as a
 * quaternion.  For a slider, this can be described completely as a unit
 * vector.
 *
 * For two degrees of freedom, Two quaternions describe rotation one then
 * rotation two.  (Math: The two quaternions can be added "?" to make
 * a new quaternion that represents the movement around both axis) For
 * sliders, two unit vectors and a starting point define the plane used.
 *
 * For three degrees of freedom, three quaternions or three unit vectors.
 *
 * The reason we use the three unit vectors rather than the more usual
 * normal and closest point, is that we can then use a simple parametric
 * statement of how to move.  It would be best that the two vectors be
 * at right angles to each other, but that is not required.
 *
 * This use of unit vectors allows for non-axis aligned movements, it allows
 * for non-square and non-cube movement.
 *
 * Each degree of freedom contains both an upper and lower bound as well
 * as the current value of the joint.  If upper < lower then this degree
 * of freedom is not used.
