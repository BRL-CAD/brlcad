.SH NAME
search \- find and list objects in a \fBBRL-CAD\fP database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B search
[ path ]
[ options ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I search
works in a fashion similar to Unix-style find commands (internally it
is based on OpenBSD's and NetBSD's find code) but searches
.I objects
in the current open database in MGED rather than files in a
file system.  By default, the output is a list of matches printed
in the MGED command window, but other output options are available.
Matching of objects is done according to boolean expressions formed
using the
.B PRIMITIVES
and
.B OPERATORS
described below.
.LP
.SH PRIMITIVES:
.TP
.B attr attrib[=val]
Returns TRUE if the object has attribute
.I attrib.
If a specific value is also supplied for the attribute,
TRUE is returned if the object both has the attribute and
the attribute is set to value
.I val.
Both
.I attrib
and
.I val
are treated as patterns under shell pattern matching rules.
.TP
.B empty 
Returns TRUE if the object is a combination and has no tree below it.
.TP
.B iname pattern 
Like
.B name
except the match is case insensitive.
.TP
.B iregex pattern
Like
.B regex
except the match is case insensitive.
.TP
.B maxdepth n
True if the depth of the object in the tree is less than
or equal to
.I n.
.TP
.B mindepth n
True if the depth of the object in the gree is greater than
or equal to
.I n.
.TP
.B name pattern
True if the object name (not the full path, just the name) matches
.I pattern.
The evaluation is done according to shell pattern matching rules.
.TP
.B path pattern
True if the object path matches
.I pattern.
The evaluation is done according to shell pattern matching rules.
.TP
.B print 
Evaluates to TRUE - used to print out the path and name of the object.
.TP
.B print0 
Evaluates to TRUE - prints the pathname of the object to standard output, followed by an ASCII NUL character.
.TP
.B regex pattern
True if the object path matches
.I pattern.
Pattern evaluation is done using Regular Expression matching.
.TP
.B stdattr 
Returns TRUE if an object has ONLY standard attributes associated with it.  Standard attributes in BRL-CAD are:
.br
 
.br
.ta 1.5i
.br
aircode      GIFTmater      inherit
.br
los          material_id    oshader
.br
region       region_id      rgb
.br
 
.br
.TP
.B type pattern
Returns TRUE if the type of the object matches
.I pattern.
Pattern evaluation is done using shell pattern matching.  Types
recognized include:
.br
 
.br
.ta 1.5i

.SH OPERATORS
.TP
.B ( expression )
Evaluates to true if the expression inside the parenthesies evaluates to true.
Used to establish order of operations.
.TP
.B -above expression
The above operator applies the expression to every object above the current
object in the full path to that object, and returns TRUE if one or more of
them satisfies the expression - e.g -above -name s\* applied to
/component/region.r/start_comb.c/prim1.s would return TRUE for /component and 
/component/region.r as both being "above" start_comb.c, but would return FALSE
the deeper objects.
.TP
.B expression -and expression  (a.k.a -a)
The and operator operates like the logical AND operator - TRUE only if both
expressions are true.  AND is the default
operator assumed if two expressions are present with no operator explicitly
defined.
.TP
.B -below expression
The below operator applies the expression to every object below the current
object in the tree hierarchy - in effect it does a "mini-search" of the tree
using the current object path as a starting point and returns TRUE if the
expression is satisfied by one or more objects in the sub-tree.
.TP
.B -not expression (a.k.a -!)
The logical NOT operator - returns the opposite of the evaluation result of
expression.
.TP
.B expression -or expression (a.k.a -o)
The logical OR operator - true if either expression is true.

.SH A Note on Expressions
All primaries and operands must be expressed as separate arguments to search.
In practice, this means that there must be a space between each element in a
search expression.  E.g. !(-name [a-z] -or -name [0-9]) must be written as:
.LP
! ( -name [a-z] -or -name [0-9] )
.LP
While this may seem like a rather verbose way of writing the expression, it greatly
simplifies the parsing of the expression and is standard for virtually all
.B find
type commands. Because [a-z] and [0-9] are atomic arguments as far as search is concerned, they should NOT be expanded in a similar fashion.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following are run from the MGED command prompt:
.TP
search -name *.s
Find all instances of objects in the database with names ending in ".s"
.TP
search -name *.s -mindepth 3
Find all instances of objects in the database with names ending in ".s"
that are 3 or more levels deep in their tree.
.TP
search . -type eto
Find all objects in the database that are elliptical tori.  Notice the
use of "." for the path, which means to find the objects themselves in
a flat search rather than all instances in the tree hierarchy.
.TP
search -type comb -not ( -type region -or -type assem )
Find all instances of combinations that are not regions and do not contain regions.
.TP
search -below -type region -type region
Find all instances of objects of type region that contain a region in the
subtree.  This searches for regions being used "below" other regions, which
is considered bad practice in BRL-CAD
.TP
search -below -type region -type combination ! -type region
Find all instances of objects of type combination that contain regions but are
not themselves regions.  These are regarded as "assemblies" in BRL-CAD.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Errors will be returned if parsing of the arguments fails, or one of the primaries's
evaluation functions returns an error.
