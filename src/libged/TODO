* 'about' command to display version, contents of various doc files,
  customizable brlcad.msg file

* 'align' command taking a from 3d pt and a to 3d pt target.
  moves/rotates the source object into alignment.

* a "batch" command for libged to apply a given command template to
  all lines in a given input text file.  could be very similar to exec
  but instead of inspecting the current .g, it walks lines in file(s).
  this would let you do things like:

  # same as mvall -f file.txt
  batch file.txt -exec "mvall \$*"

  # create an alternate hierarchy based on some mapping file
  batch file.txt -exec "g \$*"

  # for all lines in 3 files, kill first symbol, rename second to it
  batch A.txt B.txt C.txt -exec "kill \$1" -exec "mv \$2 \$1"

  # keep all objects in an edcodes file with region ID > 1000
  batch A.txt -field 2 -ne 1000 -exec "keep subset.g \$5"

  # for all regions, if they are listed in file.txt, add them to a
  # parent assembly and set a specified material ID
  search . -name "*.r" -exec batch file.txt -field 1 -eq {} -exec "g \$1 {}" -exec "mater {} \$3" \;

  # run awk, get 4th column, run sed to change name,
  batch file.txt -awk '{print $4}' -sed 's/^r\.(.*)/\1\.r/g' -exec "mv \$1 \$$"

  # outside of MGED, the above would have been similar to:
  cat file.txt | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/^r\.(.*)/r\.\1 \1\.r/g' | xargs mged test.g mv

  The command becomes more of a stream processor on the input file, as
  if piped on the shell line.  To embed awk, sed, cut, see qse:
	  http://code.google.com/p/qse/

  The search and batch commands probably can't nor shouldn't use the
  same replacement markers, with batch using $*, $1, $2, etc., to
  represent file columns (in a poor man's awk fashion) and search
  simply using "{}" as the object name replacement marker.

* implement new 'reduce' command to perform model reduction.  should
  perform automatic simplification of geometry to reduce complexity by
  (potentially) orders of magnitude.  this is level of detail for
  non-viewing purposes, for export.  possibly automatable by replacing
  leave-node geometry with bounding box (arb8s), but collapsing and
  combining up the hierarchy to a prescribed tree depth.  however, it
  model includes BoTs/NURBS, more advanced spatial logic will be
  needed.

* implement a "select" command in LIBGED that creates a selection set
  based on specified sampling parameters or object lists.  example
  could be "select -point 12.3 23.1 31.2 -dist 100.0" to
  select objects within a given distance of a point; "select foo bar"
  to select specific objects and create/return a temporary reference
  name. this provides a command-line mechanism for implementing band
  selection in the GUI, area-based selections, and object highlighting
	- can replace unpublished 'sphgroup' command with this

* implement a new tool/command that reports summary information about
  a geometry file including number of objects, types of objects,
  classes of geometry representation types used, and potentially more.

* implement a region anointment command where the user can turn an
  assembly into a region and change all lower or higher regions into
  combinations
