These are new command ideas for LIBGED.
Keep them sorted alphabetically.
They are not all vetted.
Be specific.

---

* 'about' command: display version, contents of various doc files,
  customizable brlcad.msg file.  could also report summary information
  about the currently displayed geometry (possibly as a 'stats'
  command alternatively).  this would include the number of objects,
  types of objects, triangle counts, surface counts, extents, classes
  of geometry representation types used, and potentially more.
  options to disable version or object info.  consider merging with
  'summary' command.  provide option for writing results out to a
  file.

* 'align' command: taking a from 3d pt and a to 3d pt target.
  moves/rotates the source object into alignment.

* 'audit' command: determine if the model is valid, provide option(s)
  to fix any errors encountered.  this could be a refactoring or
  calling of g_lint and/or other tools.

* 'array' command: to create a shallow copy of geometry in a
  rectangular or polar pattern.  similar to clone, perhaps mergable
  with clone as an option.  takes #rows+dist and #cols+dist, or
  centerpt+#items and angle <360 to fill, angle between items, rotate
  each item boolean.

* 'batch' command: apply a given command template to all lines in a
  given input text file.  could be very similar to exec but instead of
  inspecting the current .g, it walks lines in file(s).  this would
  let you do things like:

  # same as mvall -f file.txt
  batch file.txt -exec "mvall {*}"

  # create an alternate hierarchy based on some mapping file
  batch -m line file.txt -exec "g {line}"

  # for all lines in 3 files, kill first symbol, rename second to it
  batch A.txt B.txt C.txt -exec "kill {1}" -exec "mv {2} {1}"

  # keep all objects in an edcodes file with region ID > 1000
  batch A.txt -field 2 -ne 1000 -exec "keep subset.g {5}"

  # for all regions, if they are listed in file.txt, add them to a
  # parent assembly and set a specified material ID
  search . -name "*.r" -exec batch -m line file.txt -field 1 -eq {} -exec "g {1} {}" -exec "mater {} {3}" ;

  # run awk, get 4th column, run sed to change name from r123 to 123.r,
  batch file.txt -awk '{print $4}' -sed 's/^r(.*)/\1\.r/g' -exec "mv {1} {$}"

  # outside of MGED, the above would have been similar to:
  cat file.txt | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/^r(.*)/r\1 \1\.r/g' | xargs mged test.g mv

  The command becomes more of a stream processor on the input file, as
  if piped on the shell line.  To embed awk, sed, cut, see qse:
	  http://code.google.com/p/qse/

  Batch needs some syntax like $*, $1, $2, or {*}, {1}, {2}, etc., to
  represent file columns (in a poor man's awk fashion) and search
  simply using "{}" as the object name replacement marker (unless we
  specify a -m {marker_name}).  Using the same positional markers will
  help keep the interface consistent for the user, but it will require
  forethought on how batch interfacts with the search and repeat
  commands.

* 'cal' command: geometry calculator for scalar values, points,
  vectors, and maybe matrices.  units aware with options for
  converting between units, angles, with support for std funcs like
  sin, cos, log, abs.  also supporting view values, points on a line,
  normals, distances, ... powerful calculator for those places where
  the user needs some value we don't display for them (like needing to
  calculate a distance between two nirt rays, or something that always
  prints mm, or a command that print radians instead of degrees).

* 'compile' command: evaluate and cache results of geometry
  computations for improved performance.  this could be a variety of
  cache-worthy actions such as wireframes at given levels of detail,
  raytrace prep results, default tessellations, simple geometry
  validation (see 'audit' command), or shape analysis (surface area,
  volume, moments of inertia, etc).

* 'menu' command: to load/unload menu descriptions from a file
  (e.g. file.mnu) where we bind text, icons, images, descriptions, and
  key bindings to actions.  would serve as a place to move
  existing menu-related commands (e.g., press command becomes
  subcommand) and allow for interface customization.  

* 'redo' command: redoes the previous undone command(s).  Basically
  move forward in an undo chain.  See undo below.

* 'reduce' command: to perform model reduction.  should perform
  automatic simplification of geometry to reduce complexity by
  (potentially) orders of magnitude.  this is level of detail for
  non-viewing purposes, for export.  possibly automatable by replacing
  leave-node geometry with bounding box (arb8s), but collapsing and
  combining up the hierarchy to a prescribed tree depth.  however, it
  model includes BoTs/NURBS, more advanced spatial logic will be
  needed.

# 'render' command: to perform different kinds of rendering.  this may
  simply be a renaming of rtwizard, but the intent would be to make
  sure rt, rtedge, and rtwizard are encapsulated under one simplified
  command.  options for quick preview and full-detail rendering,
  without or with shaders, in color or B&W.

* 'repeat' command: perform an action multiple times.  this is similar
  to the search -exec option but instead of being limited to object
  substitutions, it lets you run the same action with any
  substitution.  it's basically a for loop construct over one command.

  # create a bunch of spheres
  repeat 1 2 3 -exec make sph sph.{}

  # create 9 objects
  repeat -m obj sph arb8 tor -exec "repeat -m cnt 1 2 3 -exec \"make {obj} {obj}.{cnt}\""

  # create 3 separate tessellations of an object
  repeat 0.1 0.01 0.001 -exec "tol abs {}" -exec "facetize sph.bot sph"

  Need to make sure that the repeat, search, and batch commands all
  have consistent/compatible marker syntax.  Also need to consider
  arguments or objects with '-' at the beginning of the name and how
  argv processing will be handled.

* 'select' command: creates a selection set based on specified
  sampling parameters or object lists.  Should also provide a basic
  command-line mechanism for implementing band selection based on
  current view, volume-based selections, and object highlighting.
  Would encapsulate or replace the unpublished 'sphgroup' command.
  Some examples:

  # select objects within a given distance from a 3d point
  select -point 12.3 23.1 31.2 -dist 100.0

  # select two objects,  create/return a temporary reference name
  select foo bar

* 'text' command: imports a text file (as geometry).  have options to
  specify the spacing between lines, first line, #lines,
  underline/overline each line, convert to all upper/lower, position.
  probably best to create either a 'plot' or 'annotation' object
  (described in top-level TODO).  need some convention for symbols,
  degree, +-tol, null diam, etc.

* 'undo' command: undo the previous command or previous N commands.
  Should be stored as a chain or tree of events so you can cycle
  forwards or backwards vim/emacs style.  See redo command above.
