These are new command ideas for LIBGED.
Keep them sorted alphabetically.
They are not all vetted.
Be specific.

---

* 'about' command: display version, contents of various doc files,
  customizable brlcad.msg file.  should also report summary
  information about the currently displayed geometry including number
  of objects, types of objects, classes of geometry representation
  types used, and potentially more.  options to disable version or
  object info.  consider merging with 'summary' command.

* 'align' command: taking a from 3d pt and a to 3d pt target.
  moves/rotates the source object into alignment.

* 'audit' command: determine if the model is valid, provide option(s)
  to fix any errors encountered.  this could be a refactoring or
  calling of g_lint and/or other tools.

* 'array' command: to create a shallow copy of geometry in a
  rectangular or polar pattern.  similar to clone, perhaps mergable
  with clone as an option.  takes #rows+dist and #cols+dist, or
  centerpt+#items and angle <360 to fill, angle between items, rotate
  each item boolean.

* 'batch' command: apply a given command template to all lines in a
  given input text file.  could be very similar to exec but instead of
  inspecting the current .g, it walks lines in file(s).  this would
  let you do things like:

  # same as mvall -f file.txt
  batch file.txt -exec "mvall \$*"

  # create an alternate hierarchy based on some mapping file
  batch file.txt -exec "g \$*"

  # for all lines in 3 files, kill first symbol, rename second to it
  batch A.txt B.txt C.txt -exec "kill \$1" -exec "mv \$2 \$1"

  # keep all objects in an edcodes file with region ID > 1000
  batch A.txt -field 2 -ne 1000 -exec "keep subset.g \$5"

  # for all regions, if they are listed in file.txt, add them to a
  # parent assembly and set a specified material ID
  search . -name "*.r" -exec batch file.txt -field 1 -eq {} -exec "g \$1 {}" -exec "mater {} \$3" \;

  # run awk, get 4th column, run sed to change name,
  batch file.txt -awk '{print $4}' -sed 's/^r\.(.*)/\1\.r/g' -exec "mv \$1 \$$"

  # outside of MGED, the above would have been similar to:
  cat file.txt | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/^r\.(.*)/r\.\1 \1\.r/g' | xargs mged test.g mv

  The command becomes more of a stream processor on the input file, as
  if piped on the shell line.  To embed awk, sed, cut, see qse:
	  http://code.google.com/p/qse/

  The search and batch commands probably can't nor shouldn't use the
  same replacement markers, with batch using $*, $1, $2, etc., to
  represent file columns (in a poor man's awk fashion) and search
  simply using "{}" as the object name replacement marker.

* 'reduce' command: to perform model reduction.  should perform
  automatic simplification of geometry to reduce complexity by
  (potentially) orders of magnitude.  this is level of detail for
  non-viewing purposes, for export.  possibly automatable by replacing
  leave-node geometry with bounding box (arb8s), but collapsing and
  combining up the hierarchy to a prescribed tree depth.  however, it
  model includes BoTs/NURBS, more advanced spatial logic will be
  needed.

* 'select' command: creates a selection set based on specified
  sampling parameters or object lists.  example could be "select
  -point 12.3 23.1 31.2 -dist 100.0" to select objects within a given
  distance of a point; "select foo bar" to select specific objects and
  create/return a temporary reference name. this provides a
  command-line mechanism for implementing band selection in the GUI,
  area-based selections, and object highlighting - can replace
  unpublished 'sphgroup' command with this

* 'text' command: imports a text file (as geometry).  have options to
  specify the spacing between lines, first line, #lines,
  underline/overline each line, convert to all upper/lower, position.
  probably best to create either a 'plot' or 'annotation' object
  (described in top-level TODO).
