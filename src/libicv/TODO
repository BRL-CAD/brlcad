LIBICV To Do List
==================

* Add fileformats for bmp, rle, mac, ps(?), sun, spm, and yuv type
  images.

* Check that the icv tool is able to exactly reproduce the outputs
  of the various fmt-fmt image conversion tools.  This is a
  necessary precursor to deprecating those tools in favor of a
  single icv tool.

* FIX fixed size buffers in fileformat.c.

* Make each file format a modular extension to the library (organized
  as one file or one directory per format).

* Support dynamically loading formats (e.g., define a plug-in API).

TODO items should be formatted to column 70 (M-q in emacs), no tabs.
