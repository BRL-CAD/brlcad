/** @file dynamic_geometry.c
 *
 * Library for dynamically changing BRL-CAD geometry (i.e., changing
 * already prepped geometry)
 *
 * The typical use of dynamic geometry involves these steps:
 *
 * 1. Normal use of " db_dirbuild", "gettrees", and "prep".
 *
 * 2. Call "wdb_dbopen" to get a "struct rt_wdb" pointer for the
 * database (typically using the RT_WDB_TYPE_DB_INMEM flag)
 *
 * 3. Create and fill an "rt_reprep_obj_list" structure.
 *
 * 4. Call "rt_unprep" and pass it the "rt_reprep_obj_list" structure.
 *
 * 5. Modify geometry (note, you may only modify geometry that you
 * listed in the "rt_reprep_obj_list" as "unprepped"). You may add,
 * remove, modify, translate, rotate, scale objects under the
 * "unprepped" combinations. (Use the "make_hole" routine here).
 *
 * 6. Call "rt_reprep" with same parameters as you called "rt_unprep".
 *
 * 7. If you are using liboptical, call "view_re_setup" to setup
 * shaders for regions involved.
 *
 * 8. Do raytracing.
 *
 * If you only need to make holes, a simpler and quicker approach is
 * to use the "make_hole_in_prepped_regions" routine:
 *
 * Steps 1 and 2 are the same as above, then 3. Call "make_hole" and
 * 4. Do raytracing.

/**
 * M A K E _ H O L E
 *
 * This routine is intended to be used to make a hole in some
 * geometry.  The hole is described using the same parameters as an
 * RCC, and the hole is represented as an RCC. The objects to be
 * "holed" are passed in as a list of "struct directory" pointers. The
 * objects pointed at by this list must be combinations. The "struct
 * rt_wdb" pointer passed in indicates what model this hole should
 * appear in.
 *
 * The end state after this routine runs is a modified model with a
 * new RCC primitive having a name of the form "make_hole_X" (where X
 * is some integer). The combinations specified in the list will be
 * modified as follows:
 *
 *	      before					      after
 *		|						-
 *		|					       / \
 *		|					      /   \
 *	original combination tree			     /     \
 *				      original combination tree   make_hole_X
 *
 * The modified combination is written to the struct rt_wdb. Note that
 * to do dynamic geometry a "wdb_dbopen" would normally be called on
 * an already existing (and possibly prepped) model.  Using the
 * RT_WDB_TYPE_DB_INMEM parameter in this call will result in geometry
 * changes that only exist in memory and will not be permanently
 * stored in the original database.
 *
 * This routine should be preceeded by a call to "rt_unprep" and
 * followed by a call to "rt_reprep".

 * existing prepped geometry.  The geometry must already be prepped
 * prior to caling this routine. After calling this routine, the
 * geometry is ready for raytracing (no other routine need to be
 * called).
 *
 * A new RCC primitive is created and written to the database
 * (wdbp). Note that this will be temporary if the wdbp pointer was
 * created by a call to wdb_dbopen with the RT_WDB_TYPE_DB_INMEM flag.
 *
 * The "regions" parameter is a list of "struct region" pointers
 * (prepped regions) to get holed.  The regions structures are
 * modified, but the on disk region records are never modified, so the
 * actual holes will never be permanent regardless of how "wdbp" was
 * opened.
 *
 * There is no need to call "rt_unprep" nor "rt_reprep" with this
 * routine.
