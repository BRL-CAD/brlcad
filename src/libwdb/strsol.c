/** @file strsol.c
 *
 *  Library for writing strsol solids to MGED databases.
 *  Assumes that some of the structure of such databases are known
 *  by the calling routines.
 *
 *
 *  Note that routines which are passed point_t or vect_t or mat_t
 *  parameters (which are call-by-address) must be VERY careful to
 *  leave those parameters unmodified (eg, by scaling), so that the
 *  calling routine is not surprised.
 *
 *  Return codes of 0 are OK, -1 signal an error.
