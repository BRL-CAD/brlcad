/** @file rt/rtexample.c
 *
 * This is a heavily commented example of a program that uses librt to
 * shoot a single ray at some geometry in a .g database.
 *
 * The primary BRL-CAD ray-tracing API consists of calls to the
 * function rt_shootray().  This function takes a single argument, the
 * address of a data structure called the "application" structure.
 * This data structure contains crucial information, such as the
 * origin and direction of the ray to be traced, what to do if the ray
 * hits geometry, or what to do if it misses everything.  While the
 * application struct is a large and somewhat complex looking, (it is
 * defined in the raytrace.h header) there are really very few items
 * in it which the application programmer must know about. These are:
 *
 *   a_rt_i	The "raytrace instance" obtained via rt_dirbuild()
 *   a_ray	The ray origin and direction to be shot
 *   a_hit	A callback function for when the ray encounters geometry
 *   a_miss	A callback function for when the ray misses everything
 *
 * Most of the work an application performs will be done in the "hit"
 * routine.  This user-supplied routine gets called deep inside the
 * raytracing library via the rt_shootray() function.  It is provided
 * with 3 parameters:
 *
 *   ap		Pointer to the application structure passed to rt_shootray()
 *   PartHeadp	List of ray "partitions" which represent geometry hit
 *   segp	List of ray "segments" that comprised partitions
 *
 * Most applications can ignore the last parameter.  The PartHeadp
 * parameter is a linked-list of "partition" structures (defined in
 * the raytrace.h header).  It is the job of the "hit" routine to
 * process these ray/object intersections to do the work of the
 * application.
 *
 * This file is part of the default compile in source distributions of
 * BRL-CAD and is usually installed or provided via binary and source
 * distributions.  To compile this example from a binary install:
 *
 * cc -I/usr/brlcad/include/brlcad -L/usr/brlcad/lib -o rtexample rtexample.c -lbu -lrt -lm
