/*****************************************************************
 * TAG( rle_raw_alloc )
 *
 * Allocate buffer space for use by rle_getraw and rle_putraw.
 * Inputs:
 * 	the_hdr:	Header structure for RLE file to be read or
 *			written.
 * Outputs:
 *	scanp:		Pointer to pointer to created opcode buffer.
 * 	nrawp:		Pointer to pointer to created length buffer.
 *			These pointers are adjusted for the alpha channel,
 *			if present.
 *	Returns 0 for success, -1 if malloc failed.
 * Assumptions:
 * 	Since buffers are built to have as many slots as there are pixels
 *	in the input scanline, it is assumed that no input scanline will
 *	have more data elements than this.
 * Algorithm:
 *	Count number of channels actually used (check bitmap).
 * 	Allocate nchan*rowlength elements, allocate a buffer
 *	to hold (ncolors+alpha) pointers.
 *	Also allocate a buffer of ncolors+alpha
 *	integers for the length buffer.
