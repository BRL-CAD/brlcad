 * TAG( rle_cp )
 *
 * Copy the image described by in_hdr to that described by out_hdr
 * until an end-of-image is encountered.
 *
 * Replaces the fread/fwrite loop used that was before we were
 * concerned with concatenated images.
 *
 * Inputs:
 * 	in_hdr:		Describes input image.
 * Outputs:
 * 	out_hdr:	Describes output image.
 * Assumptions:
 * 	rle_get_setup/rle_put_setup have been called.
 * 	in_hdr and out_hdr are compatible -- same number of channels,
 * 	same size, all relevant channel bits set.
 * 	The scanline most recently read from the input has been
 * 	written to the output.
 * Algorithm:
 * 	Minimal processing is done.  Each opcode is recognized to the
 * 	extent necessary to copy it and its data to the output.
