	* itk/generic/itk_archetype.c:
	Now builds with 8.3 regarding CONST84 trims on some Tcl API calls.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_cmds.c:
	* itk/generic/itk_cmds.c:
	Because the Tcl_Namespace APIs in Tcl have moved to the public
	space in 8.5, the stub slots have shifted.  This now causes Itcl
	when built against 8.5 to core when loaded into 8.4.  What genius
	you developers!  The absolute first rule with Stubs is not to EVER
	move the slots, but now you did.  Previously, one could build Itcl
	against 8.4 and load into any core 8.1+.  Now we can't do this.
	Gee, thank you all for the support...

	Now, what we compile against is the lowest we can load
	into.. Sorry!  send heated complaints to tcl-core@lists.sf.net

2003-12-17  davygrvy

	Use fancy STRINGIFY macros for version string.

	* itk/configure:
	* itk/configure.in:
	Changed to propagate an initial CFLAGS value
	to the final definition. A TEA condition (SHARED_BUILD == 1)
	squashed it, causing it the build system to loose the
	+DAportable we specify for the AS PA-RISC2.2 build host. This is
	a problem for _all_ TEA and TEA 2 based configure files.

2002-10-15  hobbs
	* itcl/configure:    move the CFLAGS definition into

	Itk_CreateArchComponent, Itk_DelArchComponent): Save a copy
	of the window path name in the ArchComponent struct and use
	it in the Itk_ArchCompDeleteCmd method. The old code was
	invoking Tk_PathName(tkwin) on a Tk_Window which lead to
	a memory access on memory that has already been free'd

	* itk/Makefile.in (install-lib-binaries): ensure that dynamic
	library is installed executable

	* itcl/configure:
	* itcl/configure.in:
	* itk/configure:
	* itk/configure.in: redid generation of itclConfig.sh (making it
	work on Windows broke Unix).  Retested so that it is happy on
	Windows and Unix (calls ${CYGPATH} only when necessary).

2002-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* */configure: regenerated
	* tcl.m4: updated from sample changes

	* config/installFile.tcl (removed):
	* config/mkinstalldirs (removed): Massive overhaul (and
	simplification) of the build framework to adapt to TEA 2002
	specs.  Dynamic libraries now install in the pkglibdir (before it
	was libdir), itclConfig.sh is properly generated and itk uses it.
	Stubs libraries are now correctly generated and used.  You can now
	build and test itcl/itk against built but not installed Tcl/Tk.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_cmds.c (Itcl_FindObjectsCmd, Itcl_FindClassesCmd):
	optimized use of Tcl_Objs to remove the creation of new ones that ended
	just being set to the interp's result.  Let it use the result obj
	instead.  Changed a few Tcl_GetStringFromObj() calls to Tcl_GetString()

	Removing of old cruft.  itkwishXX.exe is no longer needed as
	itkXX.dll is a pure extension and loads in a vanilla wish just
	fine.

	* itcl/win/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* itk/win/pkgIndex.tcl:
	we'll auto gen these from the makefile

	* itcl/win/makefile.vc:
	* itk/win/makefile.vc:
	fixed include paths to make sure paths to itcl.h and itk.h in the
	source tree are mentioned first to avoid a possible bug during
	building.

	* itcl/configure:
	* itcl/configure.in:
	* itk/configure:
	* itk/configure.in:
	patch #426203

	* itk/win/makefile.vc:
	Mostly working.  Not fully tested, but lots closer.

	* itk/win/makefile.vc:
	more closer, but not yet perfect.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_cmds.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_methods.c:
	Fix for Tcl_GetCommandName() now returning a CONST char *
	from the changes Kevein Kenny is doing to the HEAD tcl code.
	This hasn't been tested with older header files, yet.

	* itk/generic/itk_cmds.c:
	Removed old reference to external ItkStubs structure.
	Old cruft left from before Itk_InitStubs existed.

	* itcl/win/itcl.rc:
	* itcl/win/rc/itcl.rc:
	moving the resource script

	* itcl/win/rc/itcl.rc:
	subtle changes.

	* itcl/win/itclsh.rc:
	* itcl/win/tclAppInit.c:
	Removing of old cruft.  itclshXX.exe is no longer needed as
	itclXX.dll is a pure extension and loads in a vanilla shell just
	fine.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_methods.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_util.c:
	removed #include "tclCompile.h"!  It wasn't needed.  Those source
	files made no reference to anything in it.

	* itk/win/makefile.vc:
	closer to perfection.

	* itk/win/rc/itk.rc:
	This is now the resource script for the dll.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_methods.c:
	whoops.. doh!

	* itk/win/dllEntryPoint.c:
	Stubs bug logic fix.  Same as itcl/win/dllEntryPoint.c.  This help
	build a debug version of itcl/itk from the standard tclstubXX.lib
	by removing the link requirement to msvcrt.lib which should never
	have been there.

	* itcl/win/makefile.vc:
	adapted for new location of itcl.rc

	* itk/win/rc/itk.rc:
	subtle changes to infere the correct filename and support more
	complete versioning info.

	* itcl/generic/itcl.h:
	* itk/generic/itk.h:
	changed RESOURCE_INCLUDED to RC_INVOKED. The windows resource
	compiler to preset to define this already.

	* itcl/generic/itclInt.decls:
	* itcl/generic/itclIntDecls.h:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_class.c:
	Fix for Itcl_ClassCmdResolver() not being of type
	Tcl_ResolveCmdProc with the CONST type added to param 2 in the
	lastest headers.  I haven't tested this with an older tcl.h yet.
	Hopefully, this won't get messy.

	* itcl/win/makefile.vc:
	small $(RCDIR) change.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_bicmds.c:
	patch #426207, contextNs ptr can be NULL in Itcl_BiInfoClassCmd

2001-05-18  andreas_kupries
	* itcl/generic/itcl_class.c:
	[Fix 227811] Check for any command with the given name, not only
	objects.

2001-05-17  andreas_kupries
	* itcl/generic/itcl_class.c:

	duplicates).

	* itk/generic/itk_archetype.c: Fixed bug 227814

2001-04-25  davygrvy
	* pkg.vc: moved the info about the iwidget version for makefile.vc

2001-04-18  davygrvy
	* itcl/win/dllEntryPoint.c:
	whoops...  removed C++ style comment from this .c file :)

2001-04-14  davygrvy

	* itcl/library/itcl.tcl: Patch ID #227860

	* rules.vc: added an rcs keyword

	* .cvsignore: just testing loginfo mailing...

	* .cvsignore: only making a change to see the history file get an
	entry...

2001-04-12  davygrvy
	* itcl/win/makefile.vc: progress is happening

2001-04-08  davygrvy
	* itcl/win/.cvsignore:
	* itk/win/.cvsignore:
	no need to have CVS bother itself with the build directories

	* itcl/win/makefile.vc:
	a large rewrite

	* makefile.vc:
	todays work progress.  I'm not done yet.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_ensemble.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_util.c:
	Added mutex locking around the ItclPreservedList global hash table.  This
	appears to be the only work needed to support multithreading.

	* config.vc:
	* pkg.vc:
	* rules.vc:
	new build files for VC++ compiles

	* .cvsignore:
	ignore MSVC++ project artifacts

2001-04-07  davygrvy
	* itcl/win/dllEntryPoint.c:
	a small windows specific fix against Tcl's Stubs library.

	* itcl/generic/itclInt.h:
	* itcl/generic/itclStubLib.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_class.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_cmds.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_ensemble.c:
	  Tcl's internal header, tclInt.h, in 8.4a2 got a small change in
	  the Command structure that needed 2 changes in Itcl to resolve.
	  1) #if/#else/#endif blocks added in itcl_class.c and
	  itc_ensemble.c allowing Itcl to compile. 2) added a global
	  variable called itclCompatFlags that's sets a flag in
	  Itcl_Init() that will modify the logic around access to
	  cmdPtr->flags/deleted.  This way, any core compile will yeild a
	  fully forward/backward compatible binary (correct logic set at
	  runtime).

2000-12-21  smithc
	* itk/win/makefile.vc: Patch #102914.

2000-12-12  smithc
	* itcl/generic/itcl_ensemble.c: Patch #102774

	* itcl/generic/itcl_class.c: Patch #100274

2000-09-23  davidg
	* CHANGES: added a note about the 3.2 release

	* itcl/generic/itcl.h:
	  Itcl_InitStub prototype in itcl/generic/itcl.h was getting name
	  mangled by c++ compilers.  Fixed with an 'extern "C"'
	  appropriately applied.

2000-08-18  davidg
	* itcl/generic/itcl_cmds.c:
	Tcl_InitStubs was using the TCL_VERSION macro set by the
	tcl.h header.  Changed it to be "8.1" instead as it
	doesn't matter unless Itcl needs special/new features of
	the core it's header is from.  But it doesn't..  so hard
	code it for an 8.1 minimum.

2000-08-07  welch
	* itcl/Makefile.in:
	* itcl/generic/itcl.h:
	* itcl/generic/itclStubLib.c:
	Final iteration, really, on getting Itcl_StubInit
	correctly set up.

	* itk/generic/itk_cmds.c:
	Removed redundant definitions of itclStubsPtr and
	itclIntStubsPtr.

	* itcl/Makefile.in:
	Added Itcl_InitStubs to the main Itcl library as well as
	the stubs library for those applications (like Itk) that
	call Itcl_InitStub but are linked against the main
	library.

2000-08-04  davidg
	* itcl/generic/itcl.decls:
	* itcl/generic/itclDecls.h:
	* itcl/generic/itclIntDecls.h:

	* itcl/generic/itcl.h:
	* itcl/generic/itclStubLib.c:
	* itk/generic/itk.h:
	* itk/generic/itkStubLib.c:
	yanked ugly linkage cruft from the StubLib functions.  It's
	always static.

2000-08-02  davidg
	* itk/generic/itk_cmds.c:
	simplified how Itcl Stubs are set

	* itcl/generic/itcl.h:
	* itk/generic/itk.h:
	added missing Itcl_InitStubs and Itk_InitStubs declarations.

2000-08-02  welch
	* itk/generic/itkStubLib.c:
	Fixed this new function

	* itcl/Makefile.in:
	* itk/Makefile.in:
	Changed this to use installFiles.tcl instead of install-sh

	* itcl/generic/itclStubLib.c:
	Fix for new Itcl_InitStubs.c

	* config/installFile.tcl:
	Added a Tcl version of install-sh that avoids copying a
	file if the target has the same size and date stamp as the
	source file already.  This helps parallel builds on
	different platforms avoid changing files out from one
	another.

2000-07-29  welch
	* itcl/configure:
	* itk/configure: Ran autoconf

	* tcl.m4: Fixed this with respect to recent changes in windows def
	of TCL_SRC_DIR

2000-07-23  wart
	* itcl/Makefile.in:
	* itk/Makefile.in: Use INSTALL_PROGRAM instead of INSTALL_DATA to
	install libraries so they get execute permission on HPUX

2000-07-14  welch
	* itcl/configure:
	* itk/configure: Updated configure

	* config/install-sh: Nuked debug echo statement

2000-07-12  welch

	* Makefile.in:
	* README:
	Touched up README for itcl3.2 release.  Fixed master Makefile to
	avoid testing iwidgets2.2.0, which is an older release provided
	only for backward-compatibility.  Bug fixes and improvements are
	made and tested in the newer iwidgets3.0.0 release.

	6/26/00 (bug fix)
	  Fixed Itcl_ClassVarResolver so that the formal
	  parameters in a method/proc take precedence over class
	  data members.
	
	6/30/00 (bug fix)
	  Fixed all itcl/itk/iwidgets3.0.0 tests to run cleanly
	  with the new tcltest package.
	
	7/1/00 (bug fix)
	  Fixed "itk_component delete" so that the composite
	  option list is cleaned up whenever a component is
	  deleted.  For example, suppose a component is the sole
	  contributor of -font.  When that component is removed
	  via "itk_component delete", the -font option goes away
	  as well.  Also fixed the handling of the itk-delete-*
	  binding for the component.  When the component is
	  removed, the binding tag is also removed by
	  itk::remove_destroy_hook.
	
	7/5/00 (bug fix)
	  Fixed the check done during object creation to avoid
	  clobbering existing commands.  Previously, itcl would
	  look for any command-- in the local *and* global
	  namespace--that might be clobbered.  Now, it looks for
	  commands only in the local namespace, since those are
	  the only ones that could truly be clobbered.
	
	7/5/00 (cleanup)
	  Removed obsolete Makefile/configure files in the various
	  "unix" directories.  Makefiles and configure files now
	  reside one level above, in the standard TEA place.

	* itk/generic/itk_cmds.c: Removed pedantic check for existance of
	"::itk" namespace.  Changed code to conditionally create the
	"::itk" namespace based on whether it already exists or not.
	These changes were necessary to facilitate the wrapper dictating
	where the [incr Tk] libraries are stored in a wrapped application
	via the variable '::itk::library".
