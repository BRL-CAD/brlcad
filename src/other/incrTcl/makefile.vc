#  Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0+ makefile for [Incr Tcl/Tk].
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  This is the main Visual C++ makefile for the Win32 distribution
#  of [incr Tcl/Tk].  This is not the TEA makefile.

You'll need to run vcvars32.bat from Developer Studio, first, to setup^
the environment.  Jump to this line to read the new instructions.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW TO USE this makefile:
#
# 1)  It is now necessary to have MSVCDir set in the environment.  This is used
#     as a check to see if vcvars32.bat had been run prior to running nmake or
#     during the install of Microsoft Developer Studio, MSVCDir had been set
#     globally and the PATH adjusted.  Either way is valid.
#
#     You'll need to run vcvars32.bat contained in the MsDev's vc(98)/bin
#     directory to setup the proper environment, if needed, for your current
#     setup.  This is a needed bootstrap requirement and allows the swapping of
#     different environments to be easier.
#
# 2)  To use the Platform SDK (not expressly needed), run setenv.bat after
#     vcvars32.bat according to the instructions for it.  This can also turn on
#     the 64-bit compiler, if your SDK has it.
#
# 3)  Targets are:
#	release  -- builds the core, the shell. (default)
#	core     -- Only builds the core.
#	all      -- builds everything.
#	test     -- builds and runs the test suite.
#	tktest   -- just builds the binaries for the test suite.
#	install  -- installs the built binaries and libraries to $(INSTALLDIR)
#		    as the root of the install tree.
#	clean    -- removes the contents of $(TMP_DIR)
#	hose     -- removes the contents of $(TMP_DIR) and $(OUT_DIR)
#	genstubs -- rebuilds the Stubs table and support files (dev only).
#	depend   -- Generates an accurate set of source dependancies for this
#		    makefile.  Helpful to avoid problems when the sources are
#		    refreshed and you rebuild, but can "overbuild" when common
#		    headers like tkInt.h just get small changes.
#	winhelp  -- builds the windows .hlp file for Itcl/Itk from the troff man
#		    files.
#
# 4)  Macros usable on the commandline:
#	TCLDIR=<path>
#		Sets the location for where to find the Tcl headers and
#		libraries.  The install point is assumed when not specified.
#		Tk does need the source directory, though.  Tk comes very close
#		to not needing the sources, but does, in fact, require them.
#
#	INSTALLDIR=<path>
#		Sets where to install Tcl from the built binaries.
#		C:\Progra~1\Tcl is assumed when not specified.
#
#	OPTS=static,msvcrt,linkexten,threads,symbols,profile,none
#		Sets special options for the core.  The default is for none.
#		Any combination of the above may be used (comma separated).
#		'none' will over-ride everything to nothing.
#
#		static  =  Builds a static library of the core instead of a
#			   dll.  The shell will be static (and large), as well.
#		msvcrt  =  Effects the static option only to switch it from
#			   using libcmt(d) as the C runtime [by default] to
#			   msvcrt(d). This is useful for static embedding
#			   support.
#		linkexten = Affects the static option only to switch wishXX.exe
#			   to have the dde and reg extension linked inside it.
#		threads =  Turns on full multithreading support.
#		symbols =  Adds symbols for step debugging.
#		profile =  Adds profiling hooks.  Map file is assumed.
#
#	STATS=memdbg,compdbg,none
#		Sets optional memory and bytecode compiler debugging code added
#		to the core.  The default is for none.  Any combination of the
#		above may be used (comma separated).  'none' will over-ride
#		everything to nothing.
#
#		memdbg   = Enables the debugging memory allocator.
#		compdbg  = Enables byte compilation logging.
#
#	MACHINE=(IX86|IA64|ALPHA)
#		Set the machine type used for the compiler, linker, and
#		resource compiler.  This hook is needed to tell the tools
#		when alternate platforms are requested.  IX86 is the default
#		when not specified.
#
#	TMP_DIR=<path>
#	OUT_DIR=<path>
#		Hooks to allow the intermediate and output directories to be
#		changed.  $(OUT_DIR) is assumed to be 
#		$(BINROOT)\(Release|Debug) based on if symbols are requested.
#		$(TMP_DIR) will de $(OUT_DIR)\<buildtype> by default.
#
#	TESTPAT=<file>
#		Reads the tests requested to be run from this file.
#
# 5)  Examples:
#
#	Basic syntax of calling nmake looks like this:
#	nmake [-nologo] -f makefile.vc [target|macrodef [target|macrodef] [...]]
#
#                        Standard (no frills)
#       c:\tk_src\win\>c:\progra~1\micros~1\vc98\bin\vcvars32.bat
#       Setting environment for using Microsoft Visual C++ tools.
#       c:\tk_src\win\>nmake -f makefile.vc release
#       c:\tk_src\win\>nmake -f makefile.vc install INSTALLDIR=c:\progra~1\tcl
#
#                         Building for Win64
#       c:\tk_src\win\>c:\progra~1\micros~1\vc98\bin\vcvars32.bat
#       Setting environment for using Microsoft Visual C++ tools.
#       c:\tk_src\win\>c:\progra~1\platfo~1\setenv.bat /pre64 /RETAIL
#       Targeting Windows pre64 RETAIL
#       c:\tk_src\win\>nmake -f makefile.vc MACHINE=IA64
