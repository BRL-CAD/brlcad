	* itclMethod.c:          if during call of constructor, when building
	                         an object there were multiple recursive calls
				 on CallItclObjectCmd and errors have not been
				 propagated. Now hadConstructorError
				 field in ItclObject struct is used for that
				 purpose.
	* itclInt.h:
	* itclObject.c:

	* itclObject.c:          allow %:var_name substitution in delegate
	                         method using part for extendedclass

	* itclObject.c:          allow call of delegated methods in constructor
	                         of ::itcl::extendedclass
	* itclBuiltin.c:
	* itclMethod.c:


2009-10-23 Arnulf P. Wiedemann <wiede@users.sf.net>
        * generic/itcl.h:        bumped version to 4.0b4
	* configure.in:
	* configure:

	* itclClass.c:           fixed bug which prevented correct error
	                         reporting when there was a problem when
				 creating an object, also fixed to use correct
				 NRE calling

2009-10-23  Arnulf P. Wiedemann <wiede@users.sourceforge.net>
	* itclMigrate2TclCore.c: added Itcl_GetUplevelCallFrame and 
	                         Itcl_ActivateCallFrame functions
	                         same as in Itcl3.4. They are needed to call
				 the itk_component command with the suitable
				 call frame as this is needed for access to the
	                         proc local vars. This was the fix for SF 
				 bug #2840994
	* itclStubInit.c:
	* itcl.decls:
	* itclDecls.h:
	* itclIntDecls.h:

	* itclResolve.c:         added special_resolve_vars. Also needed
	                         for SF bug #2840994

	* generic/itclParse.c:	fix for bug  #2871541.
	       added a lot of checks if within a class
	       environment (iclsPtr != NULL), as there
	       were a lot of similar cases

	* itclTclIntStubsFcn.c:

	* fix for problem with scope command path reported by 
	* Harald Krummeck on c.l.t ItclCmd.c
2008-02-02 Arnulf P. Wiedemann <wiede@users.sf.net>
        * generic/itcl.h configure.in:
	             bumped version to 4.0b3
2008-02-01 Arnulf P. Wiedemann <wiede@users.sf.net>
        * tests/widgetadaptor.test and tests/widgetclass.test:
	             removed package require Tk to avoid running the tests
		     always
2008-01-24 Arnulf P. Wiedemann <wiede@users.sf.net>
	* generic/itclBase.c:	added *Dict*Info functions to allow fully
	* generic/itclBuiltin.c:integration of itclWidget package.
	* generic/itclClass.c:  itclWidget package is no longer needed.
	* generic/itclCmd.c:	The *Dict*Info* function also allow in the
	* generic/itclObject.c: future to replace itclInfo.c by a scripted
	* generic/itclParse.c:  version written in tcl.
	* generic/itclInfo.c:   For replacing itclWidget package itclWidget.tcl
	* generic/itclMethod.c: has been filled with new procs, which are
	* library/itclWidget.tcl:called from the C parts, when needed.

	* generic/itclHelpers.c:here one can find all the *Dict*Info functions

	* library/ictlHullCmds.tcl:
				here are similar funtions to itclWidget.tcl for
				use by ::itcl::extendedclass

	* generic/itclUtil.c:	malloc.h include now bracketed with 
				#ifdef ITCL_PRESERVE_DEBUG as it is only used
				for debugging. I have to look for a solution
				using memory.h as a portable version, but
				for that I have to understand that first.
				With #ifdef ITCL_PRESERVE_DEBUG, the malloc
				and free calls can be used again, these are
				necessary, as im am checking stuff done by
				ckalloc and ckfree, so these cannot be used.
2009-01-15 David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>
	* generic/itcl2TclOO.h:  More cleanups changing the last of the 
	* generic/itclClass.c:   'EXTERN' macros to just be 'extern' as we 
	* win/.cvsignore:        aren't importing the declaration, just  
	* win/itcl.rc:           sharing it internally.  This caused warnings 
	* win/makefile.vc:       on windows during the link stage as it was 
	* win/nmakehlp.c:        getting confused about 'why are you 
	* win/rules.vc:          importing an internal function?'
2009-01-15 David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>
	* generic/itclMigrate2TclCore.h:    All build errors squashed
	* generic/itclStubLib.c:

    * new commands ::itcl::struct, ::itcl::nwidget ::itcl::addoption and
    * ::itcl::addcomponent
    * some rearraging of functions for options and delegation, so that
    * these can be used in the above commands without the need to load

    * The above commands will be used for a prototype implementation
    * of NexTk (from George Peter Staplin) with Itcl using the megapkg
    * package of George Peter Staplin as a base
