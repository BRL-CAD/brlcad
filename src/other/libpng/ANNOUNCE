Changes since the last public release (1.4.0):

version 1.4.1 [February 25, 2010]

  Updated CMakeLists.txt for consistent indentation and to avoid an
    unclosed if-statement warning (Philip Lowman).
  Revised Makefile.am and Makefile.in to remove references to Y2KINFO,
    KNOWNBUG, and libpng.la (Robert Schwebel).
  Revised the makefiles to install the same files and symbolic
    except for libpng.la and libpng14.la.
  Make png_set|get_compression_buffer_size() available even when
    PNG_WRITE_SUPPORTED is not enabled.
  Revised Makefile.am and Makefile.in to simplify their maintenance.
  Revised the makefiles to install a link to libpng14.so.14.1
  Removed png_set_premultiply_alpha() from scripts/*.def
  Revised png_decompress_chunk() to improve speed and memory usage when
    decoding large chunks, using a two-pass method suggested by John Bowler.
  Added png_set|get_chunk_malloc_max() functions.
  Relocated "int k" declaration in pngtest.c to minimize its scope.
  Folded some long lines in the source files.
  Added defineable PNG_USER_CHUNK_CACHE_MAX and PNG_USER_CHUNK_MALLOC_MAX
  Eliminated use of png_ptr->irowbytes and reused the slot in png_ptr as
    png_ptr->png_user_chunk_malloc_max.
  Return allocated "old_buffer" in png_push_save_buffer() before calling
    png_error(), to avoid a potential memory leak.
  Removed the cbuilder5 project, which has not been updated to 1.4.0.
  Complete rewrite of two-pass png_decompress_chunk() by John Bowler.
  Removed obsolete unused MMX-querying support from contrib/gregbook
  Removed the AIX redefinition of jmpbuf in png.h
  Define _ALL_SOURCE in configure.ac, makefile.aix, and CMakeLists.txt
    when using AIX compiler.
  Removed unused gzio.c from contrib/pngminim gather and makefile scripts
