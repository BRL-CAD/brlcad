Changes since the last public release (1.4.2):
  Added missing quotation marks in the aix block of configure.ac
  The new "vstudio" project was missing from the zip and 7z distributions.
  Rewrote png_process_IDAT_data to consistently treat extra data as warnings
    and handle end conditions more cleanly.
  Removed the now-redundant check for out-of-bounds new_row from example.c
  Changed char *msg to PNG_CONST char *msg in pngrutil.c
  Stop memory leak when reading a malformed sCAL chunk.
