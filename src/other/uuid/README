  OSSP uuid - Universally Unique Identifier
  Version 1.6.2 (04-Jul-2008)

  ABSTRACT

  OSSP uuid is a ISO-C:1999 application programming interface (API)
  and corresponding command line interface (CLI) for the generation of
  DCE 1.1, ISO/IEC 11578:1996 and IETF RFC-4122 compliant Universally
  Unique Identifier (UUID). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version
  1 (time and node based), version 3 (name based, MD5), version 4
  (random number based) and version 5 (name based, SHA-1). Additional
  API bindings are provided for the languages ISO-C++:1998, Perl:5 and
  PHP:4/5. Optional backward compatibility exists for the ISO-C DCE-1.1
  and Perl Data::UUID APIs.

  UUIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high likelihood
  of uniqueness over space and time and are computationally difficult
  to guess. They are globally unique identifiers which can be locally
  generated without contacting a global registration authority. UUIDs
  are intended as unique identifiers for both mass tagging objects
  with an extremely short lifetime and to reliably identifying very
  persistent objects across a network.
