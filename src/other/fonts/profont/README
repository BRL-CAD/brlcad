This directory contains the fonts from ProFont Distribution 2.2
as stored at http://www.tobias-jung.de/seekingprofont/

On June 14, 2010 Carl Osterwald gave permission to place ProFont
under the SIL Open Font License - the COPYING file has been added
to reflect this change/clarification.

The original StuffIt archive has been opened and reorganized as
follows:

The About ProFont Distribution 2 rich text file has been converted
to a pdf file and named about_old.pdf

The ProFont Quick Start rich text file has been converted to a
text file and named quickstart_old.txt

The original contents of the ProFont, ProFontWindows, and ProFontISOLatin1
directories have been preserved in original.tar

For each of the three directories above, fontforge was used to
open the font and save *.sfd and *.ttf files.  These are currently
naive open-and-save outputs with none of the corrective fixes
present in the other versions on the tobias-jung website.  Ideally,
a unified version with proper permissions from all copyright holders
can be assembled that contains the proper settings and fixes - that
would be the next step to attempt.
