Carl at "carl_osterwald@usa.net" In addition to hearing about any
problems you have, we'd be very pleased to hear from you if you like ProFont
Distribution!

* How can I get started with ProFont immediately?

If you want to install the latest version of the ProFont font, open the
"ProFont 2.2 f" folder and drag the "ProFont" suitcase to your System Folder
icon. When asked if it's OK to put it in the "Fonts Folder", say "OK".
If you want to use ProFont as a replacement for Monaco 9, then first install
ProFont as outlined above. Then, open the "Monaco Tuner 1.1.1 f" folder and
drag the "Monaco Tuner" control panel to your System Folder icon. When
asked if it's OK to put it in the "Control Panels Folder", say "OK". Then
restart your Macintosh.

After following the above instructions, you'll see ProFont 9 wherever you
would otherwise have seen Monaco 9. Enjoy.
