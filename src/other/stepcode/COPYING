This software was produced by the National Institute of Standards and

Acknowledgements:
The STEP Class Library (SCL) was developed by the Manufacturing 
Systems Integration Division at NIST to support testing of the 
Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data (a.k.a STEP) and 
validation of STEP's emerging implementation specifications. Funding 
for the project has come from the Department of Commerce and the 
Department of Defense agencies including the Office of the Defense 
CALS (Continuous Acquisition and Life-Cycle Support) Executive and 
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Recent 
enhancements were sponsored by the National Information Infrastructure 
Protocols Consortium and NIST's Systems Integration for Manufacturing 
Applications (SIMA) program.
