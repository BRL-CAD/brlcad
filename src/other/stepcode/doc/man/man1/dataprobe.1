.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The Validation Testing System (VTS) Data Probe software is a program
for browsing and editing data corresponding to a conceptual model
described using the language Express.  A separate program (exp2cxx)
reads in a schema and generates source code to represent the schema in
C++.  This code is linked with the libraries in the STEP Class Library
to create a schema specific editor.  The editor is X Windows based and
uses the InterViews Toolkit from Stanford.

.SH USAGE
.LP
The Data Probe supports the editing of data in the format specified in
Part 21 of the ISO 10103.  It allows the user to create or modify
instance data, to check for consistency with an Express schema and to
examine the relationships of entities within the schema.  These
functions are supported in one or more of the following five types of
Data Probe windows:

.nf
    Data Probe Window: supports general Data Probe func-
    tionalities, including file management, schema list
    browsing, and quitting Data Probe.

    Entity Type List window: contains a scrollable list
    of schema-specific entities for browsing or creating
    instances of entities.

    Entity Instance List window: contains a scrollable
    list of instances of entities.  Supports data view-
    ing and modification. 

    STEP Entity Editor window:  occurs for each instance
    being edited. Supports several data editing opera-
    tions including modify, delete and save.

    STEP Entity Descriptor window: contains information
    pertaining to an entity type including the list of
    attributes and subtypes for the selected entity.

    Each of these windows is described in detail below.

DATA PROBE WINDOW
.nf

The Data Probe window is one of three windows appearing
initially when the Data Probe is run.  It is composed of
the following four sections:

             1. title
             2. menu bar
             3. quick reference
             4. message bar

Each of these sections is described in detail below:

.I
Data Probe Window title section:
.fi
.LP
The title section shows the name of the schema for which the Data
Probe was created preceeded by the prefix 'DP-'.
.nf
   
.I
Data Probe Window menu bar section:

The menu bar consists of two pull-down menus labeled
Quit and File Management.

   The Quit pull-down menu allows the user to exit Data
   Probe. No warnings will be given before exiting. 
  
   The File Management pull-down menu allows the user to
   perform operations on the following file types:

     Exchange Files  Data saved to these files must be in 
                     complete STEP file format and must be 
                     provided for all required attributes 
                     in order to be used by application 
                     programs that will rely on this data.                   

     Working Files   These  files will not be used by appli-
                     cation programs and serve the purpose 
                     of storing intermediate data for saving
                     the editing session.

     Backup File     This file is written regularly during
                     a Data Probe session to contain the
                     current Entity Instance List data.  The
                     backup file is written in Working File
                     form.  The default backup file is 
                     dpAutoSave.wf and is written to the 
                     directory where the command to run Data 
                     Probe was issued unless instructed
                     otherwise by the user (See 'Backup File'
                     in table below and OPTIONS above).
                     

   The File Management pull-down menu supports file manage-
   ment and other options as follows:

.I
ENTITY TYPE LIST WINDOW

The Entity Type List is the second of the three windows appearing initially when the Data Probe is run.  The Entity Type List displays the list of schema-specific entity types. In addition to the operations outlined in 'Using Lists' below, the Entity Type List allows the user to create an instance as follows:
.nf

.I
Creating an Instance

    1. Select an entity type from the type list.

    2. Select Create

        -  use Create button or

        -  type 'C'.

    3. A STEP Entity Editor window appears for editing 
       the entity selected (See the STEP Entity Editor
       Window section below).



.fi
.I
ENTITY INSTANCE LIST WINDOW

The Entity Instance List is the third of three windows initially appearing when the Data Probe is run.  When an entity is selected from the Entity Type List or when instances are read in from a file, the instanced entities will appear on the Entity Instance List.  In addition to the operations outlined in 'Using Lists' below, the Entity Instance List allows the user to view, modify, and save instances of entities.
.nf

.I
Edit State Markers:
.fi
.LP
The selection of any of the preceeding options is represented by an edit state code.  An instance can be marked with an edit state option by typing the key which correlates to that option.  The marked option is shown in lower case on the left of the selected instance.  When the execute button is pressed, all marked options will be executed, reflected by an upper case letter edit state code which replaces the lower case marker to the left of the intance.

Below is a description of Entity List edit state codes and the keys that are used to select them:

KEY                 OPERATION                    EDIT STATE

 s   save complete (no capital letter) -- All     (blank)
     attribute values associated with the 
     instance must be  valid and all required 
     attributes must exist.

 i   save incomplete -- All attribute values         I
     associated with the instance must be  
     valid, however all required attributes 
     may not exist.  This allows attribute 
     values to be saved even though the entity 
     is incomplete.  It also provides a way 
     for a user to mark an instance as needing 
     further attention even if all required 
     attributes exist.

 d   delete -- the entities in this edit             D
     state will be deleted when the contents 
     of the instance list are written to a 
     file.

 m   modify -- open an editor window for             M
     modifying instances.

 v   view -- open an editor window for view-         V
     ing only.



.I
STEP ENTITY EDITOR (SEE) WINDOW 

The edit state options described above can also be executed from the STEP Entity Editor Window (SEE).  The SEE Window is opened whenever the modify or view option is executed from the Entity Instance List or when an entity is created from the Entity Type List.  The following are the operations supported in the SEE window:

.nf
.I
Changing the Edit State of an Entity

 save instance to a complete state       C-x C-s

 save instance to an incomplete state    C-x C-i

STEP ENTITY DESCRIPTOR WINDOW (SED)

The SED window enables the user to review information regarding an entity type.  It may be opened by selecting the Type Information box in the Entity Type List or SEE window (See the Entity Type List and STEP Entity Editor window sections above).  A SED window may also be opened from within a SED window as is described below. 
.nf

   Format of a SED window:

   1. Entity Descriptor Boxes

      The body of a SED window is composed of entity descrip-
      tor boxes.  These boxes are shown in order of inheri-
      tance starting with the selected entity type at the bot-
      tom of the window up to the root entity type shown at the
      top of the window. Each entity descriptor box contains a
      title bar, an attribute list and a subtype list described
      below.

        title bar - contains the name of the entity 
        in bold print at the left corner and the schema 
        in which the entity is defined at the right corner.

        attribute list - a scrollable list of attributes 
        defined in the corresponding entity shown on the 
        left side of the descriptor box.

        subtype list - a scrollable list of the subtypes 
        of the corresponding entity shown on the right side 
        of the descriptor box.

    2. Attr. Type subwindow 

       The Attr. Type subwindow shown at the bottom of the SED
       window displays further information regarding a selected
       attrtibute.    

   Using a SED window:

   1. Scrolling the attribute/subtype list

      a. Place mouse pointer on up/down arrow.

      b. Press right mouse button.

   2. Viewing a detailed description of an attribute:

      a. Place mouse pointer on desired
         attribute.

      b. Double click mouse button.  A detailed description
         of the attribute type will be displayed in the 
         Attr. Type subwindow located at the bottom of the
         SED window.

   3. Opening a SED window from the current SED window:

      a. Place mouse cursor on the desired entity from
         an entity subytpe list.

      b. Double click the mouse button.  A new SED window
         will appear for the entity type selected.

   3. Collapsing/Uncollapsing a descriptor box

      Collapse - show title bar only 
      Uncollapse - show attribute and subtype lists

      a. Place mouse cursor on collapse button of desired
         descriptor box.

      b. Click left mouse button.  This will cause the 
         descriptor box to switch from uncollapsed to 
         collapsed or vice-versa depending on the current
         state of the descriptor box.

   Exiting a SED window:

.SH NOTE
.LP
The source code for the Data Probe was designed with reusability in
mind.  The code uses the STEP Class Library (developed at NIST) and
the InterViews Toolkit (from Stanford).  The STEP Class Library is
divided into four libraries: Stepcore & Editor, Utilities, General
User Interface, and Probe.  Dependencies between these modules has
been minimized so that the executable program, the Data Probe, can be
easily reconfigured to support different conceptual schemas.

All NISTIR documents may be obtained through the National Technical
Information Service (NTIS), Springfield VA 22161, USA.  Postscript
files may be obtained through anonymous ftp from ftp.cme.nist.gov (see
pub/step/nptdocs/readme.txt to determine the appropriate file to
