Introduction
--------------------

This is the README for Exppp, an EXPRESS Pretty Printer for the NIST
EXPRESS Toolkit.  It is described in detail by the report: Libes, D.,
"Exppp - An EXPRESS Pretty Printer", NISTIR 5292, Gaithersburg, MD,
November 8, 1993.  You can obtain this report from ftp.cme.nist.gov
as pub/step/nptdocs/exppp.ps.Z

--------------------
Installing
--------------------

First install the NIST EXPRESS Toolkit.  This is described in the
document "The NIST EXPRESS Toolkit - Obtaining and Installing" which
can be obtained from ftp.cme.nist.gov as
pub/step/nptdocs/obtaining-installing.ps.Z

Installing Exppp is very similar to the NIST EXPRESS Toolkit itself.
Adjust any parameters in the Makefile and do "make install".

This will build and install an executable called exppp and a library
called libexppp.a.

exppp is similar to fedex except that exppp recreates the schemas and
stores them in separate files.  The library is described further in
the report on Exppp (see above).
