 * TkPreprocessMenu --
 *
 *	On the Mac and on Windows, all of the postcommand processing has to be
 *	done on the entire tree underneath the main window to be posted. This
 *	means that we have to traverse the menu tree and issue the
 *	postcommands for all of the menus that have cascades attached. Since
 *	the postcommands can change the menu structure while we are
 *	traversing, we have to be extremely careful. Basically, the idea is to
 *	traverse the structure until we succesfully process one postcommand.
 *	Then we start over, and do it again until we traverse the whole
 *	structure without processing any postcommands.
 *
 *	We are also going to set up the cascade back pointers in here since we
 *	have to traverse the entire structure underneath the menu anyway. We
 *	can clear the postcommand marks while we do that.
 *
 * Results:
 *	The return value is a standard Tcl result (errors can occur while the
 *	postcommands are being processed).
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	Since commands can get executed while this routine is being executed,
 *	the entire world can change.
