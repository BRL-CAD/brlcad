.SH NAME
Tk_MapWindow, Tk_UnmapWindow \- map or unmap a window
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
Tk_Window
\fBTk_MapWindow\fR(\fItkwin\fR)
.sp
\fBTk_UnmapWindow\fR(\fItkwin\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tk_Window parent
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Token for window.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures may be used to map and unmap windows
managed by Tk.  \fBTk_MapWindow\fR maps the window given
by \fItkwin\fR, and also creates an X window corresponding
to \fItkwin\fR if it does not already exist.  See the
\fBTk_CreateWindow\fR manual entry for information on
deferred window creation.
\fBTk_UnmapWindow\fR unmaps \fItkwin\fR's window
from the screen.
.PP
If \fItkwin\fR is a child window (i.e. \fBTk_CreateWindow\fR was
used to create a child window), then event handlers interested in map 
and unmap events are invoked immediately.  If \fItkwin\fR is not an 
internal window, then the event handlers will be invoked later, after 
X has seen the request and returned an event for it.
.PP
These procedures should be used in place of the X procedures
\fBXMapWindow\fR and \fBXUnmapWindow\fR, since they update
Tk's local data structure for \fItkwin\fR.  Applications
using Tk should not invoke \fBXMapWindow\fR and \fBXUnmapWindow\fR
directly.
