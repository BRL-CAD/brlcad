.SH NAME
destroy \- Destroy one or more windows
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdestroy \fR?\fIwindow window ...\fR?
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command deletes the windows given by the
\fIwindow\fR arguments, plus all of their descendants.
If a \fIwindow\fR

is deleted then all windows will be destroyed and the application will
(normally) exit.
The \fIwindow\fRs are destroyed in order, and if an error occurs
in destroying a window the command aborts without destroying the
remaining windows.
No error is returned if \fIwindow\fR does not exist.
.SH EXAMPLE
Destroy all checkbuttons that are direct children of the given widget:
.CS
proc killCheckbuttonChildren {parent} {
   foreach w [winfo children $parent] {
      if {[winfo class $w] eq "Checkbutton"} {
         \fBdestroy\fR $w
      }
   }
}
