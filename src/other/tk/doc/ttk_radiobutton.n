.SH "WIDGET COMMAND"
In addition to the standard 
\fBcget\fR, \fBconfigure\fR, \fBidentify\fR, \fBinstate\fR, and \fBstate\fR 
commands, radiobuttons support the following additional
widget commands:
.TP
\fIpathname\fB invoke\fR
Sets the \fB\-variable\fR to the \fB\-value\fR, selects the widget,
and evaluates the associated \fB\-command\fR.  
Returns the result of the \fB\-command\fR, or the empty
string if no \fB\-command\fR is specified.
.\" Missing: select, deselect.  Useful?
.\" Missing: flash.  This is definitely not useful.
.SH "WIDGET STATES"
The widget does not respond to user input if the \fBdisabled\fR state is set.
The widget sets the \fBselected\fR state whenever 
the linked \fB\-variable\fR is set to the widget's \fB\-value\fR,
and clears it otherwise.
The widget sets the \fBalternate\fR state whenever the 
linked \fB\-variable\fR is unset.  
(The \fBalternate\fR state may be used to indicate a
.QW tri-state
or
.QW indeterminate
selection.)
