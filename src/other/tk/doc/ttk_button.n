.OP \-command command Command
A script to evaluate when the widget is invoked.
.OP \-default default Default
May be set to one of  \fBnormal\fR, \fBactive\fR, or \fBdisabled\fR.
In a dialog box, one button may be designated the
.QW default
button (meaning, roughly,
.QW "the one that gets invoked when the user presses <Enter>" ).
\fBactive\fR indicates that this is currently the default button;
\fBnormal\fR means that it may become the default button, and
\fBdisabled\fR means that it is not defaultable.
The default is \fBnormal\fR.
.RS
.PP
Depending on the theme, the default button may be displayed 
with an extra highlight ring, or with a different border color.
.RE
.OP \-width width Width

to allocate for the text label.  
If less than zero, specifies a minimum width.
If zero or unspecified, the natural width of the text label is used.
Note that some themes may specify a non-zero \fB\-width\fR
in the style.

.SH "WIDGET COMMAND"
.PP
In addition to the standard 
\fBcget\fR, \fBconfigure\fR, \fBidentify\fR, \fBinstate\fR, and \fBstate\fR 
commands, buttons support the following additional widget commands:
.TP
\fIpathName \fBinvoke\fR
Invokes the command associated with the button.
.SH "STANDARD STYLES"
.PP
\fBTtk::button\fR widgets support the \fBToolbutton\fR style in all standard
themes, which is useful for creating widgets for toolbars.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY OPTIONS"
.OP \-state state State
May be set to \fBnormal\fR or \fBdisabled\fR to control the
\fBdisabled\fR state bit. This is a
.QW write-only
option: setting it changes the widget state, but the \fBstate\fR
widget command does not affect the state option.
