.SH NAME
tk_chooseDirectory \- pops up a dialog box for the user to select a directory.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtk_chooseDirectory \fR?\fIoption value ...\fR?
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The procedure \fBtk_chooseDirectory\fR pops up a dialog box for the
user to select a directory. The following \fIoption\-value\fR pairs are
possible as command line arguments:
.TP
\fB\-command\fR \fIstring\fR
Specifies the prefix of a Tcl command to invoke when the user closes the
dialog after having selected an item. This callback is not called if the
user cancelled the dialog. The actual command consists of \fIstring\fR
followed by a space and the value selected by the user in the dialog. This
is only available on Mac OS X.
.TP
\fB\-initialdir\fR \fIdirname\fR
Specifies that the directories in \fIdirectory\fR should be displayed
when the dialog pops up. If this parameter is not specified,
the initial directory defaults to the current working directory
on non-Windows systems and on Windows systems prior to Vista.
On Vista and later systems, the initial directory defaults to the last
user-selected directory for the application. If the
parameter specifies a relative path, the return value will convert the
relative path to an absolute path.
.TP
\fB\-message\fR \fIstring\fR
Specifies a message to include in the client area of the dialog.
This is only available on Mac OS X.
.TP
\fB\-mustexist\fR \fIboolean\fR
Specifies whether the user may specify non-existent directories.  If
this parameter is true, then the user may only select directories that
already exist.  The default value is \fIfalse\fR.
.TP
\fB\-parent\fR \fIwindow\fR
Makes \fIwindow\fR the logical parent of the dialog. The dialog
is displayed on top of its parent window. On Mac OS X, this
turns the file dialog into a sheet attached to the parent window.
.TP
\fB\-title\fR \fItitleString\fR
Specifies a string to display as the title of the dialog box. If this
option is not specified, then a default title will be displayed.
