.SH NAME
loadTk \- Load Tk into a safe interpreter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB::safe::loadTk \fIslave\fR ?\fB\-use\fR \fIwindowId\fR? ?\fB\-display\fR \fIdisplayName\fR? 
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Safe Tk is based on Safe Tcl, which provides a mechanism 
that allows restricted and mediated
access to auto-loading and packages for safe interpreters.
Safe Tk adds the ability to configure the interpreter
for safe Tk operations and load Tk into safe 
interpreters.
.PP
The \fB::safe::loadTk\fR command initializes the required data structures
in the named safe interpreter and then loads Tk into it.
The interpreter must have been created with \fB::safe::interpCreate\fR
or have been initialized with \fB::safe::interpInit\fR.
The command returns the name of the safe interpreter.
If \fB\-use\fR is specified, the window identified by the specified system
dependent identifier \fIwindowId\fR is used to contain the
.QW .
window of the safe interpreter; it can be any valid id, eventually 
referencing a window belonging to another application. As a convenience,
if the window you plan to use is a Tk Window of the application you
can use the window name (e.g. \fB.x.y\fR) instead of its window Id 
(\fB[winfo id .x.y]\fR).
When \fB\-use\fR is not specified,
a new toplevel window is created for the
.QW .
window of
the safe interpreter. On X11 if you want the embedded window
to use another display than the default one, specify it with
\fB\-display\fR.
See the \fBSECURITY ISSUES\fR section below for implementation details.

.SH "SECURITY ISSUES"
.PP
Please read the \fBsafe\fR manual page for Tcl to learn about the basic
security considerations for Safe Tcl.
.PP
\fB::safe::loadTk\fR adds the value of \fBtk_library\fR taken from the master
interpreter to the virtual access path of the safe interpreter so that
auto-loading will work in the safe interpreter.
.PP
.PP
Tk initialization is now safe with respect to not trusting
the slave's state for startup. \fB::safe::loadTk\fR
registers the slave's name so
when the Tk initialization (\fBTk_SafeInit\fR) is called
and in turn calls the master's \fB::safe::InitTk\fR it will
return the desired \fBargv\fR equivalent (\fB\-use\fR 
\fIwindowId\fR, correct \fB\-display\fR, etc.)
.PP
When \fB\-use\fR is not used, the new toplevel created is specially
decorated so the user is always aware that the user interface presented comes
from a potentially unsafe code and can easily delete the corresponding
interpreter.
.PP
On X11, conflicting \fB\-use\fR and \fB\-display\fR are likely
to generate a fatal X error.
