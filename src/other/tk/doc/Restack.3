.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_RestackWindow\fR changes the stacking order of \fIwindow\fR relative
to its siblings.
If \fIother\fR is specified as NULL then \fIwindow\fR is repositioned
at the top or bottom of its stacking order, depending on whether
\fIaboveBelow\fR is \fBAbove\fR or \fBBelow\fR.
If \fIother\fR has a non-NULL value then \fIwindow\fR is repositioned
just above or below \fIother\fR.
.PP
The \fIaboveBelow\fR argument must have one of the symbolic values
\fBAbove\fR or \fBBelow\fR.
Both of these values are defined by the include file <X11/Xlib.h>.
