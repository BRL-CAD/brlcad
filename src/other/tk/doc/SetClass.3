.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_SetClass\fR is called to associate a class with a particular
window.  The \fIclass\fR string identifies the type of the
window;  all windows with the same general class of behavior
(button, menu, etc.) should have the same class.  By
convention all class names start with a capital letter, and
there exists a Tcl command with the same name as
each class (except all in lower-case) which can be used to
create and manipulate windows of that class.
A window's class string is initialized to NULL
when the window is created.
.PP
For main windows, Tk automatically propagates the name and class
to the WM_CLASS property used by window managers.  This happens
either when a main window is actually created (e.g. in
\fBTk_MakeWindowExist\fR), or when \fBTk_SetClass\fR
is called, whichever occurs later.  If a main window has not been
assigned a class then Tk will not set the WM_CLASS property for
the window.
.PP
\fBTk_Class\fR is a macro that returns the
current value of \fItkwin\fR's class.  The value is returned
as a Tk_Uid, which may be used just like a string pointer but also has
the properties of a unique identifier (see the manual entry for
\fBTk_GetUid\fR for details).
If \fItkwin\fR has not yet been given a class, then
\fBTk_Class\fR will return NULL.

.SH KEYWORDS
class, unique identifier, window, window manager
