A \fBttk::panedwindow\fR widget displays a number of subwindows, stacked
either vertically or horizontally.  The user may adjust the relative sizes
of the subwindows by dragging the sash between panes.

.SH "WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS"
.OP \-orient orient Orient
Specifies the orientation of the window.
If \fBvertical\fR, subpanes are stacked top-to-bottom;
if \fBhorizontal\fR, subpanes are stacked left-to-right.
.OP \-width width Width
If present and greater than zero, 
specifies the desired width of the widget in pixels.
Otherwise, the requested width is determined by the width
of the managed windows.
.OP \-height height Height
If present and greater than zero, 
specifies the desired height of the widget in pixels.
Otherwise, the requested height is determined by the height
of the managed windows.
.SH "PANE OPTIONS"
The following options may be specified for each pane:
.OP \-weight weight Weight
An integer specifying the relative stretchability of the pane.
When the paned window is resized, the extra space is added
or subtracted to each pane proportionally to its \fB\-weight\fR.
.SH "WIDGET COMMAND"
Supports the standard \fBconfigure\fR, \fBcget\fR, \fBstate\fR, 
and \fBinstate\fR commands; see \fIttk::widget(n)\fR for details.
Additional commands:
.TP
\fIpathname \fBadd\fR \fIsubwindow\fR \fIoptions...\fR
Adds a new pane to the window.
\fIsubwindow\fR must be a direct child of the paned window \fIpathname\fR.
See \fBPANE OPTIONS\fR for the list of available options.
.TP
\fIpathname \fBforget\fR \fIpane\fR
Removes the specified subpane from the widget.
\fIpane\fR is either an integer index or the name of a managed subwindow.
.TP
\fIpathname\fR \fBidentify\fR \fIx y\fR
Returns the index of the sash at point \fIx,y\fR,
or the empty string if \fIx,y\fR is not over a sash.
.TP
\fIpathname \fBinsert\fR \fIpos\fR \fIsubwindow\fR \fIoptions...\fR
Inserts a pane at the specified position.
\fIpos\fR is either the string \fBend\fR, an integer index, 
or the name of a managed subwindow.
If \fIsubwindow\fR is already managed by the paned window, 
moves it to the specified position.
See \fBPANE OPTIONS\fR for the list of available options.
.TP
\fIpathname \fBpane\fR \fIpane \-option \fR?\fIvalue \fR?\fI\-option value...\fR
Query or modify the options of the specified \fIpane\fR,
where \fIpane\fR is either an integer index or the name of a managed subwindow.
If no \fI\-option\fR is specified, returns a dictionary of the pane 
option values.
If one \fI\-option\fR is specified, returns the value of that \fIoption\fR.
Otherwise, sets the \fI\-option\fRs to the corresponding \fIvalue\fRs.
.TP
\fIpathname\fR \fBsashpos\fR \fIindex\fR ?\fInewpos\fR?
If \fInewpos\fR is specified, sets the position 
of sash number \fIindex\fR.
May adjust the positions of adjacent sashes
to ensure that positions are monotonically increasing.
Sash positions are further constrained to be between 0 
and the total size of the widget.
.\" Full story: "total size" is either the -height (resp -width),
.\" or the actual window height (resp actual window width),
.\" depending on which changed most recently.
Returns the new position of sash number \fIindex\fR.
.\" Full story: new position may be different than the requested position.
