.SH DESCRIPTION
A \fBttk::panedwindow\fR widget displays a number of subwindows,
stacked either vertically or horizontally.
The user may adjust the relative sizes of the subwindows
by dragging the sash between panes.

.SH "WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS"
.OP \-orient orient Orient
Specifies the orientation of the window.
If \fBvertical\fR, subpanes are stacked top-to-bottom;
if \fBhorizontal\fR, subpanes are stacked left-to-right.
.OP \-width width Width
If present and greater than zero,
specifies the desired width of the widget in pixels.
Otherwise, the requested width is determined by the width
of the managed windows.
.OP \-height height Height
If present and greater than zero,
specifies the desired height of the widget in pixels.
Otherwise, the requested height is determined by the height
of the managed windows.
.SH "PANE OPTIONS"
The following options may be specified for each pane:
.OP \-weight weight Weight
An integer specifying the relative stretchability of the pane.
When the paned window is resized, the extra space is added
or subtracted to each pane proportionally to its \fB\-weight\fR.
.SH "WIDGET COMMAND"
Supports the standard \fBconfigure\fR, \fBcget\fR, \fBstate\fR,
and \fBinstate\fR commands; see \fIttk::widget(n)\fR for details.
Additional commands:
.TP
\fIpathname\fR \fBadd\fR \fIsubwindow\fR \fIoptions...\fR
Adds a new pane to the window.
See \fBPANE OPTIONS\fR for the list of available options.
.TP
\fIpathname\fR \fBforget\fR \fIpane\fR
Removes the specified subpane from the widget.
\fIpane\fR is either an integer index or the name of a managed subwindow.
.TP
\fIpathname\fR \fBidentify\fR \fIcomponent\fR \fIx\fR \fIy\fR
Returns the name of the element under the point given by \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR,
or the empty string if no component is present at that location.
If \fIcomponent\fR is omitted, it defaults to \fBsash\fR.
The following subcommands are supported:
.RS
.TP
\fIpathname\fR \fBidentify\fR \fBelement\fR \fIx\fR \fIy\fR
Returns the name of the element at the specified location.
.TP
\fIpathname\fR \fBidentify\fR \fBsash\fR \fIx\fR \fIy\fR
Returns the index of the sash at the specified location.
.RE
.TP
\fIpathname\fR \fBinsert\fR \fIpos\fR \fIsubwindow\fR \fIoptions...\fR
Inserts a pane at the specified position.
\fIpos\fR is either the string \fBend\fR, an integer index,
or the name of a managed subwindow.
If \fIsubwindow\fR is already managed by the paned window,
moves it to the specified position.
See \fBPANE OPTIONS\fR for the list of available options.
.TP
\fIpathname\fR \fBpane\fR \fIpane \-option \fR?\fIvalue \fR?\fI\-option value...\fR
Query or modify the options of the specified \fIpane\fR,
where \fIpane\fR is either an integer index or the name of a managed subwindow.
If no \fI\-option\fR is specified, returns a dictionary of the pane
option values.
If one \fI\-option\fR is specified, returns the value of that \fIoption\fR.
Otherwise, sets the \fI\-option\fRs to the corresponding \fIvalue\fRs.
.TP
\fIpathname\fR \fBpanes\fR
Returns the list of all windows managed by the widget.
.TP
\fIpathname\fR \fBsashpos\fR \fIindex\fR ?\fInewpos\fR?
If \fInewpos\fR is specified, sets the position
of sash number \fIindex\fR.
May adjust the positions of adjacent sashes
to ensure that positions are monotonically increasing.
Sash positions are further constrained to be between 0
and the total size of the widget.
.\" Full story: "total size" is either the -height (resp -width),
.\" or the actual window height (resp actual window width),
.\" depending on which changed most recently.
Returns the new position of sash number \fIindex\fR.
.\" Full story: new position may be different than the requested position.
.SH "VIRTUAL EVENTS"
.PP
The panedwindow widget generates an \fB<<EnteredChild>>\fR virtual event on
LeaveNotify/NotifyInferior events, because Tk does not execute binding scripts
for <Leave> events when the pointer crosses from a parent to a child. The
panedwindow widget needs to know when that happens.
