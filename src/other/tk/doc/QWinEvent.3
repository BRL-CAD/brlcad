.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_CollapseMotionEvents\fR(\fIdisplay, collapse\fR)
.sp
\fBTk_QueueWindowEvent\fR(\fIeventPtr, position\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_QueuePosition position
.AP Display *display  in
Display for which to control motion event collapsing.
.AP int collapse in
Indicates whether motion events should be collapsed or not.
.AP XEvent *eventPtr  in
An event to add to the event queue. It is important
that all unused fields of the structure be set to zero.
.AP Tcl_QueuePosition position in
Where to add the new event in the queue:  \fBTCL_QUEUE_TAIL\fR,
\fBTCL_QUEUE_HEAD\fR, or \fBTCL_QUEUE_MARK\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_QueueWindowEvent\fR places a window event on Tcl's internal event
queue for eventual servicing.  It creates a Tcl_Event structure, copies the
event into that structure, and calls \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR to add the event
to the queue.  When the event is eventually removed from the queue it is
processed just like all window events.
.PP
When multiple motion events are received for the same window in rapid
succession, they are collapsed by default.  This behavior can be controlled
with \fBTk_CollapseMotionEvents\fR.  \fBTk_CollapseMotionEvents\fR always
returns the previous value for collapse behavior on the \fIdisplay\fR.
.PP
The \fIposition\fR argument to \fBTk_QueueWindowEvent\fR has
the same significance as for \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR;  see the
documentation for \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR for details.
