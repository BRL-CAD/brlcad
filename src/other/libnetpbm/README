Netpbm is a toolkit for manipulation of graphic images, including
conversion of images between a variety of different formats.  There
are over 300 separate tools in the package including converters for
about 100 graphics formats.  Examples of the sort of image
manipulation we're talking about are: Shrinking an image by 10%;
Cutting the top half off of an image; Making a mirror image; Creating
a sequence of images that fade from one image to another;

The subset of netpbm available here is just the "libnetpbm" that provies
basic support for pbm, ppm, pnm and friends.  Rather than using the standard
netpbm Make system, it is configured and built with CMake.
