The 'poly2tri' package is a C++ library for creating a constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) of a polygon using 
a sweep-line algorithm. This package is being considered to aid in the generation of facet meshes for BRL-CAD NURBS. 
This version 'poly2tri'  was obtained from github at 'git://github.com/jhasse/poly2tri.git' and is a cleaned up of 
version of the google 'poly2tri' project based on the paper "Sweep-line algorithm for constrained Delaunay 
triangulation" by V. Domiter and and B. Zalik.
