This directory contains enough of the libxml2, libxslt and libexslt
libraries to produce a functional xsltproc program on multiple
platforms.  The CMake build logic has been added by the BRL-CAD team
to allow for easy building on multiple platforms, but does not
encompass the whole of the feature sets available in libxml2 and
libxslt - just enough to enable xsltproc to function.  xsltproc is
used by BRL-CAD to produce HTML output (among other formats) from 
Docbook documentation source files - since we need that documentation
on platforms (Windows) that don't usually have a pre-installed
xsltproc handy, we guarantee our ability to generate it by
building our own xsltproc at need.

Each library subdirectory has its Copyright file, and libxml2's
license statement has been added to the header of xsltproc.c

ResolveCompilerPaths.cmake is from Jed Brown and uses the same
license as CMake (Modified BSD - see the .cmake file)

BRL-CAD authored CMake logic in this directory is under the Modified
BSD license (note that this is NOT the license of libxml2, libxslt,
or other non-BRL-CAD authored code in this directory - for that 
see the Copyright files and file headers!)
