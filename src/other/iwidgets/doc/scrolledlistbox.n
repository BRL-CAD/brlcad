Specifies a Tcl command procedure which is called when an item is
double clicked.  Typically this occurs when mouse button 1 is double 
clicked over an item.  Selection policy does not matter.

Name:	\fBheight\fR
Class:	\fBHeight\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB-height\fR

.IP
Specifies the height of the scrolled list box as an entire unit.
The value may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to 
\fBTk_GetPixels\fR.  Any additional space needed to display the other
components such as labels, margins, and scrollbars force the listbox
to be compressed.  A value of zero along with the same value for 
the width causes the value given for the visibleitems option 
to be applied which administers geometry constraints in a different
manner.  The default height is zero.

Specifies the the display mode to be used for the horizontal
scrollbar: \fBstatic, dynamic,\fR or \fBnone\fR.  In static mode, the 
scroll bar is displayed at all times.  Dynamic mode displays the
scroll bar as required, and none disables the scroll bar display.  The 
default is static.

Class:	\fBMargin\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB-scrollmargin\fR

Class:	\fBState\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB-state\fR

.IP
Specifies one of two states for the listbox: \fBnormal\fR or \fBdisabled\fR.
If the listbox is disabled then selection is ignored.  The default is
normal.
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBtextBackground\fR
Class:	\fBBackground\fR
Command-Line Switch \fB-textbackground\fR
.fi
.IP
Specifies the background color for the listbox.  This allows the background 
within the listbox to be different from the normal background color.
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBtextFont\fR
Class:	\fBFont\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB-textfont\fR
.fi
.IP
Specifies the font to be used for text in the listbox.  This allows for 
the font associated with text internal to the scrolled listbox to be 
different than the font for labels.
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBvisibleitems\fR
Class:	\fBVisibleItems\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB-visibleitems\fR
.fi
.IP
Specifies the widthxheight in characters and lines for the listbox.
This option is only administered if the width and height options
are both set to zero, otherwise they take precedence.  The default value
is 20x10.  With the visibleitems option engaged, geometry constraints 
are maintained only on the listbox.  The size of the other components such as 
labels, margins, and scroll bars, are additive and independent, 
effecting the overall size of the scrolled list box.  In contrast,
should the width and height options have non zero values, they
are applied to the scrolled list box as a whole.  The listbox 
is compressed or expanded to maintain the geometry constraints.

Specifies the the display mode to be used for the vertical
scrollbar: \fBstatic, dynamic,\fR or \fBnone\fR.  In static mode, the 
scroll bar is displayed at all times.  Dynamic mode displays the 
scroll bar as required, and none disables the scroll bar display.  The 
default is static.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBiwidgets::scrolledlistbox\fR command creates 
a scrolled listbox with additional options to manage
horizontal and vertical scrollbars.  This includes options to control
which scrollbars are displayed and the method, i.e. statically or
dynamically.

.SH "METHODS"
.PP
The \fBiwidgets::scrolledlistbox\fR command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is \fIpathName\fR.  This
command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
.DS C
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.DE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behavior of the command.
.PP
Many of the widget commands for a scrolledlistbox take as one argument an
indicator of which entry of the list box to operate on.  These
indicators are called \fIindex\fRes and may be specified in
any of the following forms:
.TP 12
\fInumber\fR
Specifies the element as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds
to the first element in the listbox.
.TP 12
\fBactive\fR
Indicates the element that has the location cursor.  This element
will be displayed with an underline when the listbox has the
keyboard focus, and it is specified with the \fBactivate\fR
widget command.
.TP 12
\fBanchor\fR
Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the
\fBselection anchor\fR widget command.
.TP 12
\fBend\fR
Indicates the end of the listbox.
For some commands this means just after the last element;
for other commands it means the last element.
.TP 12
\fB@\fIx\fB,\fIy\fR
Indicates the element that covers the point in the listbox window
specified by \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR (in pixel coordinates).  If no
element covers that point, then the closest element to that
point is used.
.TP 12
\fIpattern\fR
If the index doesn't satisfy one of the above forms then this
form is used.  \fIPattern\fR is pattern-matched against the items in
the list box, in order from the top down, until a matching entry is found.
The rules of \fBTcl_StringMatch\fR are used.
.PP
The following widget commands are possible for scrolledlistbox widgets:

.SH "WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS"
.TP
\fIpathName \fBcget\fR \fIoption\fR
Returns the current value of the configuration option given
by \fIoption\fR.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \fBiwidgets::scrolledlistbox\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBclear\fR
Clears the listbox of all items.
.TP
\fIpathName\fR \fBconfigure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? ?\fIvalue option value ...\fR?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.
If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list describing all of
the available options for \fIpathName\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list).  If \fIoption\fR is specified
with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no \fIoption\fR is specified).  If
one or more \fIoption\-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in
this case the command returns an empty string.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \fBiwidgets::scrolledlistbox\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBgetcurselection\fR
Returns the contents of the listbox element indicated by the current
selection indexes.  Short cut version of get and curselection command
combination.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBjustify \fIdirection\fR
Justifies the list contents via teh scroll bars in one of four directions:
\fBleft\fR, \fBright\fR, \fBtop\fR, or \fBbottom\fR.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBselecteditemcount\fR
Returns the number of items currently selected in the list.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBsort\fR \fIorder\fR
Sort the current list in any of the forms accepted by Tcl's lsort command.
Also accepts either \fBascending\fR or \fBdescending\fR order.
