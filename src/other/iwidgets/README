 Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [incr Widgets] is an object-oriented mega-widget set which extends 
 Tcl/Tk and is based on [incr Tcl] and [incr Tk].  This set of mega-widgets
 delivers many new, general purpose widgets like option menus, comboboxes, 
 selection boxes, and various dialogs whose couterparts are found in Motif 
 and Windows. Since [incr Widgets] is based on the [incr Tk] extension, the 
 Tk framework of configuration options, widget commands, and default bindings
 is maintained.  In other words, each [incr Widgets] mega-widget seamlessly 
 blends with the standard Tk widgets. They look, act and feel like Tk 
 widgets. In addition, all [incr Widgets] mega-widgets are object oriented and 
 may themselves be extended, using either inheritance or composition.

 [incr Widgets] offers a strong object-oriented foundation which addresses 
 the need for a flexible and extensible mega-widget set. Its usage replaces 
 common widget combinations with higher level abstractions, simplifying code,
 reducing errors, increasing readability, adding productivity, and promoting 
 a singular look-and-feel.  The ability to extend [incr Widgets] enables 
 developers to create new mega-widgets based on previous work.

 In short, [incr Widgets] is a library of reusable mega-widgets that can 
 be easily extended using composition or inheritance, allowing quicker 
 development of large scale applications. Usage drastically reduces 
 development time. New dialogs can be created in hours. Whole applications 
 in a few days. Reuse becomes a reality. Many projects are benefitting frm
 the intergration of this mega-widget set into their development strategy. 
 [incr Widgets] is an [incr Tcl] and [incr Tk] success story. Good products 
 come from good foundations.


 Distribution
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The [incr Widgets] distribution may be downloaded at SourceForge:
 www.sourceforge.net/projects/incrtcl.  The current distribution is
 version 4.0.2.


 Web site
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 For the most current news regarding [incr Widgets] please consult the web
 site - http://incrtcl.sourceforge.net/iwidgets.  Many thanks to Brett Schwarz
 who has done an incredible job overhauling this site.  Take a look!
  

 Getting started
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The "doc" directory contains man pages and a technical paper. The man
 pages are installed under the man directory off your --prefix, and as of
 version 4.0.1 are prepended with the text "iwidgets_" to easily differentiate
 [incr Widgets] man pages from those of other extensions.

   doc/iwidgets.ps ... Updated paper presented at Tcl Workshop 95.

   doc/*.n ........... Man pages

 The "demos" directory contains demo scripts for each mega-widget as
 well as html versions of all the [incr Widgets] man pages.  The
 demos are also installed under the lib directory off your --prefix.

   demos/catalog ..... Comprehensive demo package which illustrates
                       [incr Widgets] usage additionally displaying the 
                       source.

   demos/html    ..... HTML version of the [incr Widgets] man pages.

 The "tests" directory contains a set of test scripts for [incr Widgets].
 They also make for a great demo of the flexiblity of the mega-widgets.


 Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE: Having the itcl distribution is a prerequsite to using iwidgets.
  Thus, if you don't have itcl you need to visit Source Forge to download
  and install it first.  Once you have downloaded and installed [incr Tcl]
  and [incr Tk], you can proceed with [incr Widgets] installation as follows:

  1)  Copy the iwidgets4.0.2.tar.gz file to your toplevel [incr Tcl]
      directory.  For example, if you have the itcl3.2.1 distribution in
      a directory named /usr/local/tcl/itcl3.2.1, then you should copy
      the iwidgets file to this directory.

      Note, if you don't copy the iwidgets archive to this directory,
      then you will need to specify the --with-itcl flag when you run
      the configure script.

  2)  Untar/unzip the archive:

	gunzip -c iwidgets4.0.2.tar.gz |tar xvf -

  3)  Run the configuration script:

        cd iwidgets4.0.0
        ./configure

      By default, the configuration script will set things up to be
      installed in "/usr/local".  You can change this by specifying a
      different "prefix" in the "configure" command.  You'll want to
      use the same value you used for the prefix in the configuration
      of your [incr Tcl/Tk] distribution.

        ./configure --prefix=/your/install/path

      The "configure" script generates a Makefile from the Makefile.in
      template.

      Also, as mentioned eariler, you may need to tell the [incr Widgets]
      where the [incr Tcl] source is located.  For example, if your toplevel
      [incr Tcl] directory is located in /opt/tools/tcl/itcl3.2.1 and you
      are building the [incr Widgets] in a directory other than this, then
      you will need to use the following:

	./configure --prefix=/your/install/path \
	  --with-itcl=/opt/tools/tcl/itcl3.2.1

  4)  Run the test suite:

        make test

  7)  Install the [incr Widgets] man pages, demos, and script files.

        make install
