  1. (done) Add timeout option to control how long to search for application 
            window.

graph
  1. (done) Fix zooming graph procedure to handle multiple axes.
  2. (BUG) Windows printing commands "print1" and "print2" need to use 
     postscript options like -maxpect, -pad, etc. to control graph
     size.
  3. (BUG) No PostScript generated for polygon tiling.
  4. (BUG) Clip background polygon for text/bitmap markers.
  5. (FEATURE) Add -mask option for bitmap marker.

  9. (BUG) Finish adding error bars.
 10. (DOC) Review and update documentation for new typos, new features.
 11. (BUG) Store converted screen coordinates in floating point. Can't
	   use integer coordinates for higher resolution PostScript
	   devices. How do Windows' print devices handle this?

hierbox
  1. (CHANGE) Hierbox to use tree object for data.  The -data option will 
              be a field in the tree.

hiertable
  1. (done) -tree option dumps core.
  2. (done) Sorting tree view affects all other hiertables using the tree.  
            Is separate data structure needed for non-flattened sorts?  What
            about moves? 
  3. (done) Call tree update procedure when tree object is sorted.  This
            is only when a tree is shared between more than one hiertable.
            It goes out-of-sync with actual tree positions.
  4. (CHANGE) "column resize set" should change the width of the active

	           This will affect lots of code.
 14. (PERFORMANCE) Don't redraw entire widget for selections.  Draw
