# The following logic is what allows binaries to run successfully in
# the build directory AND install directory.  Thanks to plplot for
# identifying the necessity of setting CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR on OSX.
# Documentation of these options is available at
# http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_RPATH_handling

# use, i.e. don't skip the full RPATH for the build tree
set(CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH FALSE)

# when building, don't use the install RPATH already
# (but later on when installing)
set(CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH FALSE)

# the RPATH/INSTALL_NAME_DIR to be used when installing
if (NOT APPLE)
  set(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/${LIB_DIR}:\$ORIGIN/../${LIB_DIR}")
endif(NOT APPLE)
# On OSX, we need to set INSTALL_NAME_DIR instead of RPATH
# http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake-2-8-docs.html#variable:CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
set(CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/${LIB_DIR}")

# add the automatically determined parts of the RPATH which point to
# directories outside the build tree to the install RPATH
set(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH TRUE)

# Local Variables:
# tab-width: 8
# mode: cmake
# indent-tabs-mode: t
# End:
# ex: shiftwidth=2 tabstop=8
