These are recommendations, not all of the same priority, and not
all necessarily will be implemented.  If you see something you
feel is important, email me and say so.  Very democratic.

* some sort of textbbox command that will return the size of the
  text in a cell, to allow for perfect cell sizing.

* anchor title areas in different parts of the screen

* -rowstretchmode fill ignores initial # of rows, or config requests for more.
* interpret 0 rows/cols to be FILL
* add -colstretchmode fill
* scratch stretchmode "fill" in favor of "dynamic" which would monitor
  the max extent of row/col (difficult)

* fix selection routines to properly handle title area movement

* support smooth scrolling of rows/cols
 
* add ability to index by tagname
* overhaul tag mechanism (include way to query for tags on a cell, add
  priority)

* add internal sort procedures
pathName  sort	-row	{the list of rows we want to sort | all}
		-col	{the list of cols we use for sorting}
		-master row,col
		-command _command_to_use_
		-type	{for each column specifies the type of sort:
			ascii | dictionary | integer | real }
		-order	{for each column specify the order of sort:
			increasing | decreasing | none }

* row/column swap (maybe only in terms of visual remapping)

=	BBBB  U   U  GGG   SSS
==	B   B U   U G     S  
==-	B BB  U   U G GGG  SSS
==	B   B U   U G   G     S
=	BBBB   UUU   GGGG  SSS

MINOR:

Windows: With "-colstretchmode last", the scrollbar behaves oddly in
	handling the space for the last cell properly when moving the
	main part of the scrollbar with the mouse.  This seems to be
	that even though the scrollbar receives the "set 0.6xxx 1",
	the scrollbar immediately jumps back to what the mouse says,
	although this isn't a problem in X...

Windows: when moving windows in "Show Window While Dragging" mode,
	the column titles don't refresh properly.

Windows: When using bitmaps in cells, they occasionally don't redraw
	 correctly.  The work-around is to use -drawmode slow.
