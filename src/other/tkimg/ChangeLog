2004-08-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* ico/ico.c: The last change made to these files, not
	* sun/sun.c: recorded in the ChangeLog [*], caused them to
	* sgi/sgi.c: be stored back into the CVS in DOS format.
	* tga/tga.c: This screwed up the compile, more precise,
	* pcx/pcx.c: the continuation lines in the code were not
	             recognized anymore.

	[*] cvs annotate claims that the change was made on July 27.

2004-06-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* base/tkimgPPB.c:
	* base/tkimg.h: Added conditional definition for Tk_PhotoExpand
	* bmp/bmp.c:    (named tkimg_PhotoExpand). Changed all occurences
	* gif/gif.c:    if Tk_PhotoExpand to the new definition. This
	* ico/ico.c:    takes care of a change between Tk 8.4 and 8.5
	* jpeg/jpeg.c:
	* libjpeg/tcl/jpegtcl.c:
	* pcx/pcx.c:

	* doc/img-ps.man: Fix of typo reported by doctools.

2003-03-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* doc/img-ps.man: Extended with a section about requirements,
	  because this format relies on the presence of 'gs'
	  (ghostscript).

2003-03-09  Paul Obermeier  <obermeier@poSoft.de>

	* pcx/pcx.c: Fixed incorrect usage of Tcl_AppendResult, 
	* sun/sun.c: which could cause core dumps.
	* tga/tga.c:

	* pcx/pcx.c: Improved heuristics for better format matching.

	* base/pkgIndex.tcl.in: Rearranged order of required packages

	* doc/format-footer.inc: Better see-also and keywording.
	* doc/img-ps.man:
	* doc/img.man: 

	* doc/img-png.man: Small fix in manpage, command was broken over
	  two lines, which is illegal.

2003-02-26  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* configure:    Fixed hangup on Linux systems where arguments
	* configure.in: to cc in the variable CC caused the subordinate
	                configure of tiff to choke (A which command
			hanged itself).

	* bmp/tests/bmp.test:   Updated the testsuite to use the new 'img::*'
	* gif/tests/gif.test:   package names instead of the old 'tkimg::*'.
	* ico/tests/ico.test:   Thanks to Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

2003-02-12  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README: Removed format documentation from the file. Added
	  reference to manpages, and doctools.

	* Completed documentation work.

2003-02-06  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/img.man:     Started to work on new user documentation.
	* doc/img-bmp.man: Using the doctools format for easy writing
	* doc/img-gif.man: and easy conversion to other formats.
	* doc/img-ico.man: 
	* doc/img-jpeg.man:   Given the uniformity of most of the
	* doc/img-pcx.man:    handlers a template system is used
	* doc/img-pixmap.man: (doctools extended to handle [include]
	* doc/img-png.man:    files, and allow parameterization through

	* doc/format-middle.inc:


2003-01-23  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Touched all sub-modules, added -I/path/to/sources/of/module/base
	  so that they are able to find the tkimg.h header even if base is
	  not installed yet. Same principle as for access to the jpegtcl,
	  etc. headers.

2003-01-21  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure:    Fixed [Tkimg bug 655408] reported by Heinz-Detlev
	* configure.in: Koch <hdkoch@users.sourceforge.net>. The change in
	* Makefile.in:  aclocal.m4 fixing the problem with the propagation
	                of options to the sub-configure files also allows
	                us to use a simple 'make all' when compiling the
	                individual modules. Installation is not required
	                for them to find their requirements. Removed the
	                macro AC_PREFIX_PROGRAM(tclsh) and subsequent
	                conditionals from the master configure.in. We have
	                no need of special code for --prefix /
	                --exec-prefix in the master. The standard code
	                supplied by autoconf itself is just
	                fine. Regenerated the configure file.

2003-01-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* aclocal.m4: Added this file, was missing. Fixed bug in
	  TEA_CONFIG_COLLECT.

2002-12-09  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in:
	* configure:
	* aclocal.m4:
	* Makefile.in: New master files for building all packages in
	  the extension. The installation collects all shared libraries in
	  one directory, using a big package index file for all packages.

	* base/: configure.in: Added DPACKAGE, is now 'img::base' instead
	  of 'tkimg'.

	* bmp, gif, ico, jpeg, pcx, pixmap, png, ppm, ps, sgi, sun, tga,
	  tiff, window, xbm, xpm:
	  Changed 'tkimg::' to 'img::'

2002-12-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* bmp:
	* gif:
	* jpeg:
	* png:
	* tiff:
	* xpm:
	* xbm: Created testsuites for these handlers. Essentially the
	  existing big testsuite was split into per handler
	  testsuites. All pass.

	* sun:
	* sgi:
	* ico:
	* pcx:
	* ppm:
	* tga: Added testsuites, templated upon the original ones.

	  SGI has trouble. What goes in, does not come out exactly the
	  same. I am not sure if there is a bug, or if there is some
	  intentional change made by the handler.

	* ps: (+pdf)
	* window:
	* pixmap: Without testsuites.

	* init.c (_Init): Had to be changed to use '1.3' too.

	* libjpeg/tcl:
	* libpng/tcl:
	* libz/tcl:
	* libtiff/tcl:
	* base:

	  Weeded out discrepancies in definition versus usage of BUILD_xxx
	  macros controlling DLLEXPORT / DLLIMPORT on windows. The
	  capitalization in configure(.in) and header was different.

2002-11-28  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ps/: New directory, PS + PDF handler (photo image types).

	* png/: New directory, PNG handler (photo image types).

	* tiff/: New directory, TIFF handler (photo image types).

	* window/: New directory, WINDOW handler (photo image
	  type). Conversion of the original Img sources to TEA 2 provided
	  by Paul Obermeier <obermeier@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* xpm/: New directory, XPM handler (photo image type). Conversion
	  of the original Img sources to TEA 2 provided by Paul Obermeier
	  <obermeier@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* xbm/: New directory, XBM handler (photo image type). Conversion
	  of the original Img sources to TEA 2 provided by Paul Obermeier
	  <obermeier@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* tga/: New directory, TGA handler (photo image type). Code
	  provided by Paul Obermeier <obermeier@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* sun/: New directory, SUN handler (photo image type). Code
	  provided by Paul Obermeier <obermeier@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* sgi/: New directory, SGI handler (photo image type). Code
	  provided by Paul Obermeier <obermeier@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* ppm/: New directory, PPM handler (photo image type). Code
	  provided by Paul Obermeier <obermeier@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* pcx/: New directory, PCX handler (photo image type). Code
	  provided by Paul Obermeier <obermeier@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* ico/: New directory, ICO handler (photo image type). Code
	  provided by Paul Obermeier <obermeier@users.sourceforge.net>.

2002-11-26  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c: Extended to allow registration of a second format. This
	  format is able to share functions with the first one. Current
	  user for this feature: The ps/pdf combo handler.

2002-11-19  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* init.c: New file. Contains generic initialization code for a
	  photo image type. Parameterized by the individual format
	  handlers with the package name (in various forms). First user is
	  'tkimg::bmp'.

	* bmp/: New directory, BMP handler (photo image type).
	* gif/: s.a, GIF handler (photo image type).
	* jpeg/: s.a, JPEG handler (photo image type).

2002-11-18  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* base: New directory. Base package for format handlers to draw
	  upon. Build system based on TEA 2. Exports a stub table. The
	  source code is a modified copy of the relevant sources in the
	  main directory, making this package completely independent of
	  the existing sources.

2002-11-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* libz/tcl:
	* libpng/tcl:
	* libjpeg/tcl:
	* libtiff/tcl: New directories, tcl packages wrapping around the
	  support libraries, exporting their functionality via a stub
	  table. Based on TEA 2. First step in the reorganization of the
	  whole code base for easier configuration and building. The code
	  of the support libraries is linked directly into the wrapper
	  libraries. This means that the wrappers do not use support
	  libraries installed on the system. Support for this will come at
	  a later stage.

	* libpng/png.c: Added casts to prevent compiler error.
	* imgInt.h: Fixed small typo.

2002-10-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* configure.in: Changed to propagate an initial CFLAGS value to
	  the final definition. A TEA condition (SHARED_BUILD == 1)
	  squashed it, causing it the build system to loose the
	  +DAportable we specify for the AS PA-RISC2.2 build host. This is
	  a problem for _all_ TEA and TEA 2 based configure files.

2002-10-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* libjpeg/configure:
	* libtiff/tiff.h:
	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:
	* imgTIFF.c: Folding a number of band-aid patches to make tkImg
	  compile on the ActiveState hosts back into the sources.

	  When using gcc have to link -lgcc into the main, png, and tiff
	  libraries. Have to propagate host specification to subordniate
	  configure scripts. Have to explicitly link in '-lm -lc' on
	  AIX. Disable a number of typedef's in the TIFF code which are
	  provided by AIX headers. Avoid unwanted usage of the memcpy
	  macro on AIX.

2002-09-25  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in: better use of libdir. Add jpegconfdir to includes.
	Add srcdir prefix for installation of *.tcl. (steffen)

	* configure: regen'd
	* configure.in: add support for --with-tcl|tkinclude (steffen)

	* imgUnixPmap.c: #define XPutImage to empty for OSX. (steffen)

	* imgWindow.c: include X libs for OSX. (steffen)

2002-06-19  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* imgTIFF.c: Ifdef'd code choosing either stdarg.h or
	  varargs.h. The Tcl header does this selection since 8.1., and in
	  8.4 it has changed significantly, causing the code here to
	  select a different file than tcl itself, causing compile
	  problems. Thanks to Joe English for his help in tracking this
	  down.

2002-06-17  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* imgBMP.c (CommonReadBMP): 
	* imgGIF.c (CommonReadGIF): 
	* imgJPEG.c (CommonReadJPEG): 
	* imgPS.c (ChanReadPDF): 
	* imgWindow.c (ObjReadWin): 
	* imgXPM.c (CommonReadXPM): 
	* imgUtil.c (ImgPhotoPutBlock): Updated to handle changes
	  introduced into Tk by TIP #98.

2002-05-27  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tools/install.tcl: Fixed mismatched brackets.
