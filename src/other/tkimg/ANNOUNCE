I'm happy to announce version 1.3 of the "tkImg" package
(formerly known as 'Img").

This package enhances Tk, adding support for many other Image formats.

Changes compared to version 1.2.4:

-	New formats: ICO, PCX, PPM, SGI, SUN, TGA.
-	New build system, based upon TEA 2.
-	Refactored into several smaler and more independent
	packages. See file README in the (source) distributions for
	more information.
-	Bug fixes and enhancements in some formats.

This version only works with Tcl/Tk 8.0 or higher (tested up to
8.4a1). If you are using Tk4.2 or lower, please stick with Img1.1.4
(which is still available).

Currently there are two identical source distributions:
	tkimg13.zip             (for Windows)	(about 2.9 Mb)
	tkimg1.3.tar.gz         (for Unix)	(about 2.6 Mb)
	tkimg1.3.tar.bz2        (for Unix)	(about 1.7 Mb)

All these files can be downloaded from:
	http://source.net/project/tkimg/

The most recent info is always available at:
	http://source.net/project/tkimg/

See the README on how to build and use the packages.

If you want to write images to disk which contain transparency
information (e.g. GIF89 or PNG with alpha channel), you need
at least Tk 8.3. Without lower Tk versions only GIF87 will be
written, and the alpha channel will be missing from PNG files. In
other words: The background color will not be as intended but
everything else should be O.K.

For PNG, JPEG and TIFF support the supporting packages have to be
build and installed. See the file README for more in-depth
explanations.

For postscript you need Ghostscript (version 2.6 or higher) to be
available on your system.
