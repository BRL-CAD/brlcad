CVS checkout: cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@tkhtml.tcl.tk:/tkhtml checkout htmlwidget
Date of last BRL-CAD update: 10/07/2008 

Changes include using directory named tkhtml instead of htmlwidget,
not using tkhtml's make logic, and not including any of the test code.
Only the tkhtml widget itself is included, not the hv browser code.

The top-level Makefile.in file was converted to Makefile.am and
modified to create a libtool library.

The scripts that generate source files (src/*.tcl) were updated to
generate sources in the correct location compatible with out-of-dir
building.

This build of Tkhtml incorporates files which are generated using
tclsh in the main Tkhtml build.  In order to better work with
BRL-CAD's existing build mechanisms, the following files are manually
generated and updated when Tkhtml is updated:


* Generated in the original distribution by the 
  command "tclsh src/cssprop.tcl":

  include/cssprop.h
  src/cssprop.c


* Generated in the original distribution by the 
  command "tclsh src/tokenlist.txt":

  include/htmltokens.h
  src/htmltokens.c


* Generated in the original distribution by the 
  command "tclsh src/mkdefaultstyle.tcl > htmldefaultstyle.c":

  src/htmldefaultstyle.c
