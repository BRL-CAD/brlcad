This is an extraction of the Mesa 3-D library's software rasterizer and
offscreen rendering implementation of OpenGL 2.1 style APIs.  For ease
of setup and compilation, the 7.0.4 release of Mesa was used as a basis.
(This fork is not affiliated with the Mesa project - for the modern
implementation see https://mesa3d.org)

The goals of this particular fork are NOT speed, but rather a portable,
reliable cross platform rendering method that does not require any outside
support from the OS or graphics hardware.  The idea is to guarantee an
application's ability to produce scene rasterizations as images even when the
primary graphics stack of the machine is unavailable.

Changes are (or at least are intended to be) relatively minor and include
things like updating header includes to avoid accidentally including system
versions of gl.h.  CPU/platform specific optimizations are removed in favor
of portable code.
