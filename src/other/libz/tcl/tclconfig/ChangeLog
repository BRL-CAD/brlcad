	* tcl.m4: Added MINGW32 to list of systems checked for Windows build.
	Also, fixes some indentation issues with "--with-XXX" options.

2002-04-23  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_ENABLE_THREADS): added USE_THREAD_ALLOC define to
	use new threaded allocatory by default on Unix for Tcl 8.4.
	(TEA_CONFIG_CFLAGS): corrected LD_SEARCH_FLAGS for FreeBSD-3+.

2002-04-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_SETUP_COMPILER): removed call to AC_CYGWIN so that
	we can use autoconf 2.5x as well as 2.13.  This prevents us from
	being able to warn against the use of cygwin gcc at configure
	time, but allows autoconf 2.5x, which is what is shipped with most
	newer systems.

2002-04-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: Enabled COFF as well as CV style debug info with
	--enable-symbols to allow Dr. Watson users to see function info.
	More info on debugging levels can be obtained at:
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnvc60/html/gendepdebug.asp

2002-04-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: change all SC_* macros to TEA_*.  The SC_ was for
	Scriptics, which is no more.  TEA represents a better, independent
	prefix that won't need changing.
	Added preliminary mingw gcc support. [Patch #538772]
	Added TEA_PREFIX macro that handles defaulting the prefix and
	exec_prefix vars to those used by Tcl if none were specified.
	Added TEA_SETUP_COMPILER macro that encompasses the AC_PROG_CC
	check and several other basic AC_PROG checks needed for making
	executables.  This greatly simplifies user's configure.in files.
	Collapsed AIX-5 defines into AIX-* with extra checks for doing the
	ELF stuff on AIX-5-ia64.
	Updated TEA_ENABLE_THREADS to take an optional arg to allow
	switching it on by default (for Thread) and add sanity checking to
	warn the user if configuring threads incompatibly.

2002-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: made sure that SHLIB_LDFLAGS was set to LDFLAGS_DEFAULT.
	Removed --enable-64bit support for AIX-4 because it wasn't correct.
	Added -MT or -MD Windows linker switches to properly support
	symbols-enabled builds.

2002-03-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: called AC_MSG_ERROR when SC_TEA_INIT wasn't called first
	instead of calling it as that inlines it each time in shell code.
	Changed Windows CFLAGS_OPTIMIZE to use -O2 instead of -Oti.
	Noted TCL_LIB_VERSIONS_OK=nodots for Windows builds.
	A few changes to support itcl (and perhaps others):
	Added support for making your own stub libraries to SC_MAKE_LIB.
	New SC_PATH_CONFIG and SC_LOAD_CONFIG that take a package name arg
	and find that ${pkg}Config.sh file.  itk uses this for itcl.

2002-03-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: made SC_LOAD_TKCONFIG recognize when working with a Tk
	build dir setup.
	Added EXTRA_CFLAGS and SHLIB_LD_LIBS substs to SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS.
	Added XLIBSW onto LIBS when it is defined.
	Remove TCL_LIBS from MAKE_LIB and correctly use SHLIB_LD_LIBS
	instead to not rely as much on tclConfig.sh cached info.
	Add TK_BIN_DIR to paths to find wish in SC_PROG_WISH.
	These move towards making TEA much more independent of *Config.sh.

2002-03-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: corrected forgotten (UN)SHARED_LIB_SUFFIX and
	SHLIB_SUFFIX defines for Win.
	(SC_PATH_X): made this only do the check on unix platforms. 

2002-03-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README.txt: updated to reflect fewer files

2002-03-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* config.guess (removed):
	* config.sub (removed): removed unnecessary files

	* installFile.tcl (removed):
	* mkinstalldirs (removed): these aren't really necessary for
	making TEA work

	* tcl.m4 (SC_PUBLIC_TCL_HEADERS, SC_PUBLIC_TK_HEADERS): don't
	check /usr(/local)/include for includes on Windows when not using
	gcc

2002-03-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: added warnings on Windows, removed RELPATH define and
	added TCL_LIBS to MAKE_LIB macro.

	This import represents 2.0.0, or a new start at attempting to
	make TEA much easier for C extension developers.

	**** moved from tclpro project to core tcl project, ****
	**** renamed to 'tclconfig'                         ****

2001-03-15    Karl Lehenbauer <karl@procplace.com>

	* installFile.tcl: Added updating of the modification time of
	  the target file whether we overwrote it or decided that it
	  hadn't changed.  This was necessary for us to be able to
	  determine whether or not a module install touched the file.

2001-03-08    Karl Lehenbauer <karl@procplace.com>

	* installFile.tcl: Added support for converting new-style (1.1+) 
	  Cygnus drive paths to Tcl-style.

2001-01-15    <brent.welch@interwoven.com>

	* tcl.m4: Added FreeBSD clause.

2001-01-03    <brent.welch@interwoven.com>

	* tcl.m4: Fixed typo in SC_LIB_SPEC where it is checking
	for exec-prefix.

2000-12-01    <brent.welch@interwoven.com>

	* tcl.m4: Concatenated most of the Ajuba acsite.m4 file
	so we don't need to modify the autoconf installation.
	* config.guess:
	* config.sub:
	* installFile.tcl:
	Added files from the itcl config subdirectory,
	which should go away.

2000-7-29    <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Fixed the use of TCL_SRC_DIR and TK_SRC_DIR within
	TCL_PRIVATE_INCLUDES and TK_PRIVATE_INCLUDES to match their recent
	change from $(srcdir) to $(srcdir)/..
