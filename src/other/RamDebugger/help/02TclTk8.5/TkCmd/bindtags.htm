bindtags - Determine which bindings apply to a window, and order of evaluation
<H3><A NAME="M3">SYNOPSIS</A></H3>
<B>bindtags </B><I>window </I>?<I>tagList</I>?<BR>
<H3><A NAME="M4">DESCRIPTION</A></H3>
When a binding is created with the <B><A HREF="../TkCmd/bind.htm">bind</A></B> command, it is
associated either with a particular window such as <B>.a.b.c</B>,
a class name such as <B><A HREF="../TkCmd/button.htm">Button</A></B>, the keyword <B>all</B>, or any
other string.
All of these forms are called <I>binding tags</I>.
Each window contains a list of binding tags that determine how
events are processed for the window.
When an event occurs in a window, it is applied to each of the
window's tags in order:  for each tag, the most specific binding
that matches the given tag and event is executed.
See the <B><A HREF="../TkCmd/bind.htm">bind</A></B> command for more information on the matching
process.
<P>
By default, each window has four binding tags consisting of the
name of the window, the window's class name, the name of the window's
nearest toplevel ancestor, and <B>all</B>, in that order.
Toplevel windows have only three tags by default, since the toplevel
name is the same as that of the window.
The <B>bindtags</B> command allows the binding tags for a window to be
read and modified.
<P>
If <B>bindtags</B> is invoked with only one argument, then the
current set of binding tags for <I>window</I> is returned as a list.
If the <I>tagList</I> argument is specified to <B>bindtags</B>,
then it must be a proper list; the tags for <I>window</I> are changed
to the elements of the list.
The elements of <I>tagList</I> may be arbitrary strings;  however,
any tag starting with a dot is treated as the name of a window;  if
no window by that name exists at the time an event is processed,
then the tag is ignored for that event.
The order of the elements in <I>tagList</I> determines the order in
which binding scripts are executed in response to events.
For example, the command
<PRE><B>bindtags .b {all . Button .b}</B></PRE>
reverses the order in which binding scripts will be evaluated for
a button named <B>.b</B> so that <B>all</B> bindings are invoked
first, following by bindings for <B>.b</B>'s toplevel
(&#8220;.&#8221;),
followed by class bindings, followed by bindings for <B>.b</B>.
If <I>tagList</I> is an empty list then the binding tags for <I>window</I>
are returned to the default state described above.
<P>
The <B>bindtags</B> command may be used to introduce arbitrary
additional binding tags for a window, or to remove standard tags.
For example, the command
<PRE><B>bindtags .b {.b TrickyButton . all}</B></PRE>
replaces the <B><A HREF="../TkCmd/button.htm">Button</A></B> tag for <B>.b</B> with <B>TrickyButton</B>.
This means that the default widget bindings for buttons, which are
associated with the <B><A HREF="../TkCmd/button.htm">Button</A></B> tag, will no longer apply to <B>.b</B>,
but any bindings associated with <B>TrickyButton</B> (perhaps some
new button behavior) will apply.
<H3><A NAME="M5">EXAMPLE</A></H3>
If you have a set of nested <B><A HREF="../TkCmd/frame.htm">frame</A></B> widgets and you want events
sent to a <B><A HREF="../TkCmd/button.htm">button</A></B> widget to also be delivered to all the widgets
up to the current <B><A HREF="../TkCmd/toplevel.htm">toplevel</A></B> (in contrast to Tk's default
behavior, where events are not delivered to those intermediate
windows) to make it easier to have accelerators that are only active
for part of a window, you could use a helper procedure like this to
help set things up:
<PRE>proc setupBindtagsForTreeDelivery {widget} {
    set tags [list $widget [winfo class $widget]]
    set w $widget
    set t [winfo toplevel $w]
    while {$w ne $t} {
        set w [winfo parent $w]
        lappend tags $w
    }
    lappend tags all
    <B>bindtags</B> $widget $tags
}</PRE>
