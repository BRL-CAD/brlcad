[description]

This package allows scrollbars to be mapped and
unmapped as needed depending on the size and
content of the scrollbars scrolled widget. The
scrollbar must be managed by either pack or grid,
other geometry managers are not supported.

[para]

When managed by pack, any geometry changes made in the
scrollbars parent between the time a scrollbar is
unmapped, and when it is mapped will be lost. It is
an error to destroy any of the scrollbars siblings while the
scrollbar is unmapped. When managed by grid, if anything
becomes gridded in the same row and column the scrollbar
occupied it will be replaced by the scrollbar when remapped.

[para]

This package may be used on any scrollbar-like widget
as long as it supports the [const set] subcommand in the same
style as scrollbar. If the [const set] subcommand is not used
then this package will have no effect.
