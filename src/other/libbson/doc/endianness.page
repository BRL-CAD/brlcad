  <title>Endian Concerns</title>
  <p>The BSON specification dictates that the encoding format is in little-endian. Many implementations simply ignore endianess altogether and expect that they are to be run on little-endian. Libbson supports both Big and Little Endian systems. This means we use <code>memcpy()</code> when appropriate instead of dereferencing and properly convert to and from the hoste endian format. We expect the compiler intrinstics to optimize it to a dereference when possible.</p>
