This directory contains pre-generated outputs from
the Perplex/RE2C/Lemon toolchain.  Their purpose
is to allow SCL to build on platforms that do not
have those tools installed, when users/developers
do not need to alter the lexing and parsing logic.

DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES.  They are machine generated
and should not be modified directly - bugs in these
files need to be fixed in either the Perplex/RE2C/Lemon
input files or the tools themselves.  Directly changing
these files will result in a build failure.

If changes need to be made, the correct approach is to
install Perplex, RE2C, and Lemon and make changes in the
input files and/or tools.  As long as the toolchain in place
is the same as that used previously when generating these
files, the contents of this directory will be kept in sync 
automatically.  In the case of updates to the tools, use the 
express-sync-generated-files build target to force an
update.

The verification_info.cmake file in this directory is 
used by CMake to protect the integrity of the generated 
files.
