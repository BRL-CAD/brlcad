.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_SetGrid\fR turns on gridded geometry management for \fItkwin\fR's
toplevel window and specifies the geometry of the grid.
\fBTk_SetGrid\fR is typically invoked by a widget when its \fBsetGrid\fR
option is true.
It restricts interactive resizing of \fItkwin\fR's toplevel window so
that the space allocated to the toplevel is equal to its requested
size plus or minus even multiples of \fIwidthInc\fR and \fIheightInc\fR.
Furthermore, the \fIreqWidth\fR and \fIreqHeight\fR values are
passed to the window manager so that it can report the window's
size in grid units during interactive resizes.
If \fItkwin\fR's configuration changes (e.g., the size of a grid unit
changes) then the widget should invoke \fBTk_SetGrid\fR again with the new
information.
.PP
\fBTk_UnsetGrid\fR cancels gridded geometry management for
\fItkwin\fR's toplevel window.
.PP
For each toplevel window there can be at most one internal window
with gridding enabled.
If \fBTk_SetGrid\fR or \fBTk_UnsetGrid\fR is invoked when some
other window is already controlling gridding for \fItkwin\fR's
toplevel, the calls for the new window have no effect.
.PP
See the \fBwm\fR manual entry for additional information on gridded geometry
management.
