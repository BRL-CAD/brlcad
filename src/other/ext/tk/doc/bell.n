.SH NAME
bell \- Ring a display's bell
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbell \fR?\fB\-displayof \fIwindow\fR? ?\fB\-nice\fR?
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command rings the bell on the display for \fIwindow\fR and
returns an empty string.
If the \fB\-displayof\fR option is omitted, the display of the
application's main window is used by default.
The command uses the current bell-related settings for the display, which
may be modified with programs such as \fBxset\fR.
.PP
If \fB\-nice\fR is not specified, this command also resets the screen saver
for the screen.  Some screen savers will ignore this, but others will reset
so that the screen becomes visible again.
.SH KEYWORDS
beep, bell, ring
