.sp
\fBTk_FreeXId(\fIdisplay, id\fB)\fR
.SH ARGUMENTS

Display for which \fIid\fR was allocated.
.AP XID id in
Identifier of X resource (window, font, pixmap, cursor, graphics
context, or colormap) that is no longer in use.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The default allocator for resource identifiers provided by Xlib is very
simple-minded and does not allow resource identifiers to be re-used.
If a long-running application reaches the end of the resource id
space, it will generate an X protocol error and crash.
Tk replaces the default id allocator with its own allocator, which
allows identifiers to be reused.
In order for this to work, \fBTk_FreeXId\fR must be called to
tell the allocator about resources that have been freed.
Tk automatically calls \fBTk_FreeXId\fR whenever it frees a
resource, so if you use procedures like \fBTk_GetFont\fR,
\fBTk_GetGC\fR, and \fBTk_GetPixmap\fR then you need not call
\fBTk_FreeXId\fR.
However, if you allocate resources directly from Xlib, for example
by calling \fBXCreatePixmap\fR, then you should call \fBTk_FreeXId\fR
when you call the corresponding Xlib free procedure, such as
\fBXFreePixmap\fR.
If you do not call \fBTk_FreeXId\fR then the resource identifier will
be lost, which could cause problems if the application runs long enough
to lose all of the available identifiers.
