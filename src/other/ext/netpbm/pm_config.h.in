/* Switch macros like _POSIX_SOURCE are supposed to add features from
   the indicated standard to the C library.  A source file defines one
   of these macros to declare that it uses features of that standard
   as opposed to conflicting features of other standards (e.g. the
   POSIX foo() subroutine might do something different from the X/Open
   foo() subroutine).  Plus, this forces the coder to understand upon
   what feature sets his program relies.

   But some C library developers have misunderstood this and think of these
   macros like the old __ansi__ macro, which tells the C library, "Don't 
   have any features that aren't in the ANSI standard."  I.e. it's just
   the opposite -- the macro subtracts features instead of adding them.

   This means that on some platforms, Netpbm programs must define
   _POSIX_SOURCE, and on others, it must not.  Netpbm's POSIX_IS_IMPLIED 
   macro indicates that we're on a platform where we need not define
   _POSIX_SOURCE (and probably must not).

   The problematic C libraries treat _XOPEN_SOURCE the same way.
