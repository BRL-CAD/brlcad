# Settings for CMAKE_RPATH_BUILD that support custom manipulation of

# TODO - investigate using BUILD_RPATH and INSTALL_RPATH on a per
# target basis for more precise control (for example, when setting
# up paths for libs in subdirs...  not sure yet if it could be helpful
# but should be explored.

# Note in particular that BUILD_RPATH supports generator expressions,
# in case that's of use to pull other properties on which to base
# rpaths...

# Can use set_property:  https://stackoverflow.com/a/40147991

# To allow CMake to manipulate RPaths, we need to make sure they are all the
# same length and long enough to hold the longest candidate path we will need.
#
# NOTE: Since we haven't yet created any lib subdirectories that may be created
# by 3rd party builds, we can't check them for explicit length - for now, we
# use 20 as an upper bound on how long a directory name we might need there,
# but that will need to be updated in the event a more verbosely named library
# subdirectory shows up.
