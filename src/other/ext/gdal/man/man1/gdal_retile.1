.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This utility will retile a set of input tile(s). All the input tile(s) must
be georeferenced in the same coordinate system and have a matching number of bands.
Optionally pyramid levels are generated. It  is  possible to generate  shape file(s) for the tiled output.
.sp
If your number of input tiles exhausts the command line buffer, use the general
\fI\%\-\-optfile\fP option
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-targetDir <directory>
The directory where the tile result is created. Pyramids are stored
in  sub\-directories  numbered  from  1. Created tile names have a numbering
schema and contain the name of the source tiles(s)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-of <format>
Select the output format. Starting with GDAL 2.3, if not specified, the
format is guessed from the extension (previously was GTiff). Use the short
format name.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-co <NAME=VALUE>
Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the file created. For instance,
the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to control compression,
and whether the file should be tiled.
.sp
The creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the
\fI\%\-\-formats\fP
command line option but the documentation for the format is the
definitive source of information on driver creation options.
See \fI\%Raster drivers\fP format
specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-ot <type>
Force the output image bands to have a specific data type supported by the
driver, which may be one of the following: \fBByte\fP, \fBUInt16\fP,
\fBInt16\fP, \fBUInt32\fP, \fBInt32\fP, \fBFloat32\fP, \fBFloat64\fP, \fBCInt16\fP,
\fBCInt32\fP, \fBCFloat32\fP or \fBCFloat64\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-ps <pixelsize_x> <pixelsize_y>
Pixel size to be used for the
output file.  If not specified, 256 x 256 is the default
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-overlap< <val_in_pixel>
Overlap in pixels between consecutive tiles. If not specified, 0 is the default
.sp
New in version 2.2.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-levels <numberOfLevels>
Number of pyramids levels to build.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v
Generate verbose output of tile operations as they are done.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-pyramidOnly
No retiling, build only the pyramids
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r <algorithm>
Resampling algorithm, default is near
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s_srs <srs_def>
Source spatial reference to use. The coordinate systems  that  can  be
passed  are  anything  supported by the OGRSpatialReference.SetFromUserInput()  call,
which  includes  EPSG, PCS, and GCSes (i.e. EPSG:4296), PROJ.4 declarations (as above),
or the name of a .prj file containing well known text.
If  no  srs_def  is  given,  the srs_def  of the source tiles is used (if there is any).
The srs_def will be propagated to created tiles (if possible) and  to  the  optional
shape file(s)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-tileIndex <tileIndexName>
The name of shape file containing the result tile(s) index
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-tileIndexField <tileIndexFieldName>
The name of the attribute containing the tile name
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-csv <csvFileName>
The name of the csv file containing the tile(s) georeferencing information.
The file contains 5 columns: tilename,minx,maxx,miny,maxy
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-csvDelim <column delimiter>
The column delimiter used in the CSV file, default value is a semicolon ";"
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-useDirForEachRow
Normally the tiles of the base image are stored as described in \fI\%\-targetDir\fP\&.
For large images, some file systems have performance problems if the number of files
in a directory is to big, causing gdal_retile not to finish in reasonable time.
Using this parameter creates a different output structure. The tiles of the base image
are stored in a sub\-directory called 0, the pyramids in sub\-directories numbered 1,2,....
Within each of these directories another level of sub\-directories is created, numbered from
0...n, depending of how many tile rows are needed for each level. Finally, a directory contains
only the tiles for one row for a specific level. For large images a performance improvement
of a factor N could be achieved.

with Python support.
