.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBogr2ogr\fP can be used to convert simple features data between file
formats. It can also perform various operations during the process, such as
spatial or attribute selection, reducing the set of attributes, setting the
output coordinate system or even reprojecting the features during translation.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f <format_name>
Output file format name, e.g. \fBESRI Shapefile\fP, \fBMapInfo File\fP,
\fBPostgreSQL\fP\&.  Starting with GDAL 2.3, if not specified, the format is
guessed from the extension (previously was ESRI Shapefile).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-append
Append to existing layer instead of creating new
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-overwrite
Delete the output layer and recreate it empty
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-update
Open existing output datasource in update mode rather than trying to create
a new one
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-select <field_list>
Comma\-delimited list of fields from input layer to copy to the new layer. A
field is skipped if mentioned previously in the list even if the input
layer has duplicate field names. (Defaults to \fBall\fP; any field is skipped
if a subsequent field with same name is found.) Geometry fields can also be
specified in the list.
.sp
Note this setting cannot be used together with \fB\-append\fP\&. To control the
selection of fields when appending to a layer, use \fB\-fieldmap\fP or \fB\-sql\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-progress
Display progress on terminal. Only works if input layers have the "fast
feature count" capability.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-sql <sql_statement>
SQL statement to execute. The resulting table/layer will be saved to the
output. Starting with GDAL 2.1, the \fB@filename\fP syntax can be used to
indicate that the content is in the pointed filename.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-dialect <dialect>
SQL dialect. In some cases can be used to use (unoptimized) \fI\%OGR SQL dialect\fP instead
of the native SQL of an RDBMS by passing the \fBOGRSQL\fP dialect value.
The \fI\%SQL SQLite dialect\fP dialect can be select with the \fBSQLITE\fP
and \fBINDIRECT_SQLITE\fP dialect values, and this can be used with any datasource.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-where restricted_where
Attribute query (like SQL WHERE). Starting with GDAL 2.1, the \fB@filename\fP
syntax can be used to indicate that the content is in the pointed filename.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-skipfailures
Continue after a failure, skipping the failed feature.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-spat <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>
spatial query extents, in the SRS of the source layer(s) (or the one
specified with \fB\-spat_srs\fP). Only features whose geometry intersects the
extents will be selected. The geometries will not be clipped unless
\fB\-clipsrc\fP is specified.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-spat_srs <srs_def>
Override spatial filter SRS.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-geomfield <field>
Name of the geometry field on which the spatial filter operates on.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-dsco NAME=VALUE
Dataset creation option (format specific)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-lco NAME=VALUE
Layer creation option (format specific)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-nln <name>
Assign an alternate name to the new layer
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-nlt <type>
Define the geometry type for the created layer. One of \fBNONE\fP,
\fBGEOMETRY\fP, \fBPOINT\fP, \fBLINESTRING\fP, \fBPOLYGON\fP,
\fBGEOMETRYCOLLECTION\fP, \fBMULTIPOINT\fP, \fBMULTIPOLYGON\fP,
\fBMULTILINESTRING\fP, \fBCIRCULARSTRING\fP, \fBCOMPOUNDCURVE\fP,
\fBCURVEPOLYGON\fP, \fBMULTICURVE\fP, and \fBMULTISURFACE\fP non\-linear geometry
types. Add \fBZ\fP, \fBM\fP, or \fBZM\fP to the type name to specify coordinates
with elevation, measure, or elevation and measure. \fBPROMOTE_TO_MULTI\fP can
be used to automatically promote layers that mix polygon or multipolygons
to multipolygons, and layers that mix linestrings or multilinestrings to
multilinestrings. Can be useful when converting shapefiles to PostGIS and
other target drivers that implement strict checks for geometry types.
\fBCONVERT_TO_LINEAR\fP can be used to to convert non\-linear geometry types
into linear geometry types by approximating them, and \fBCONVERT_TO_CURVE\fP to
promote a non\-linear type to its generalized curve type (\fBPOLYGON\fP to
\fBCURVEPOLYGON\fP, \fBMULTIPOLYGON\fP to \fBMULTISURFACE\fP, \fBLINESTRING\fP to
\fBCOMPOUNDCURVE\fP, \fBMULTILINESTRING\fP to \fBMULTICURVE\fP). Starting with
version 2.1 the type can be defined as measured ("25D" remains as an alias for
single "Z"). Some forced geometry conversions may result in invalid
geometries, for example when forcing conversion of multi\-part multipolygons
with \fB\-nlt POLYGON\fP, the resulting polygon will break the Simple Features
rules.
.sp
Starting with GDAL 3.0.5, \fB\-nlt CONVERT_TO_LINEAR\fP and \fB\-nlt PROMOTE_TO_MULTI\fP
can be used simultaneously.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-dim <val>
Force the coordinate dimension to val (valid values are \fBXY\fP, \fBXYZ\fP,
\fBXYM\fP, and \fBXYZM\fP \- for backwards compatibility \fB2\fP is an alias for
\fBXY\fP and \fB3\fP is an alias for \fBXYZ\fP). This affects both the layer
geometry type, and feature geometries. The value can be set to \fBlayer_dim\fP
to instruct feature geometries to be promoted to the coordinate dimension
declared by the layer. Support for M was added in GDAL 2.1.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a_srs <srs_def>
Assign an output SRS, but without reprojecting (use \fI\%\-t_srs\fP
to reproject)
.sp
The coordinate reference systems that can be passed are anything supported by the
OGRSpatialReference.SetFromUserInput() call, which includes EPSG Projected,
Geographic or Compound CRS (i.e. EPSG:4296), a well known text (WKT) CRS definition,
PROJ.4 declarations, or the name of a .prj file containing a WKT CRS definition.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a_coord_epoch <epoch>
New in version 3.4.

.sp
Assign a coordinate epoch, linked with the output SRS. Useful when the
output SRS is a dynamic CRS. Only taken into account if \fI\%\-a_srs\fP
is used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t_srs <srs_def>
Reproject/transform to this SRS on output, and assign it as output SRS.
.sp
A source SRS must be available for reprojection to occur. The source SRS
will be by default the one found in the source layer when it is available,
or as overridden by the user with \fI\%\-s_srs\fP
.sp

PROJ.4 declarations, or the name of a .prj file containing a WKT CRS definition.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t_coord_epoch <epoch>
New in version 3.4.

.sp
Assign a coordinate epoch, linked with the output SRS. Useful when the
output SRS is a dynamic CRS. Only taken into account if \fI\%\-t_srs\fP
is used. It is also mutually exclusive with  \fI\%\-a_coord_epoch\fP\&.
.sp
Currently \fI\%\-s_coord_epoch\fP and \fI\%\-t_coord_epoch\fP are
mutually exclusive, due to lack of support for transformations between two dynamic CRS.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s_srs <srs_def>
Override source SRS. If not specified the SRS found in the input layer will
be used. This option has only an effect if used together with \fI\%\-t_srs\fP
to reproject.
.sp

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s_coord_epoch <epoch>
New in version 3.4.

.sp
Assign a coordinate epoch, linked with the source SRS. Useful when the
source SRS is a dynamic CRS. Only taken into account if \fI\%\-s_srs\fP
is used.
.sp
Currently \fI\%\-s_coord_epoch\fP and \fI\%\-t_coord_epoch\fP are
mutually exclusive, due to lack of support for transformations between two dynamic CRS.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-ct <string>
A PROJ string (single step operation or multiple step string starting with
+proj=pipeline), a WKT2 string describing a CoordinateOperation, or a
\fI\%urn:ogc:def:coordinateOperation:EPSG::XXXX\fP URN overriding the default
transformation from the source to the target CRS. It must take into account
the axis order of the source and target CRS.
.sp
New in version 3.0.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-preserve_fid
Use the FID of the source features instead of letting the output driver
automatically assign a new one (for formats that require a FID). If not
in append mode, this behavior is the default if the output driver has
a FID layer creation option, in which case the name of the source FID
column will be used and source feature IDs will be attempted to be
preserved. This behavior can be disabled by setting \fB\-unsetFid\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-fid fid
If provided, only the feature with the specified feature id will be
processed.  Operates exclusive of the spatial or attribute queries. Note: if
you want to select several features based on their feature id, you can also
use the fact the \(aqfid\(aq is a special field recognized by OGR SQL. So,
\fI\-where "fid in (1,3,5)"\fP would select features 1, 3 and 5.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-limit nb_features
Limit the number of features per layer.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-gt n
Group n features per transaction (default 100 000). Increase the value for
better performance when writing into DBMS drivers that have transaction
support. \fBn\fP can be set to unlimited to load the data into a single
transaction.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-ds_transaction
Force the use of a dataset level transaction (for drivers that support such
mechanism), especially for drivers such as FileGDB that only support
dataset level transaction in emulation mode.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-clipsrc [xmin ymin xmax ymax]|WKT|datasource|spat_extent
Clip geometries to the specified bounding box (expressed in source SRS),
WKT geometry (POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON), from a datasource or to the spatial
extent of the \-spat option if you use the spat_extent keyword. When
specifying a datasource, you will generally want to use it in combination
of the \-clipsrclayer, \-clipsrcwhere or \-clipsrcsql options
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-clipsrcsql <sql_statement>
Select desired geometries using an SQL query instead.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-clipdst <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>
Clip geometries after reprojection to the specified bounding box (expressed
in dest SRS), WKT geometry (POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON) or from a datasource.
When specifying a datasource, you will generally want to use it in
combination of the \-clipdstlayer, \-clipdstwhere or \-clipdstsql options
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-clipdstsql <sql_statement>
Select desired geometries using an SQL query instead.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.B \-clipdstlayer <layername>
Select the named layer from the destination clip datasource.
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-datelineoffset
Offset from dateline in degrees (default long. = +/\- 10deg, geometries
within 170deg to \-170deg will be split)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-simplify <tolerance>
Distance tolerance for simplification. Note: the algorithm used preserves
topology per feature, in particular for polygon geometries, but not for a
whole layer.

\fI\%OGRGeometryFactory::removeLowerDimensionSubGeoms()\fP, on geometries
to ensure they are valid regarding the rules of the Simple Features specification.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-fieldTypeToString type1,...
Converts any field of the specified type to a field of type string in the
destination layer. Valid types are : Integer, Integer64, Real, String,
Date, Time, DateTime, Binary, IntegerList, Integer64List, RealList,
StringList. Special value All can be used to convert all fields to strings.
This is an alternate way to using the CAST operator of OGR SQL, that may
avoid typing a long SQL query. Note that this does not influence the field
types used by the source driver, and is only an afterwards conversion.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-mapFieldType srctype|All=dsttype,...
Converts any field of the specified type to another type. Valid types are :
Integer, Integer64, Real, String, Date, Time, DateTime, Binary,
IntegerList, Integer64List, RealList, StringList. Types can also include
subtype between parenthesis, such as Integer(Boolean), Real(Float32), ...
Special value All can be used to convert all fields to another type. This
is an alternate way to using the CAST operator of OGR SQL, that may avoid
typing a long SQL query. This is a generalization of \-fieldTypeToString.
Note that this does not influence the field types used by the source
driver, and is only an afterwards conversion.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-gcp <ungeoref_x> <ungeoref_y> <georef_x> <georef_y> <elevation>
Add the indicated ground control point. This option may be provided
multiple times to provide a set of GCPs.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-order <n>
Order of polynomial used for warping (1 to 3). The default is to select a
polynomial order based on the number of GCPs.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-tps
Force use of thin plate spline transformer based on available GCPs.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-fieldmap
Specifies the list of field indexes to be copied from the source to the
destination. The (n)th value specified in the list is the index of the
field in the target layer definition in which the n(th) field of the source
layer must be copied. Index count starts at zero. To omit a field, specify
a value of \-1. There must be exactly as many values in the list as the
count of the fields in the source layer. We can use the \(aqidentity\(aq setting
to specify that the fields should be transferred by using the same order.
This setting should be used along with the \fB\-append\fP setting.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-addfields
This is a specialized version of \fB\-append\fP\&. Contrary to \fB\-append\fP,
\fB\-addfields\fP has the effect of adding, to existing target layers, the new
fields found in source layers. This option is useful when merging files
that have non\-strictly identical structures. This might not work for output
formats that don\(aqt support adding fields to existing non\-empty layers. Note
that if you plan to use \-addfields, you may need to combine it with
\-forceNullable, including for the initial import.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-relaxedFieldNameMatch
Do field name matching between source and existing target layer in a more
relaxed way if the target driver has an implementation for it.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-forceNullable
Do not propagate not\-nullable constraints to target layer if they exist in
source layer.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-unsetDefault
Do not propagate default field values to target layer if they exist in
source layer.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-unsetFid
Can be specified to prevent the name of the source FID column and source
feature IDs from being re\-used for the target layer. This option can for
example be useful if selecting source features with a ORDER BY clause.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-emptyStrAsNull
New in version 3.3.

.sp
Treat empty string values as null.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-resolveDomains
New in version 3.3.

.sp
When this is specified, any selected field that is linked to a coded field
domain will be accompanied by an additional field (\fB{dstfield}_resolved\fP),
that will contain the description of the coded value.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-nomd
To disable copying of metadata from source dataset and layers into target
dataset and layers, when supported by output driver.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-mo META\-TAG=VALUE
Passes a metadata key and value to set on the output dataset, when
supported by output driver.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-noNativeData
To disable copying of native data, i.e. details of source format not
captured by OGR abstraction, that are otherwise preserved by some drivers
(like GeoJSON) when converting to same format.
.sp
New in version 2.1.

.UNINDENT
.SH PERFORMANCE HINTS
.sp
When writing into transactional DBMS (SQLite/PostgreSQL,MySQL, etc...), it
might be beneficial to increase the number of INSERT statements executed
between BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT TRANSACTION statements. This number is
specified with the \-gt option. For example, for SQLite, explicitly defining \-gt
65536 ensures optimal performance while populating some table containing many
hundreds of thousands or millions of rows. However, note that \-skipfailures
overrides \-gt and sets the size of transactions to 1.
.sp
For PostgreSQL, the PG_USE_COPY config option can be set to YES for a
significant insertion performance boost. See the PG driver documentation page.
.sp
More generally, consult the documentation page of the input and output drivers
for performance hints.
