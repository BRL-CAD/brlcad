This directory contains source code defining a collection of
application independent classes supporting the editing of STEP
instance data.  This library includes functions for editing
individual instances and for manipulating groups of instances.
The editor library acts as an intermediary between the core library
and a graphical user interface library.

Directory Contents:

STEPfile.cc, STEPfile.h, STEPfile.inline.cc
Defines the class STEPfile, used to control the reading and writing of
data files and to interface with the file system for opening and
closing files.

cmdmgr.cc, cmdmgr.h
Defines CmdMgr, a class whose object contains lists of commands and
their statuses.  CmdMgr objects support a variety of operations such
as save, save incomplete, cancel, etc.  Also, the classes
ReplicateLinkNode and ReplicateList (specializations of the single
linked list data structure) are defined to support the implementation
of CmdMgr.

editordefines.h
Defines two enumeration types, displayStateEnum and stateEnum, and
defines a collection of constants used by STEPfile objects for reading
and writing files containing state information from the editing session.

s_HEADER_SCHEMA.cc, s_HEADER_SCHEMA.h, s_HEADER_SCHEMA.init.cc
These files are generated by exp2cxx using the header schema from
Part 21.  The header schema specifies the information in the header
section of an STEP exchange file.

schemaheader.cc, schemaheader.h
These files are generated by exp2cxx using the header schema from
Part 21.  The file names were manually changed from "schema.*" to
"schemaheader.*" in order to avoid naming conflicts when these classes
are linked with another exp2cxx-generated library.

seeinfodefault.h
Defines seeInfo, a class that inherits from DisplayNode and has the
same behavior.  seeInfo specifies the default visual representation
