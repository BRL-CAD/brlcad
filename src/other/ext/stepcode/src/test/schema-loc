# schema_loc   --  defines location of schema libraries & includes
# change these macros to reflect your environment

# ************  NOTE **********
# You need to change the values of the following macros to work with your
# environment.  See the README for details.  If you build your class
# libraries with 'mkProbe -i ...', you probably just need to change
# PDES_ROOT to reflect your structure.  Try to keep everything defined
# in terms of SCHEMA_NAME... that way you can build for different
# class libraries on the make command line witha minimum of fuss.

#
#  change PDES_ROOT to the location that SCL is installed
PDES_ROOT 	= /proj/pdevel/ds/scl3-1

#  change ARCH_ROOT to keep different compilers separate
#ARCH_ROOT	= $(PDES_ROOT)/arch$(TARGET_ARCH)
ARCH_ROOT	= $(PDES_ROOT)/arch-gnu-sunos-40

#  change MAKE_RULES to use different compilers
MAKE_RULES 	= $(ARCH_ROOT)/make_rules
include $(MAKE_RULES)

#	Locations for the schema class library and header files.  You
#	need to generate and make the schema supplied with the release
#	from $(PDES_ROOT)/data/example/example.exp
#

SCHEMA_NAME 	= example
SCHEMA_DIR 	= $(PDES_ROOT)/src/clSchemas/$(SCHEMA_NAME)
SCHEMA_LIB_DIR 	= $(ARCH_ROOT)/Probes/$(SCHEMA_NAME)
LIBSCHEMA 	= -L$(SCHEMA_LIB_DIR) -lC$(SCHEMA_NAME)
