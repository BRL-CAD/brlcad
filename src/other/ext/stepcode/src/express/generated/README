This directory contains pre-generated outputs from the Perplex/RE2C/Lemon
toolchain.  Their purpose is to allow SC to build on platforms that do
not have those tools installed, when users/developers do not need to alter the
lexing and parsing logic.

DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES.  They are machine generated and should not be modified
directly - bugs in these files need to be fixed in either the
Perplex/RE2C/Lemon input files or the tools themselves.  Directly changing
these files will result in a build failure.

If changes need to be made, the correct approach is:

1.  install Perplex, RE2C, and Lemon
2.  make any necessary fixes to the input files and/or the generator tools.
3.  run the build, and copy the new generated expscan and expparse c and h
    files to this directory.
4.  run the build target "express_md5gen" to generate a new verification_info.cmake
    file, and copy that file into this directory as well.

The verification_info.cmake file in this directory is used by CMake to protect
the integrity of the generated files.

If iterative debugging is necessary, set the cmake configure variable
DEBUGGING_GENERATED_SOURCES to avoid having to update generated sources and md5
sums each time an input file is changed.
