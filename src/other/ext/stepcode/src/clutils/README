This directory contains source code defining a set of generic classes,
data structures, and functions that are used in the STEP Class
Library.  These items are generic in that they are in no way specific
to STEP.  In fact, some of the source code in this directory was taken
from various public domain libraries.

Defines GenNodeArray, an abstract base class for building arrays of
objects derived from GenericNode.

gennodelist.cc, gennodelist.h
Defines GenNodeList, an abstract base class for building doubly linked
lists of objects derived from GenericNode.

scl_hash.cc, scl_hash.h
