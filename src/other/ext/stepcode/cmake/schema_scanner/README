README for STEPcode schema scanner
--------------

The files in this directory are for a schema scanner executable, built by CMake
during the configuration stage.

This scanner is used to determine the file names that exp2cxx will use. In
CMake, all file names must be known before configuration finishes - so it is
necessary to parse the schemas early.

This appears to be a standalone project to CMake, but it is intended to be
built only as part of STEPcode. It is configured, built, and executed during
the configuration stage of STEPcode.
