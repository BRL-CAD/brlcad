# The final output is sorted by risk level, most risky first.

# The following code accepts unified diff format from both subversion (svn)
# and GNU diff, which aren't well-documented.  It gets filenames from
# "Index:" if exists, else from the "+++ FILENAME ..." entry.
# Note that this is different than some tools (which will use "+++" in
# preference to "Index:"), but subversion's nonstandard format is easier
# to handle this way.
# Since they aren't well-documented, here's some info on the diff formats:
# GNU diff format:
#    --- OLDFILENAME OLDTIMESTAMP
#    +++ NEWFILENAME NEWTIMESTAMP
#    @@ -OLDSTART,OLDLENGTH +NEWSTART,NEWLENGTH @@
#    ... Changes where preceding "+" is add, "-" is remove, " " is unchanged.
#
#    ",OLDLENGTH" and ",NEWLENGTH" are optional  (they default to 1).
#    GNU unified diff format doesn't normally output "Index:"; you use
#    the "+++/---" to find them (presuming the diff user hasn't used --label
#    to mess it up).
#
# Subversion format:
#    Index: FILENAME
#    --- OLDFILENAME (comment)
#    +++ NEWFILENAME (comment)
#    @@ -OLDSTART,OLDLENGTH +NEWSTART,NEWLENGTH @@
#
#    In subversion, the "Index:" always occurs, and note that paren'ed
#    comments are in the oldfilename/newfilename, NOT timestamps like
#    everyone else.
#
# Single Unix Spec version 3 (http://www.unix.org/single_unix_specification/)
# does not specify unified format at all; it only defines the older
# (obsolete) context diff format.  That format DOES use "Index:", but
# only when the filename isn't specified otherwise.
# We're only supporting unified format directly; if you have an older diff
# format, use "patch" to apply it, and then use "diff -u" to create a
# unified format.

  Hit is initialized with a tuple containing the following:

    level: (default) warning level, 0-5. 0=no problem, 5=very risky.
    warning: warning (text saying what's the problem)

              "tmpfile" (temporary file creation), "format" (format string).
              Use "" if you don't have a better category.

    other:  A dictionary with other settings.

  Other settings usually set:

  --help      Show this usage help

  --allowlink
              Allow symbolic links.
  --followdotdir
              Follow directories whose names begin with ".".

  --context
  -c          Show context (the line having the "hit"/potential flaw)

  --columns   Show  the  column  number  (as well as the file name and
              line number) of each hit; this is shown after the line number
              by adding a colon and the column number in the line (the first
              character in a line is column number 1).
  
  --html      Display as HTML output.

  -m X
  --minlevel=X
              Set minimum risk level to X for inclusion in hitlist.  This
              can be from 0 (``no risk'')  to  5  (``maximum  risk'');  the
              default is 1.

  -S
  --singleline Single-line output.

  --neverignore
  -n          Never ignore security issues, even if they have an ``ignore''
              directive in a comment.

  --immediate
  -i          Immediately display hits (don't just wait until the end).

  --inputs    Show only functions that obtain data from outside the program;
  -I          this also sets minlevel to 0.

  --nolink    Skip symbolic links (ignored).

  --omittime  Omit time to run.

  --patch=F   display information related to the patch F. (patch must be already applied)

  --Q
  --quiet     Don't display status information (i.e., which files are being
              examined) while the analysis is going on.

  --D
  --dataonly  Don't display the headers and footers of the analysis;
              use this along with --quiet to get just the results.
  
  --listrules List the rules in the ruleset (rule database).

  --loadhitlist=F
              Load hits from F instead of analyzing source programs.

  --savehitlist=F
              Save all hits (the "hitlist") to F.

  --diffhitlist=F
              Show only hits (loaded or analyzed) not in F.

  documentation.
