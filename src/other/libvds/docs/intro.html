<a name="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2>
VDSlib is a software package that implements <i>view-dependent 
simplification</i>, a geometric level-of-detail algorithm for
managing the complexity of polygonal scenes for interactive 3-D
graphics.  Unlike traditional approaches, which compute discreet
levels of detail for each object in a preprocess, VDSlib computes
a data structure from which the desired level of detail can be
dynamically extracted at run-time.  The advantages of this approach
include:
<ul>
<li><b>Better fidelity:</b> Because different parts of an object can
span multiple levels of detail (for example, distant regions of
a large object can be rendered with less fidelity than nearby
regions), polygons are used only where they are needed.  The result
is better overall fidelity across the entire scene for a given polygon 
count.
</li><li><b>Smoother transitions:</b> Level of detail is adjusted each
frame, usually by a few polygons at a time.  These gradual and
fine-grained changes tend to be less noticible than the sudden
"pops", common in traditional static LOD systems, between 
discreet object resolutions.
</li><li><b>Simplification of large objects:</b> Large complex objects, such
as the terrain in a flight simulator or the hull of a ship in a
maritime CAD application, present a problem for traditional
approaches.  Since part of the object may be near the viewer while
other parts are quite distant, neither a high-resolution or a
low-resolution version of the object is satisfactory: rendering the
first will result in unacceptable frame rates, while rendering the
second will produce unacceptably poor fidelity.  By adjusting the
level of detail dynamically at run time, the object can be
represented with high fidelity near the viewer and low fidelity far
from the viewer, with a smooth degradation of detail in between.
</li></ul>

<a name="vertextree"></a></p><h2><a name="vertextree">The Vertex Tree</a></h2><a name="vertextree">

The fundamental data structure used by VDSlib is the <i>vertex
tree</i>, a hierarchical clustering of vertices.  Vertices from the
original model are grouped with nearby vertices into clusters, then the
clusters are clustered together, and so on.  Leaf nodes of the tree
represent a single vertex from the original model; interior nodes
represent multiple vertices clustered together, and the root node
represents all vertices from the entire model, merged into a single
cluster.  Each node stores a <i>representative vertex</i> or 
<i>proxy</i>, which may be one of the original vertices that node
represents or some average of those vertices.  </a><p><a name="vertextree">

<i>Folding</i> a node merges all of the vertices represented by that
node into the node's single proxy vertex.  In the process, triangles
whose vertices have been merged together are removed from the scene,
decreasing the overall polygon count.  <i>Unfolding</i> the node
reverses the process one level of the vertex tree, splitting the node's
proxy vertex into the proxies of the node's children:<br> <img src="fold.png"><br>

The triangles which will be affected by folding and unfolding a node
can be precomputed and stored with the node, enabling very fast
fold/unfold operations.  This is what VDSlib does; given an input mesh
and a clustering of the vertices of that mesh, VDSlib will perform all
the computation necessary to simplify and render mesh represented by
the tree in a view-dependent fashion.

This section gives a brief overview of using VDSlib; see the 
VDSlib Reference Manual for more details.</a><p><a name="using">

The first task is <!--1--></a><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/Buildingthevertextree.html">Building the vertex tree</a>.  This is done as a
preprocess, initiated by calling <!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/vdsBeginVertexTree.html">vdsBeginVertexTree</a>().  The user
begins by specifying the geometry of the original full-resolution model
as a sequence of vertices and triangles.  The vertices, which will form
the leaf nodes of the final vertex tree, are added via
<!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/vdsAddNode.html">vdsAddNode</a>().  Triangles are added with <!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/vdsAddTri.html">vdsAddTri</a>().
Triangles may be intermixed with the vertices that form their corners,
but all geometry must be added between calls to <!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/vdsBeginGeometry.html">vdsBeginGeometry</a>() 
and <!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/vdsEndGeometry.html">vdsEndGeometry</a>().  Once <!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/vdsEndGeometry.html">vdsEndGeometry</a>() is called, the
user may start the clustering process.</p><p>

<!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/vdsClusterNodes.html">vdsClusterNodes</a>() takes multiple nodes (up to
<!--2--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/VDSlibmacros.html#DOC.12.1">VDS_MAXDEGREE</a>, a user-defined macro) and clusters them as
siblings under a new parent node.  Using this function the user should
cluster all vertices of the original model, cluster all the resulting
nodes, and so on, until all nodes have been clustered into a tree with
a single root node.  Since the final data structure must form a tree, a
node other than the root must have exactly one parent node.  In other
words, each node may only be clustered once.</p><p>

Once all nodes have been clustered to form a single rooted tree, a call 
to <!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/vdsEndVertexTree.html">vdsEndVertexTree</a>() concludes the preprocess.  This function
checks the validity of the vertex tree, assigns bounding volumes to nodes, 
computes which triangles will be affected by fold/unfold operations and 
assigns those triangles to the apprpropriate node.  Since this increases
the storage required by each node, the node structures allocated by 
<!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/vdsClusterNodes.html">vdsClusterNodes</a>() are reallocated here.  <!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/vdsEndVertexTree.html">vdsEndVertexTree</a>()
returns a pointer to the root of the newly-allocated vertex tree.  This 
tree is now ready for view-dependent simplification and rendering.</p><p>

<!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/Dynamicvertextreemaintenance.html">Dynamic vertex tree maintenance</a> routines enable view-dependent
simplification.  Nodes in the vertex tree may be folded or unfolded.
The rules that govern folding nodes ensure, first, that all ancestors
of an unfolded node will themselves be unfolded, and second, that all
folded nodes will have one or more unfolded ancestors (unless the root
itself is folded).  Nodes on the boundary between folded and unfolded
are labeled <i>Boundary nodes</i>; the path of Boundary nodes across
the vertex tree forms the <i>active boundary</i>.  By definition, only
Boundary nodes may be unfolded and only parents of boundary nodes
(i.e., nodes with only Boundary nodes as children) may be folded.  The
function <!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/vdsAdjustTreeBoundary.html">vdsAdjustTreeBoundary</a> walks the active boundary of a
vertex tree, applying a user-specifed callback to decide whether to
fold or unfold each node on the boundary.  By using view-dependent
information, such as the distance and angle to the viewpoint, this
callback can control the simplification in a view-dependent fashion.
Calling <!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/vdsAdjustTreeBoundary.html">vdsAdjustTreeBoundary</a>() continuously thus performs
dynamic view-dependent simplification on the object or scene
represented by the given vertex tree.</p><p>

<!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/Renderingthecurrentsimplification.html">Rendering the current simplification</a> is the final step.  This 
simplification is represented by the current boundary through
a vertex tree: in VDS parlance, the current simplification consists 
of all the <i>subtris</i> of the nodes above the active boundary.
For efficiency, these triangles are cached into an <i>active triangle
list</i> for rapid rendering; for further efficiency, VDSlib actually
used multiple active triangle lists, each associated with a high-level
node in the vertex tree.  This enables view-frustum culling of the 
active simplification: if a node is determined to be invisible, its
active triangle list need not be rendered.  The function 
<!--1--><a href="http://vdslib.virginia.edu/vdsdoc/vdsRenderTree.html">vdsRenderTree</a>() traverses the vertex tree, culling and rendering
these active triangle lists with user-specified callbacks. 

<a name="standard"></a></p><h2><a name="standard">Standard Callbacks</a></h2><a name="standard">

VDSlib uses a number of user-specified callbacks to give the
programmer a great deal of freedom.  With these callbacks, the 
developer can control how VDS clusters, culls, simplifies, and renders
the model.  However, the typical VDS user will not want to write
callbacks specifying all of these behaviors before using the library.
For this reason VDSlib comes packaged with an optional library of
standard callbacks.  These callbacks provide simple criteria for
folding and unfolding nodes, testing node visibility, and rendering the
active triangle list associated with a node.  These standard callbacks
also serve as examples for developers who wish to write their own
callbacks.  At this writing, the standard library represents only a few
simple algorithms for size-based simplification and view-frustum
culling, but over time additional callbacks will be collected into the
library for more sophisticated techniques such as silhouette
preservation and cell-portal occlusion culling.  <p>
