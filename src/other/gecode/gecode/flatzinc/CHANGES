Version 1.7 (?)
 * Fixed bug in grammar for annotation expressions
 * Added cumulative-constraint
 * Added MiniZinc Challenge-style options
 * More detailed statistics
 * Exit with error code when interpretation of FlatZinc fails
 * Fixed handling of arrays of par sets
 * Fixed array_set_element constraint
 * Added specializations for sum_pred and nvalue and fixed exactly_int
 * Fixed output for problems that have no solution
Version 1.6 (2009-05-21)
 * Adapted to changes in FlatZinc:
   - removed output items
   - added handling of output annotations
   - output in alphabetical order, and separate output for different solutions
   - support nested annotations, in particular the new search annotations
   - parse (and ignore) predicate declarations
   - split globals definitions into individual files
 * Replaced pkg-config based configuration with configure options
   for finding the Gecode installation
 * Do not require Gist (and detect it automatically)
 * Support for parallel (multi-threaded) search

Version 1.5 (released 2009-03-24)
 * The command line option -mode gist now behaves as advertised

Version 1.4 (released 2009-03-13)
 * Updated to compile with Gecode 3.0.0
 * Fixed conditional output items
 * Print variables as required by the upcoming FlatZinc specification

Version 1.3 (released 2008-08-26)
 * Can be compiled without support for set variables (if not present in 
   Gecode)
 * Updated to new FlatZinc specification:
   - arrays start at index 1 now
   - var declarations can have initializers
   - conditional output using show_cond
 * Added array_bool_clause, regular, sort, inverse constraints
 * Fixed constraints introduced by sharing, e.g.
   var 0..3: x = 3; var 0..2: y = x;
   will result in failure
 * Fixed bug that caused initializers for array of var set to fail
 * Fixed int_div and int_mod
 * Use mmap where available to map input files directly to memory
 * Use specialized Boolean linear propagators in globals library

Version 1.2.1 (released 2008-03-06)
 * Small fixes in the build system (support for static libraries,
   better support for Mac OS X universal binaries)

Version 1.2 (released 2008-02-29)
 * Updated to compile with Gecode 2.1.0

Version 1.1 (released 2008-02-13)
 * Added support for constant declarations (like int: a=3;)
 * New constraints required by FlatZinc specification (mostly int_lin_*)
 * More verbose error reports
 * Accept carriage return (Windows end-of-line)
 * Fixed bug in output of Boolean variables

Version 1.0 (released 2007-11-15)
 * initial release
