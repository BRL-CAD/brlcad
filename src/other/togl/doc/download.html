    <h2><a name="prereq">Prerequisites</a></h2>

    <p>
    You should have
    <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl and Tk</a>
    installed on your computer.
    Togl works with Tcl/Tk version 8.1 and up
    (all recent testing has been with version 8.4).
    The Mac OS X version requires version 8.4
    (note: versions 8.4.12 and 8.4.13 have a bug when unmapping Togl widgets).

    <p>
    You must also have
    <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> or
    <a href="http://www.mesa3d.org">Mesa</a>
    (a free alternative to OpenGL with the same API)
    installed on your computer.

    <p>
    And one should be familiar with Tcl, Tk, OpenGL,
    and C programming to use Togl effectively.

    <br>
    <h2><a name="getting">Downloading Togl</a></h2>

    <p>
    Togl can be downloaded from the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=519">
      SourceForge</a> Files page.

    <p>
    Several prebuilt binary distributions are available
    as well as a source distribution.

    <h2><a name="building">Installing Togl</a></h2>

    <h3>Installing prebuild binaries</h3>

    <p>
    Prebuilt binaries provide a Togl2.1 directory,
    the togl.h, togl_ws.h and toglDecls.h include files,
    and the togl stub library
    (libToglstub2.1.a or Toglstub20.lib, <i>etc</i>).
    The Togl2.1 directory needs to copied
    into one of the directories on Tcl's package path
    (type <code>puts $auto_path</code> in the Tcl interpreter to see
    the list of directories).
    If you have C code that needs to access Togl's subroutines directly,
    place the include file in the same place as Tcl's include file and
    the stub library in the same place as Tcl's stub library.

    <h3>Installing from source</h3>

    <p>
    Togl uses the Tcl Extension Architecture to be able to build on the
    same platforms Tcl can be built on.
    In addition to the Togl source,
    you will need to have the Tcl and Tk source distributions
    because not all installations have the needed Tcl and Tk internal header files.

    <p>
    How you link with Togl depends on how you're planning to use it.
    There are basically three ways of using Togl with your application:
    <ul>
      <li>
      Install the Togl shared library and pkgIndex.tcl file
      (using <code>make install</code>)
      and link to the Togl stubs library with your executable or shared library.
      In this case you must call Togl_InitStubs() (and probably Tcl_InitStubs()
      &mdash; Tk_InitStubs is only needed if you call Tk functions).
      This is the way the included Togl examples are built.

      <li>
      Link to the Togl shared library
      or &quot;compile in&quot; the Togl object files
      with your executable or shared library.
      In this case you must call Togl_Init() from your C code
      to initialize Togl.

      <li>
      Install the Togl shared library and pkgIndex.tcl file
      (using <code>make install</code>)
      and then load it using Tcl commands or Tcl_PkgRequire().
      Then use Tcl commands to create and manipulate the Togl widget.
    </ul>

    Since Togl is compiled into a shared library using the Tcl/Tk stubs-interface,
    the same binary can be used with any version of Tck/Tk from 8.1 and up.
    See <code>README.stubs</code> for more info.

    <p>
    Specific platform notes follow:

    <h4><a name="x11">Unix/X11 usage</a></h4>

    <p>
    Unix/X systems only need the public Tcl/Tk include files.
    Just <code>configure</code>, <code>make</code>,
    and optionally <code>make install</code>.

    <h4><a name="windows">Microsoft Windows usage</a></h4>

    <p>
    Microsoft Windows platforms need <code>tkWinInt.h</code>
    and other internal Tk header files.  So you need a Tcl/Tk
    source distribution in addition to the Togl distribution
    (or copy over the various include files).
    <p>
    Here's the minimal way to build Togl with Tcl/Tk
    using the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">gcc</a> that is distributed
    as part of the <a href="http://cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> tools
    (<a href="www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>'s compilers work too):
    <blockquote><pre><code>
VER=8.4.12
SRCDIR=`pwd`

cd $SRCDIR/tcl$VER/win
env 'CC=gcc -mno-cygwin' ./configure --enable-threads
make libtclstub84.a

cd $SRCDIR/tk$VER/win
env 'CC=gcc -mno-cygwin' ./configure --enable-threads
make libtkstub84.a

cd $SRCDIR/Togl2.1
env 'CC=gcc -mno-cygwin' ./configure --with-tcl=../tcl$VER/win --with-tk=../tk$VER/win

make
</code></pre></blockquote>
    The resulting <code>Togl21.dll</code> and <code>pkgIndex.tcl</code>
    should be installed into your Tcl installation just like any other package.

    <p>
    If you change all of the above <code>make</code>'s
    to <code>make install</code> instead,
    then the Togl package is installed correctly.

    <h4><a name="macosx">Mac OS X usage</a></h4>

    <p>
    These special instructions are for building the Aqua version of Togl.
    Mac OS X needs <code>tkMacOSXInt.h</code>
    and other internal Tk header files.
    Unfortunately, the Tcl and Tk frameworks that Apple distributes
    are missing the internal headers.
    So you need a Tcl/Tk source distribution in addition to the Togl
    distribution (or copy over the various include files).
    You would probably want a newer version of Tcl and Tk anyway
    because each minor revision of 8.4 has many Aqua bug fixes.
    <p>
    Here's one way to build Tcl, Tk, and Togl on Mac OS X
    (assuming they are all in the same directory)
    to install in your home directory:
    <blockquote><pre><code>
VER=8.4.12

mkdir -p ~/bin
make -C tcl$VER/macosx install PREFIX="${HOME}" INSTALL_PATH="${HOME}/Library/Frameworks"
make -C tk$VER/macosx install PREFIX="${HOME}" INSTALL_PATH="${HOME}/Library/Frameworks" APPLICATION_INSTALL_PATH="${HOME}/Applications"

cd Togl2.1
./configure --prefix="${HOME}"
make install
</code></pre></blockquote>
