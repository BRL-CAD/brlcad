.SH NAME
tabinterp \- combine and interpolate multiple data files to create an animation script
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tabinterp
.B >table.final
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I tabinterp
reads a series of commands from standard input which
designate what parts of various data files should be used
as input tables for various
.I channels
of animation parameters.
Commands may extend across multiple lines,
and are semi-colon (';') terminated.
Each channel is then interpolated using one of a variety of
interpolation techniques to provide an output table
which has one line for each time step.
.PP
The overall notion is based on parameter
.I tables.
Each table is arranged so that every row (line) represents the
state of some set of parameters at a given
.I time.
Each column of the table represents a single parameter, or data
.I channel,
with the left-most column always representing
.I time.
.PP
The first task in preparing to use
.IR tabinterp (1)
is to assign specific purposes to each channel in the output table.
For example, channels 0, 1, and 2 might be used to represent the
X, Y, and Z positions of an object, respectively, while channels 3, 4, and 5
might be used to represent the "aim point" of the virtual camera, while
channel 6 might be used to represent the brightness of one of the
objects or light sources, and channel 7 might be used to represent the
zoom factor (viewsize) of the virtual camera.
Once the channel assignment has been decided upon, the source file
containing the table of raw values for each channel must be identified.
Several output channels may get their raw values from different columns
of a single input table (file).
Up to 64 columns of input may appear
in an input table.
.PP
For each file which contains an input table, the
.B file
command is given to load the necessary columns of raw values into
the output channels.
If a channel number in the list is given as a minus ('-'),
that input column is skipped.
.sp .5
   file filename chan_num(s);
.sp .5
Using the output channel assignments given above
as an example, if an input table existed in a file named "table1"
which consisted of
five columns of values representing (time, brightness, objX, objY, objZ),
then these values would be loaded with this command:
.sp .5
   file table1 6 0 1 2;
.sp .5
This command indicates that from the file "table1", the current time and
four columns of parameters should be read into the raw output table,
with the first input column representing the time, the second input
column representing the value for output channel 6 (brightness),
the third input column representing the value for output channel 0 (objX),
etc.
Each row of the input file must fit on a single (newline terminated) line
of text, with columns separated by one or more spaces and tabs.
.PP
After all the
.B file
commands have been given, it is necessary to define over what range of
time all the values just read into the
the raw output table will be sent on to the interpolators, and
how many rows of interpolated output should be produced for each second
(time unit) in the input file.
.sp .5
   times start stop fps;
.sp .5
The
.I fps
parameter can be thought of as the
``frames per second'' rate of the interpolation, and is usually set
to 24 for film (cine) work, 30 for NTSC video, and 60 for field-at-a-time
NTSC video.  Any positive integer value is acceptable.
(In fact, any time unit can be used, as the time channel is dimensionless.
Nothing depends on the units being seconds.)
For example, the command:
.sp .5
   times 1 7.3 24;
.sp .5
would cause
.I tabinterp
to process data values from time 1 second to 7.3 seconds, producing
24 output rows uniformly separated in time for the passage of each second.
.PP
After the
.B times
command has been given, it is necessary to associate an interpolator
procedure or a ``value generator'' command with each output channel.
The available interpolator procedures are:
\fBstep, linear, spline, cspline,\fR and \fBquat\fR.
The available value generator commands are:
\fBrate, accel,\fR and \fBnext\fR.
The interpolator procedures are selected by giving commands of this form:
.sp .5
   interp type chan_num(s);
.sp .5
For example, the command:
.sp .5
   interp linear 3 4 5;
.sp .5
would indicate that output channels 3, 4, and 5 (representing the camera
aim point) would be processed using linear interpolation.
If only a starting and ending values
are given in the input (\fIi.e.\fR the input file had only two rows),
then this is an easy way of moving something from one place to another.
In this case, if more than two input rows had been provided, there
would be a noticeable "jerk" as the camera passed through each
of the input parameter values, an effect which is rarely desired.
To avoid this, the
.B spline
interpolator can be used, which fits an interpolating spline (with open
end conditions) through the given data values, resulting in smooth motion.
If the starting and ending values are the same, a continuous spline
(with closed end conditions) can be used instead by specifying
.B cspline.
Both of the spline interpolators require at least
three rows to have been provided in the input file.
.PP
If the output values are to "jump" from one input value to the next,
(\fIi.e.\fR no interpolation at all is desired), then specify
.B step.
This can be useful for having lights switch between several intensities
(for example, a 3-way bulb with 30, 70, and 100 watt settings),
or for having objects "teleport" into position at just the right moment.
.PP
The interpolation method indicated on the
.B interp
command is assigned to all the output channels listed.
One exception to this rule is the
.B quat
(Quaternion) interpolator.
Quaternions are used to describe an orientation in space, and can be
most easily thought of as containing a vector in space, from which they
obtain a pointing direction, and a "twist" angle around that vector.
To do this, quaternions are processed in blocks of four channels, which
must be numbered sequentially (\fIe.g.\fR channels 7, 8, 9, 10).
Giving the command
.sp .5
   interp quat 7 15;
.sp .5
assigns the quaternion interpolator to two blocks of four channels,
the block starting with channel 7 (\fIe.g.\fR channels 7, 8, 9, 10),
and the block starting with channel 15.
.PP
.I tabinterp
is strictly an interpolator.  It will not extrapolate values
before the first input value, nor after the last output value.
The first or last value is simple repeated.
.PP
In addition to interpolation, it is possible to specify rate
and acceleration based output channels.
In cases where the exact running time of a scene is not known,
the
.B rate
and
.B accel
commands can be quite useful.
One command is given
for each output channel.
The
.B rate
command takes these arguments:
.sp .5
   rate chan_num init_value incr_per_sec;
.sp .5
For example,
.sp .5
   rate 6 1.5 0.5;
.sp .5
says to make channel 6 a rate based channel, with the initial value
(at time=0) of 1.5, linearly increasing with an increment of 0.5 for
the passing of every additional second (time unit).
In this case, the value would be 2.0 at time=1, 2.5 at time=2, and so on.
This can be used to establish linear changes where it is the increment
and not the final value that is important.
For example, the rotation angle of a helicopter rotor could be specified
in this way.
.PP
The
.B accel
command takes these arguments:
.sp .5
   accel chan_num init_value mult_per_sec;
.sp .5
For example,
.sp .5
   accel 5 10 2;
.sp .5
says to make channel 5 an acceleration based channel,
with the initial value at time=0 of 10.0, which is multipled by
2 for every additional second (time unit).
In this case, the value would be 20.0 at time=1, and 40.0 at time=2.
This can be useful to create constant acceleration, such as
a car accelerating smoothly away from it's position at rest
in front of a stop sign.
If the initial value is zero, all subsequent values will also be zero.
.PP
Sometimes it is desirable to create an output channel which looks
ahead (or behind) in time.
For example, a good way to animate a rocket flying on a complex course
would be to simply animate the position of the base of the rocket,
and then look ahead in time to see where the rocket is going to go next
in order to determine where to aim the nose of the rocket (by rotating it).
This kind of lookahead is easily implemented using the
.B next
command.
.sp .5
   next dest_chan src_chan nsamp;
.sp .5
(See also the
.B fromto
directive in
.IR tabsub (1)
which is used in conjunction with this).
The command
.sp .5
   next 4 5 +3;
.sp .5
says to fill channel 4 with the values that will be present in channel 5
at 3 output rows later on.
Negative values are also permitted.
Since the lookahead is defined in terms of output rows rather than
time units, this means that the values generated for this column will
change as the frames per second (fps) value on the
.B times
command is changed.
This is almost always the effect which is desired, since as the
temporal resolution of the interpolation is increased,
the accuracy of the look-ahead will increase as well.
However, if the effect desired is one of "have the camera track where
the main actor was three seconds ago", then the number of steps given
here will have to be changed when the fps value is changed.
Be careful of the values generated for the last (or first)
.I nsamp
output rows.
Looking forward or backward in time beyond the bounds of the interpolation
will retrieve the last (or first) output values.
So it takes
.I nsamp
output rows to ``prime the pumps''.
.PP
Whenever a pound sign ('#') is encountered in the command input,
all characters from there to the end of the input line are discarded.
This is the same commenting convention used in the Bourne shell,
.IR sh (1).
.PP
When
.I tabinterp
encounters an end-of-file on it's standard input, it computes the
requested interpolations, and writes the output table on standard output.
If no values have been assigned to an output channel, then
the value given is a single dot ('.').  This preserves the
positional white-space-separated columns nature of the output table.
If this column is read as a numeric value by a downstream program,
it will be accepted as a valid floating-point zero.
.PP
As an aid to debugging, it is possible to dump the raw values of
columns of the output table before the interpolation is run:
.sp .5
   idump;
.br
   idump chan_num(s);
.sp .5
If no output channel numbers are given, all channels are dumped,
otherwise only the indicated channels are dumped.
.PP
The
.B help
command can be given to get a list of all available commands.
(Don't forget the semi-colon).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-q
enables quiet mode. This option suppresses the status messages
that are normally printed on standard error.
.SH EXAMPLE
What follows here is a Bourne shell script which will generate
two input tables using ``here documents'', and will then
produce an interpolated output table of 8 channels.

Try clipping this example out of the manual page
(usually found in /usr/brlcad/man/man1/tabinterp.1)
and running it.
This example will be continued in the manual page for
.IR tabsub (1).
.SH "POST PROCESSING"
.PP
Because both the input and output tables consist of
a single line of text for each time step,
many of the standard UNIX tools can be brought to bear to assist
in creating an animation.
To visualize the exact position taken by the aim point
in the example (output channels 3, 4, 5), a UNIX-plot file
of that trajectory can be created with:
.sp .5
   cut -f5,6,7 table.final | xyz-pl > aim.pl
.br
   cut -f1,5,6,7 table.final | txyz-pl > aim.pl
.sp .5
Similarly, the position of the main object can be viewed with
.sp .5
   cut -f2,3,4 table.final | xyz-pl > obj.pl
.sp .5
.I tabinterp
uses 0-based column numbering, while
.I cut
uses 1-based column numbering.
Also, the first output column from
.I tabinterp
is always the time.  The 0-th data column comes second.
.PP
The plot file just created can be viewed using
.IR pl-fb (1)
or
.IR pl-sgi (1),
or it can be viewed in
.IR mged (1)
by giving the command
.sp .5
   overlay aim.pl
.sp .5
to
.I mged.
If the model geometry is brought into view using the
.I mged
.B e
command, then the camera aim track (or any other spatial parameter)
can be viewed in direct relationship to the three dimensional geometry
which is going to be animated.
.SH "PREPARING INPUT TABLES"
.PP
The
.IR mged (1)
.B savekey
and
.B saveview
commands can be very useful for creating the input tables necessary
for driving
.IR tabinterp .
The details of doing this are beyond the scope of this manual page.
.PP
The
.IR awk (1)
command can also be useful for routing through the output files
of existing scientific analysis programs, and extracting the
few gems of data burried in the heaps of ``printout''.
