Archer was developed under the Phase II Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant AF03-141 (reference contract FA8651-04-C-0137) under the supervision of Lt. Edwin Rodriquez (AFRL/MNAL).Archer is built upon BRL-CAD.  SURVICE would like to acknowledge the contribution and support from the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) BRL-CAD Development Team, without which Archer would not be possible.The following is the Archer Development Team:- Bob Parker: Principal programmer- Doug Howard: Original coding and plug-in interface design- Keith Bowman: Architecture - Steve Phillips: Website and Software Change Request (SCR) tracking system- Mark Butkiewicz: Project Management
