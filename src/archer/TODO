TODO List for integrating MGED features into Archer

Intended as a "list of work to be done" for porting MGED features to Archer.  The absence of a feature
does not necessarily mean it is intended that this feature be added, particularly for "minor" features
or features that are currently not working well in MGED to start with - these are primarly discussion
points.

Starting with a "walkthrough" of the MGED menu:

     MGED Feature                   |         Archer Status of Feature or Alternative to Feature
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create New Database                 |                             DONE
Open Existing Database              |                             DONE
Import Database	                    |    dbconcat available on command line, no menu options as in MGED
Export Database                     |    keep available on command line, no GUI menu options
Load Script                         |    no GUI dialog available, presumably command line works?
Raytrace Control Panel              |    older version in Archer, needs updating to current MGED
Render View options                 |                            UNKNOWN
Preferences->Units                  |    No GUI options for setting, units works on command line
Preferences->Command Line Edit      |                            UNKNOWN
Preferences->Special Characters     |                            UNKNOWN
Preferences->Colors                 |    Subset of MGED panel available in Archer preferences tabs, are
                                    |    more needed?  Not clear.
Preferences->Fonts                  |                            UNKNOWN
Create/Update .mgedrc               |    Would be .archerrc?     UNKNOWN
Clear Command Window                |    clear command works on command line, Menu item needed?
Exit                                |                             DONE
Primitive Selection                 |    Not as such - tree view sufficient?
Matrix Selection                    |                            UNKNOWN
Primitive Editor                    |    Not as such - needed or right panel editing options sufficient?
Combination Editor                  |    Not clear if Archer functionality is as flexible, but most
				    |    functionality is present in editing tabs to right of view
Attribute Editor                    |    Not present in general form
Geometry Browser                    |    Make sure tree widget duplicates all functionality, maybe done
Create Primitives                   |                           INCOMPLETE
View                                |                             DONE  (duplicated elsewhere)
ViewRing			    |                            UNKNOWN
 


Other Issues
------------

* archer html documentation refers to an 'ae' command, yet only 'aet'
  exists.  either the docs need updating or ae added.

* archer help menu incorrectly calls archer commands "BRL-CAD Commands"

* opendb command doesn't seem to be available.

* archer reports "invalid command" on 'aet' and other commands until a
  database is opened.  it shouldn't.
