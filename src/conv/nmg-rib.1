.SH NAME
nmg-rib \- Convert polygonal NMG to Renderman Interface Bytestream (RIB)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nmg-rib
.RB [-t] database.nmg nmg_solid ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I nmg-rib
program
reads the geometry database
.I database.nmg
and converts the named polygonal NMG solids to RIB format polygons.
If the
.B \-t
option is given, the NMG solid will be triangulated first.
If NMG a vertexuse normal is present for a vertexuse, it is used as the RIB
vertex normal.  Otherwise, the NMG face normal is used.
