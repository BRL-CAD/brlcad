.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g-acad [-vi] [-xX lvl]
[-e error_file] [-D calculation_tolerance ]
[-a abs_tol] [-r rel_tol] [-n norm_tol] [-o ACAD_file] database.g object(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I g-acad\^
converts the specified
.I object(s)
from a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file to the in-house Lockheed Martin's Advanced Computer-Aided Design

option specifies the mame of the file to receive the output
(stdout is the default).
