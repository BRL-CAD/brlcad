.SH NAME
g-acad \- Convert from BRL-CAD format to Lockheed Martin's ACAD format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g-acad [-vi] [-xX lvl]
[-e error_file] [-D calculation_tolerance ]
[-a abs_tol] [-r rel_tol] [-n norm_tol] [-o ACAD_file] database.g object(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I g-acad\^
converts the specified
.I object(s)
from a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file to the in-house Lockheed Martin's Advanced Computer-Aided Design
.I (ACAD)
file format (formerly the General Dynamics ACAD file format).  This converter has NOT connected with Autodesk Inc.'s AutoCAD file format.
The
.I -x
option specifies an RT debug flag and the
.I -X
option specifies an NMG debug flag. The
.I -a
,
.I -r
, and
.I -n
options specifiy tesselation tolerances.
The
.I -D
option specifies a calculational distance tolerance (mm). Any two vertices
that are less than this distance apart will be treated as the same vertex.
The
.I -v
option requests verbose output.
The
.I -i
option requests the output file units to be inches (the default is mm).
The
.I -o
option specifies the mame of the file to receive the output
(stdout is the default).
The
.I -e
option specifies a file for receiving the error messages.
