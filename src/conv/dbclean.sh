# This shell program compacts mged (.g) databases to remove spaces left
# by the kill/killall commands.  This is achieved by converting the
# database to ASCII and then back to .g format.
# Note: when the converters are unable to convert a solid and it is skipped,
# the conversions will go to completion and a new database --- without those
# solids --- results.  Caveat Emptor.

# database name, and a new database name.

# goes to standard out.
# Trap sudden interrupts and clean up any debris left by dbclean at that
