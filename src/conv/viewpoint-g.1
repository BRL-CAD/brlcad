.SH NAME
viewpoint-g \- VIEWPOINT Translator (VIEWPOINT to BRL-CAD)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B viewpoint-g
[-t tolerance] -c input_coordinates_file -e input_elements_file [-o database.g]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I viewpoint-g\^
converts the specified input files to a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file. The
.I tolerance
provided is the maximum distance (in mm) between two
vertices at which they will be considered to be the same vertex. The
.I input_coordinates_file
and the
.I input_elements_file
are expected to be in the
.I VIEWPOINT
triangulated format as provided by
.I Viewpoint Datalabs.
In this format each object is represented as a group of
elements, and each element is a group of triangular facets.
