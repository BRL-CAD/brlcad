.SH NAME
conv-vg2g \- upgrade old to new format binary MGED database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B conv-vg2g
file.vg file.g
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Conv-vg2g
converts several older forms of binary
.IR mged (1)
databases to the current form.
.PP
The conversion from version 3 to version 4 (the current version)
is fairly straightforward.
Conversion from older versions requires additional information,
for which the user is prompted.  The units of the database must
be specified as:
1=mm, 2=cm, 3=meters, 4=inches, 5=feet.
A title for the database is also requested.
.SH SEE ALSO
brlcad(1), mged(1), libged(3)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages are intended to be self-explanatory,
and usually indicate errors in the input database.
It may be possible to rescue a damaged old database
by suitably modifying the source code to the converter.
