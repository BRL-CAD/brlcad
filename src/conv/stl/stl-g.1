.SH NAME
stl-g \- Stereolithography Translator (STL to BRL-CAD)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B stl-g
[-db] [-i initial_ident] [-I constant_ident] [-m material_code] [-N forced_name] [-c units] [-t tolerance] [-x RT_DEBUG_FLAG] file.stl file.g
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I stl-g
converts the specified
.I file.stl
to a BRL-CAD
.I file.g
file. Use the
.I -b
option if you have a binary STL file (the default is ASCII).
The
.I -d
option prints debugging information.
The
.I -c
option specifies the units that are used in the STL file. The
.I units
string may be "mm", "in", "ft", ... (default is "mm").
The
.I -t
option specifies a tolerance distance (in mm) such that any two vertices
within tolerance distance of each other are treated as the same vertex.
The
.I -i
option sets the starting ident number for the regions created. As each
new region is created, this number will be incremented before assigning
the next ident number (conflicts with
.I -I
). The
.I -I
option sets a constant ident number that will be assigned to all the regions created (conflicts with
.I -i
).
The
.I -m
option sets a material code that will be assigned to all the regions created (default is 1).
The
.I -N
option sets a name for the resulting BRL-CAD object. STL files typically do not contain any
object names.
The
.I -x
option sets an RT debug flag (see raytrace.h).
The
.I file.stl
file is expected to be a stereolithography file.
