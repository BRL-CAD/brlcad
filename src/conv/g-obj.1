.SH NAME
g-obj \- BRL-CAD to Wavefront Object File converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g-obj [-mviu] [-xX lvl]
[-e error_file] [-D calculation_tolerance ]
[-a abs_tol] [-r rel_tol] [-n norm_tol] [-o output.obj] database.g object(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I g-obj\^
converts the specified
.I object(s)
from a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file to the
.I Wavefront
.I OBJ
file format.
The
.I -x
option specifies an RT debug flag and the
.I -X
option specifies an NMG debug flag. The
.I -a
,
.I -r
, and
.I -n
options specifiy tesselation tolerances.
The
.I -D
option specifies a calculational distance tolerance (mm). Any two vertices
that are less than this distance apart will be treated as the same vertex.
The
.I -u
option specifies that vertex normals are desired.
The
.I -v
option requests verbose output.
The
.I -i
option requests the output file units to be inches (the default is mm).
The
.I -o
option specifies the mame of the file to receive the output
(stdout is the default).
The
.I -m
option will result in 'usemtl' statements in the output file. These statements are fictional
(they do not refer to any material database). The materials named provide information about
the material codes assigned to the objects in the BRL-CAD database. The material names will be
of the form 'aircode_los_material', where
.I aircode
is the code number for the air represented by that region, if it does represent air,
otherwise this will be zero. The
.I los
is the Line Of Sight thickness (0-100) assigned to the region, and the
.I material
is the material code number assigned.
The
.I -e
option specifies a file for receiving the error messages.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages are intended to be self-explanatory.
