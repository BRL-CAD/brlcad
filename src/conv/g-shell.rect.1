.SH NAME
g-shell.rect \- Produce triangulated shell from BRL-CAD model
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g-shell.rect
[-d debug_level] [-n] [-g cell_size] [-i initial_ray_dir] [-d debug_level] -o brlcad_output_file database.g object(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I g-shell.rect\^
converts the specified
.I objects(s)
from a BRL-CAD model
.I database.g
to a single NMG solid using raytracing. Rays are fired in a uniform grid.
The direction for the first set of rays is chosen by calculating
the presented area of the bounding box of the
.I object(s)
and selecting the direction with the largest area. The user may override this
by specifying a desired initial ray direction using the
.I -i
option (see below).
The initial shell is constructed using only the first and last
intersections with the
.I object(s).
This will typically result in some rather large faces with normals at right angles
to the ray direction. Unless the
.I \-n
option is spcified, these faces are then subdivided (according to the
.I cell_size
) and additional rays fired from the other two directions are used to refine their
shape.
The resulting NMG solid
will be named
.I shell
and will be written to the specified
.I brlcad_output_file.

.PP
The following command line options are recognized:
.TP
.B \-g \fIcell_size\fR
Specify the dimensions (in millimeters) of the grid spacing.  The default is 50mm.
.TP
.B \-i \fIinitial_ray_dir\fR
Specify the initial ray direction.  Valid values are X, Y, or Z.
The best results are usually obtained by raytracing in the direction that produces the
most hits first.

.TP
.B \-d \fIdebug_level\fR
Set the debugging level.  Higher values produce more debugging information.
.TP
.B \-n
Supresses the refinement stage (firing rays from the secondary and tertiary axis directions).
.TP
.B \-o \fIoutput.g\fR
Specifies the name of the BRL-CAD geometry file to create.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages are intended to be self-explanatory.
