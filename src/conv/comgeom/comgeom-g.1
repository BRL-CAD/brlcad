.SH NAME
comgeom-g \- convert GIFT COMGEOM model into MGED database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B comgeom-g
.RB [ \-d\  debug_lvl]
.RB [ \-v\  version_num]
.RB [ \-s\  name_suffix]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a COMGEOM version 4 or version 5 format model from
a GIFT-style input file, convert the geometry into
the internal form used by the BRL-CAD package,
and write an MGED-style binary database.
.PP
Each solid is given the name ``s###'', retaining the COMGEOM solid number.
Each region is given the name ``r###'', retaining the COMGEOM region number.
Regions are grouped together into various groups ``g###'' based
on the region-id numbers.  Group ``g00'' gets all regions with region-id
of zero, ``g0'' gets ids one through 99, ``g1'' gets ids 100 through 199, etc.
.PP
The default input is COMGEOM version 5.
Version 4 can be converted by specifying the
.B \-v4
flag.
For the time being, the DoE MORSE/RAFFLE format (believed to be the
original MAGIC format) can be converted by specifying the
.B \-v1
flag.
.PP
By default, the program
.I comgeom-g
operates silently.
Because the program may require a minute or two to convert a large
database, some users prefer to have various status reports that
indicate the progress of the conversion.
This can be selected by specifying the
.B \-d1
flag (debug level 1).
.PP
The units used in a COMGEOM file are specified on a header record.
The units of an MGED database are always milimeters.
.I comgeom-g
performs automatic units conversion using the built-in units conversion
feature of
\fIlibwdb\fR(3).
.SH EXAMPLE
.I
comgeom-g < file.cg > file.g
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics are intended to be self-explanatory.
Familiarity with GIFT COMGEOM terminology will be helpful.
.SH BUGS
It is expected that the input file should be a valid COMGEOM model.
While quite a bit of input checking is performed, wildly incorrect
input may produce amusing results.
