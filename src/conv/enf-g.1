.SH NAME
enf-g \- Elysium Neutral Format Translator (ENF to BRL-CAD)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B enf-g
[-t tolerance] [-i starting_ident_number] [-l name_length_limit] [-n part_number_to_name_mapping] input_enf_facet_file database.g
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I enf-g\^
converts the specified
.I input_enf_facet_file
to a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file. This input file is expected to be the ASCII output from the Elysium enf2mxp tessellator. The
.I tolerance
provided is the maximum distance (in mm) between two
vertices at which they will be considered to be the same vertex. The
.I starting_ident_number
is the ident number to use for the first region created, each succeeding region will have their
ident numbers incremented by one.
If a
.I name_length_limit
is provided, then the resulting names in the BRL-CAD model will not be longer than
that limit. If a
.I part_number_to_name_mapping
file is provided, then that file will be read and used to convert part numbers in the
.I input_enf_facet_file
to the corresponding names in the mapping. This file is expected to consist of a series
of lines of text with each line having a part number and a legal BRL-CAD object name spearated
by a tab.
