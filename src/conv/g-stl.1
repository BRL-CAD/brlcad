.SH NAME
g-stl \- Stereolithography Translator (BRL-CAD to STL)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g-stl [-b][-v][-i] [-xX lvl]
[-D calculation_tolerance ]
[-a abs_tol] [-r rel_tol] [-n norm_tol] [-o STL_file | -m directory_name] database.g object(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I g-stl\^
converts the specified
.I object(s)
from a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file to the
.I stereolithography
file format.
The
.I -x
option specifies an RT debug flag and the
.I -X
option specifies an NMG debug flag. The
.I -a
,
.I -r
, and
.I -n
options specifiy tesselation tolerances.
The
.I -D
option specifies a calculational distance tolerance (mm). Any two vertices
that are less than this distance apart will be treated as the same vertex.
The
.I -v
option requests verbose output.
The
.I -i
option requests the output file units to be inches (the default is mm).
The
.I -b
option requests binary output (the default in ASCII).
In the case of ASCII output, the region name is specified
on the "solid" line of the STL file. In the case of binary output, all the regions are output
as a single STL part.
The
.I -o
option specifies the name of the file to receive the output
(stdout is the default).
The
.I -m
option specifies the name of a directory where the output files will be placed.
In this case each region converted is written to a separate file
and placed in this directory. The file names are constructed from the full path
names of each region (path from the specified object to the region). Any "/" characters
in the path name are replaced by "@" characters, and "." and white space are replaced by
"_" characters. If the
.I -m
option is not specified, then all the
regions are written to the same file. The
.I -o
and
.I -m
options are mutually exclusive.
