.SH NAME
dxf-g \- DXF Translator (DXF to BRL-CAD)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dxf-g
[-c] [-d] [-v] [-s scale_factor] [-t tolerance] file.dxf database.g
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dxf-g\^
converts the specified
.I file.dxf
to a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file.

The following options are available:

.TP
.B \-c
Only the first color seen for a layer should be used. Without this option,
layers may be broken into seperate BOT primitives according to color assigned.

.TP
.B \-d
Sets a debug flag. The only effect is to cause a core dump on failure.
This is probably not useful except for developers.
.TP
.B \-v
Produces very verbose output on stderr.
.TP
.B \-s \fIscale_factor\fR
Provides a scale factor to be applied to the DXF input. This can be used for DXF files
that do not provide units information.
.TP
.B -t \fItolerance\fR
Specifies the maximum distance (in mm) between two vertices at which the two vertices
will be considered to be the same vertex.

.P
The
.B file.dxf
file is expected to be in the ASCII Autodesk DXF format as defined in the
Autocad 2006 manuals. This converter handles entities of types:
.IP
POLYLINE
.br
LWPOLYLINE
.br
LEADER
.br
DIMENSION
.br
VERTEX
.br
LINE
.br
CIRCLE
.br
ARC
.br
ELLIPSE
.br
3DFACE
.br
TEXT
.br
MTEXT
.br
ATTRIB
.br
SOLID
.br
SPLINE
.P
The POLYLINE entities in AUTOCAD are actually a container for numerous different entity types. The types
of POLYLINE entities converted include:
.IP
3D polylines
.br
3D polygon meshes
.br
polyface meshes.
.P
SOLID entities are 2D shapes with a solid fill, but this converter does not do
any filling.
Each layer is converted to a seperate object. Colors are also converted.

Error messages are intended to be self-explanatory.
.SH "BUG REPORTS"
Reports of bugs or problems should be submitted via electronic
mail to <devs@brlcad.org>.
