.SH NAME
nastran-g \- NASTRAN Translator (NASTRAN to BRL-CAD)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nastran-g
[-t tolerance] [-t tolerance_distance] [-n] [-m] -i nastran_input_file -o database.g
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I nastran-g\^
converts the specified
.I nastran_input_file
to a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file. The
.I tolerance_distance
provided is the maximum distance (in mm) between two
vertices at which they will be considered to be the same vertex. The
.I -n
option requests that the output solids created from
.I NASTRAN CQUAD4
or
.I CTRIA3
elements be stored in the BRL-CAD file as NMG solids rather than the default BOT solids. The
.I -m
option indicates that the units of the NASTRAN file are millimeters, rather than the default
inches. The converter currently only handles the
.I CROD, CBAR, CTRIA3,
and
.I CQUAD4
elements.
