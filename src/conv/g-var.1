.SH NAME
g-var \- Produce (OpenGL) Vertex Arrays from BOT BRL-CAD geometry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g-var
[-v] [-y] [-s scale] [-f] [-o outfile] infile.g object
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I g-var
writes the bag of triangle (BOT) primitives of the specified
.I object
in a binary array format to
.I outfile
or to
.I stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Request verbose output.
.TP
.B \-y
Transform the coordinate system from xyz to xzy.
.TP
.B \-s scale
Scale the output geometry by factor
.B scale
\. By default the scale factor is 0.001 (standard transformation
from meters to millimeters.)
.TP
.B \-f
Flip face normals. This changes both the vertex order and the output normals.
.TP
.B \-o outfile
The output will be written to
.B outfile
\. By default the output is written to stdout.
.SH FILE FORMAT
.I TODO
.SH EXAMPLE
.RS
$ \|\fIg-var \|-o sample.mesh \|sample.g \|sample_object\fP
.RE
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages are intended to be self-explanatory.
