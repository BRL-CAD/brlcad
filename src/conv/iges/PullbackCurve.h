/*
*
* Pull an arbitrary model-space *curve* onto the given *surface* as a
* curve within the surface's domain when, for each point c = C(t) on
* the curve and the closest point s = S(u, v) on the surface, we have:
* distance(c, s) <= *tolerance*.
*
* The resulting 2-dimensional curve will be approximated using the
* following process:
*
* 1. Adaptively sample the 3d curve in the domain of the surface
* (ensure tolerance constraint). Sampling terminates when the
* following flatness criterion is met:
*    given two parameters on the curve t1 and t2 (which map to points p1 and p2 on the curve)
*    let m be a parameter randomly chosen near the middle of the interval [t1, t2]
*                                                              ____
*    then the curve between t1 and t2 is flat if distance(C(m), p1p2) < flatness
*
* 2. Use the sampled points to perform a global interpolation using
*    universal knot generation to build a B-Spline curve.
*
* 3. If the curve is a line or an arc (determined with openNURBS routines),
*    return the appropriate ON_Curve subclass (otherwise, return an ON_NurbsCurve).
