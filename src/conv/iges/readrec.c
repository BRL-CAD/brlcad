/** @file readrec.c
 *
 * This routine reads record number "recno" from the IGES file and
 * places it in the "card" buffer (available for reading by
 * "readstrg", "readint", "readflt", "readtime", "readcols", etc.  The
 * record is located by calculating the offset into the file and doing
 * an "fseek".  This obviously depends on the "UNIX" characteristic of
 * "fseek" understanding offsets in bytes.  The record length is
 * calculated by the routine "recsize".  This routine id typically
 * called before calling the other "read" routines to get to the
 * desired record.  The "read" routines then call this routine if the
 * buffer empties.
