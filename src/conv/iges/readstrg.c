/* This routine reads the next field in "card" buffer
	It expects the field to contain a character string
	of the form "nHstring" where n is the length
	of "string". If "id" is not the null string, then
	"id" is printed followed by "string".  If "id" is null,
	then the only action taken is to read the string
	(effectively skipping the field).

	"eof" is the "end-of-field" delimiter
	"eor" is the "end-of-record" delimiter	*/
