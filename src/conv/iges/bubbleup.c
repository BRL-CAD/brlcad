/** @file iges/bubbleup.c
 *
 * This routine finds union operators in the boolean tree that cannot
 * be handled by BRL-CAD (due to BRL-CAD's odd way of handling the
 * union operator), and moves them toward the root of the tree.  To
 * get the tree into a BRL-CAD-acceptable format, no intersection or
 * subtraction operators can be above any union operator in the tree.
 * Traverses the tree in LRN order.  Returns 1 if no change was made
 * to the tree, 0 otherwise.
