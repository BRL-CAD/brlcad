/** @file recsize.c
 *
 * Routine to determine record size of IGES file.
 *	According to the spec, the file should be
 *	80 characters per record.  The spec does not
 *	mention anything about CR or LF at the end of records,
 *	so this routine looks for LF's and returns the actual
 *	record length.
 *	Note: this will work for files with records that are
 *	80 characters long without any CR or LF at end of records,
 *	also for files with CR-LF at end of records, and for files
 *	with just LF at end of records.  It will not work for files
 *	with just CR at end of records (but I haven't seen such an animal
 *	yet)
 *
