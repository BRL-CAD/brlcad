/** @file readname.c

 * This routine reads the next field in "card" buffer.  It expects the
 * field to contain a character string of the form "nHstring" where n
 * is the length of "string". If "id" is not the null string, then
 * "id" is printed followed by "string".  A pointer to the string is
 * returned in "ptr".
 *
 * "eof" is the "end-of-field" delimiter
 * "eor" is the "end-of-record" delimiter
