.SH NAME
euclid-g \- EUCLID Translator (EUCLID to BRL-CAD)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B euclid-g
euclid_file database.g
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I euclid-g\^
converts the specified
.I euclid_file
to a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file. The
.I euclid_file
is expected to be an ASCII file format that is the "decoded" version
of the Euclid file. The decoded file represents each object as a series
of polygonal faces. Each face may be one of either a simple face (no holes),
a complex face (contains at least one hole), or a simple hole.
This converter creates a region for each object ID number by unioning
together all the objects with the same ID number.
