.SH NAME
g-euclid \- EUCLID Translator (BRL-CAD to EUCLID)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g-euclid [-v] [-xX lvl]
[-a abs_tol] [-r rel_tol] [-n norm_tol] [-o euclid_file] database.g object(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I g-euclid\^
converts the specified
.I object(s)
from a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file to the "decoded"
.I EUCLID
format.
The decoded file represents each object as a series
of polygonal faces. Each face may be one of either a simple face (no holes),
a complex face (contains at least one hole), or a simple hole.
This converter creates a region for each object ID number by unioning
together all the objects with the same ID number. The
.I -x
option specifies an RT debug flag and the
.I -X
option specifies an NMG debug flag. The
.I -a
,
.I -r
, and
.I -n
options specifiy tesselation tolerances. The
.I -o
option specifies the mame of the file to receive the output
(stdout is the default).
