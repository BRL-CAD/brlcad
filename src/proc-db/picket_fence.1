.SH NAME
pickett_fence \- Pickett fence geometry file generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pickett_fence
<filename> <prefix> <height> <spacing> <x0> <y0> <z0> ... <xn> <yn> <zn> [-r]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pickett_fence\^
creates a geometry file in
.I <filename>\^
of a pickett fence.  All parameters for the fence are in mm.  If more than two
points are specified it will generate a fence with multiple sections connecting
the points.  Parts of the fence are created starting at the origin.  The
two backing boards are created in the negative x halfspace.  The pickets are
created in the positive x halfspace and translated down the y-axis to their
proper positions.  The entire segment is then rotated and translated to the
position specified by the user.  To create a box of fence with the
picketts on the outside, the points must be specified in a counter-clockwise
order.  Parts of the model are named according to the format
.RS
<prefix><partname><sec_num>[-<part_num>].<obj_type>
.RE
The
.I <prefix>\^
above is the second argument to the program.  The
.I spacing\^
parameter specifies the ammount of space (in mm) between picketts.  The
.I -r\^
option specifies round fronts for the picketts.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following will create a pickett fence two meters high and six meters long
with fifteen millimeter spaces between the picketts.  It will start at
the origin and extend to the point (100, 6000, 0).
