/** @file naca456.c

 * BRL-CAD's translation of the calculation of coordinates for NACA airfoils is
 * based on the public domain program naca456 written by Ralph Carmichael of
 * Public Domain Aeronautical Software (PDAS):
 *
 * http://www.pdas.com/naca456.html
 *
 * naca456 is in turn based off of earlier work by several authors at NASA,
 * documented in reports NASA TM X-3284, NASA TM X-3069 and NASA TM 4741. The
 * program naca456 is documented in the paper:
 *
 * Carmichael, Ralph L.: Algorithm for Calculating Coordinates of Cambered NACA
 * Airfoils At Specified Chord Locations. AIAA Paper 2001-5235, November 2001.
