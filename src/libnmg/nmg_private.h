/**
 * @brief Internal routine to kill an edge geometry structure (of either
 * type), if all the edgeuses on its list have vanished.  Regardless,
 * the edgeuse's geometry pointer is cleared.
 *
 * This routine does only a single edgeuse.  If the edgeuse mate has
 * geometry to be killed, make a second call.  Sometimes only one of
 * the two needs to release the geometry.
 *
 * @retval 0 If the old edge geometry (eu->g.magic_p) has other uses.
 * @retval 1 If the old edge geometry has been destroyed. Caller beware!
 *
 * NOT INTENDED FOR GENERAL USE!
 * However, it is not unique to mk.c - mod.c needs it for nmg_eusplit().
