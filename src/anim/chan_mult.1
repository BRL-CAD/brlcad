.SH NAME
chan_mult - multiply columns of data by a given factor
.PP
chan_add - add a given value to columns of data
.SH SYNOPSIS
chan_mult factor num_columns column [column column ...] < infile > outfile
.PP
chan_add value num_columns column [column column ...] < infile > outfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mult_chan
will multiply all numbers in the specified columns by the given
factor. The infile is
an ASCII file, with columns separeted by white space. The columns are
numbered from 0 to (n-1).
.I Add_chan
behaves analogously, but with
addition rather than multiplication.
.SH EXAMPLES
These routines are useful for converting between units in animation
tables.
.PP
To multiply all but the first column of a four column file by 2.54:
.PP
.B
chan_mult 2.54 4 1 2 3
.PP
To add ten to the first six columns of an eight-column file:
.PP
.B
chan_add 10.0 8 0 1 2 3 4 5
.PP
To convert the second of three columns from Fahrenheit to Celcius:
.PP
.B
chan_add -32 3 1
.br
.B
chan_mult 0.56 3 1
.SH BUGS
