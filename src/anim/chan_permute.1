.SH NAME
chan_permute - operate on columns of files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chan_permute
.B -i infile1 id id ...
.B [-i infile2 id ...]
.B -o outfile1 id id ...
.B [-o outfile2 id ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program mixes, matches, and merges ASCII files organized in
channels or columns. Each word, separated by whitespaces, should be less
than 40 characters long. The channels in each input file are specified
and then mapped to the desired channels in the output file(s). These are
the sort of things that can be done using
.I cut
and
.I paste,
but when
working on animation tables it's often nice to be able to do it in one
step.
.PP
.BR Infile s
are files to be read from,
.BR outfile s
are files to be written
to, and each
.B id
is a small positive integer identifying a channel. All of the
input
.BR id 's
should be distinct integers, or the results are not guaranteed.
.PP
.I Chan_permute
interprets
.B -i stdin
as standard input and
.B -o stdout
as
standard output.
.SH EXAMPLES
The command
.sp
chan_permute -i foo 0 1 2 -o stdout 2 1 0
.sp
reverses the order of foo's three columns and sends them to standard output.
.sp
.sp
The command
.sp
chan_permute -i file1 0 1 -i file2 2 3 -o file3 2 0 1 -o file4 3 0 1
.sp
creates file3 and file4, each containing one of the columns of file2
followed by both columns of file1.
.SH BUGS
A given file may be referenced
more than once for input, but may not be referenced for input and output
together or output and output together. In the latter case, the second
output reference overrides the other. 	The
.BR id 's
must be integers
somewhere between 0 and the number of arguments, inclusive.
