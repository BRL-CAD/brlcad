.SH NAME
showshot \- generate MGED commands to represent a ray through some geometry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "showshot  [ -n " name " ] [ -r " radius " ] "
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Showshot
reads the specification for a ray through some geometry
and generates
.IR mged (1)
commands to produce a database object representing the ray.
The input should consist of lines of the form
.sp
.ce
.I "object  x_in  y_in  z_in  x_out  y_out  z_out"
.sp
as might be obtained from
.IR nirt (1),
where
.I object
is the name of a database object along the ray,
and
(\fIx_in\fR, \fIy_in\fR, \fIz_in\fR)
and
(\fIx_out\fR, \fIy_out\fR, \fIz_out\fR)
are the points at which the ray enters and exits
.I object,
respectively.
The first and last lines of input are assumed to correspond to
the first and last objects encountered along the ray.
Otherwise, the lines of input may be in any order.

The first
.IR mged (1)
command generated by
.I showshot
produces an RCC
to represent the ray itself.
This cylinder has its vertex at the entry point for the first object
along the ray
and extends to the exit point for the last object\(emall
the other coordinates in the input are ignored.
.I Showshot
then generates commands to make the solid a member of a region,
which is assigned the color 255 255 0 (yellow).
Finally,
.I showshot
generates commands to create a group
that contains the ray region and each of the objects specified in the input.
.SS Options
The command-line options and their meanings are given below.
.TP 12
.BI -n " name"
Specifies that the string
.I name
be used as the root for the names of the new database objects.
The ray solid and ray region will be called
\fIname\fR.s and \fIname\fR.r,
respectively,
and the group will be called
.I name.
Default is ray.\fIPID\fR,
where
.I PID
is the process ID of the
.I showshot
process.
.TP 12
.BI -r " radius"
Specifies that the RCC representing the ray should have a radius of
.I radius
units.
Default is 1.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If
\fIname\fR.s
is longer than the fifteen-character limit imposed by
.IR mged (1)
or the input stream does not conform to the expected format,
then
.IR showshot
complains and exits with status 1.
