Investigate Qt/OSG integration to see if it's usable/workable for this setup:

Work on better/more nuanced and comprehensive Qt stylesheets - right now things
like button appearance depend on whether Qt is installed, for example.

Appleseed's work should be helpful - also maybe look at
https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet


If we decide to look at QML as a possible alternative, these should be checked out:

3rd party widgets of possible interest:

The following might be of interest for scenarios where we were using tktable, if
Qt's built ins aren't enough (one of the license options is LGPL 2.1):

QHexEdit2 might be useful for some low level debugging/inspection features...

Node editor:

Might be able to make a decent CAD console widget out of these:
