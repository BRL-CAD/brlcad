 * TODO - need to support more than just QgToolPaletteElement types
 * being created by plugins.  The four logical candidates so far:
 *
 * 1.  ged-style command line commands  (maybe should expand libged
 *     plugin setup to support hooking them in at that level, but may
 *     also want awareness of app level info in commands...)
 * 2.  QgToolPaletteLElement (currently what we're using)
 * 3.  QDockWidget items, equivalent to (say) the standard attributes
 *     dialog and able to be docked in the main GUI.
 * 4.  Full-fledged dialogs that are their own windows and launched
 *     from the menu.  Candidates might include complex procedural geometry
 *     generation tools, tabular report generators, or other large
 *     grpahical layout scenarios that won't fit well as a widget in
 *     the main GUI.
