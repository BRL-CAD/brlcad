# - Try to find X11 OpenGL
# Once done this will define
#
#  XOPENGL_FOUND            - system has OpenGL
#  XOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR_GL   - the GL include directory
#  XOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR_GLX  - the GLX include directory
#  XOPENGL_LIBRARIES        - Link these to use OpenGL
#
# If you want to use just GL you can use these values
#  XOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY   - Path to OpenGL Library
#  XOPENGL_glu_LIBRARY  - Path to GLU Library
