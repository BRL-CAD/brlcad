primitives
    - CQUAD elements

Boolean operations:
    - Unions on primitives may be representable using the WALL record.
    - If an fg4 primitive has a facetized object subtracted from it, the facetized object will currently not be output (tree appears empty).
    - HOLE records do not (appear to) propagate up to other HOLE/WALL records
    - Objects subtracted using HOLE records must be completely enclosed within the containing object.
