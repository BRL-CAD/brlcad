GRID record limit:
    - fastgen4 permits 50k GRID records per Section, and this is enforced by the export plugin.
    - this limit is exceeded by db/goliath.g, for which the "toplevels" Section accumulates a very large number of primitives existing outside of regions.

Boolean operations:
    - Objects subtracted using HOLE records must be completely enclosed within the containing object.
