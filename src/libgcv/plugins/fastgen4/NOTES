GRID record limit:
    - FASTGEN permits 50k GRID records per SECTION, and this is enforced by the export plugin.
    - This limit is exceeded by db/goliath.g, for which the "toplevels" SECTION accumulates a very large number of primitives existing outside of regions.
    - TODO: Fix by treating each toplevel primitive as a region

Boolean operations:
    - The FASTGEN format can represent only a very limited subset of Boolean operations
    - Objects subtracted using HOLE records must be completely enclosed within the containing object.

Facetization is required when geometry can not be directly represented by the FASTGEN format:
    - Primitives or Boolean operations that can't be represented
    - Regions containing two or more objects that require different modes (Plate or Volume) for the SECTION
