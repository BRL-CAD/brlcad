Fastgen4 exporter known limitations:
    1. Does not treat toplevel objects as separate regions
           - Causes db/goliath.g to exceed FASTGEN's maximum number of GRID
             entries per SECTION
    2. Does not support writing the HOLE object
           - Support for HOLE would allow deprecated CCONE1 objects to be
             replaced automatically even if they can't be represented by a CCONE2
           - Note: It is a FASTGEN requirement that objects subtracted using HOLE
             records be completely enclosed within the containing object
    3. Proper use of Plate/Volume SECTION modes


Design:
    Facetization is required when geometry can not be directly represented by the
    FASTGEN format:
        - Primitives or Boolean operations that can't be represented
        - Regions containing two or more objects that require different modes
          (Plate/Volume) for the SECTION
