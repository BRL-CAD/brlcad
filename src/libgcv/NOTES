Included below are notes on the design and implementation of the
Geometry Conversion Library (LIBGCV).


ARCHITECTURE
============

From an architecture standpoint, here are a few tenants that LIBGCV
should adhere to:

1) Minimal library dependencies.  It needs to drop into external codes
without needing more than BRL-CAD's core libraries (libbu, libbn,
libwdb, librt, libbrep).  Stand-alone distribution is a requirement.

2) Public C or C++ API, not both.  If it's a C++ API, it shouldn't
have free-floating global functions.  If it's a C API, it shouldn't
expose C++ types in the public API without compilation safeguards.

3) API independence.  Each added geometry format should extend LIBGCV
without requiring ANY change to the public API.  That means we should
not have an enum or #defines or public functions that embed a format
(e.g., no public gcv_obj_to_g() functions).

4) Plugin architecture.  Each format should require only one
line/block be added to some GCV initialization function (or
dynamically loaded at runtime) to register itself.  Ideally, each
format lives in a sub-directory self-contained.

5) Simplicity, consistency.  The API design should declare minimal
symbols, types, structs, functions, designs.  It should follow
conventions of our existing libraries in terms of conventions and
patterns.


API DESIGN
==========

T.B.D.

By design, this library is intended to be useful for reading and
writing 3D geometry.  The public API design is intentionally very
simple while supporting a number of file formats and geometry
representation types.

Supported file formats for reading and/or writing currently includes
the following formats: OBJ, STL, VRML, FASTGEN4, and BRL-CAD.

The library includes support for a number of implicit and explicit
geometry representation types including Bags o' Triangles (triangle
mesh geometry), n-Manifold polgyonal meshes, volumetric data, NURBS,
and implicit primitives with constructive solid geometry (CSG) Boolean
operations.


NEW FORMATS
===========

Adding a few notes on libraries that may be worth investigating to see
if they have parsing logic that would help in developing convertors
for various formats.  They may amount to nothing, but are worth
checking.

Note that the Coin3D library is now 3-clause BSD as well, a better
source from a licensing standpoint for extracting parsers etc.:

AutoCAD dwg - none (opendwg not compatible with BRL-CAD licensing)

Solidworks (.sat, .sldprt, .sldasm)
No external libraries apparent, probably unlikely
src/external/Cubit/g-sat.cpp should be  useful as a starting point.

Parasolid/UGS
No external libraries apparent, probably unlikely

Haven't found anything with a compatible license...

Blender

Apparently their file format is a bit... weird.  Possibly useful notes
here:

http://www.blender.org/development/architecture/notes-on-sdna/

Since blender is GPL, unlikely their code can be used directly. Since
their storage format seems to be close to their data structures, it
might be worth contacting the project and asking specifically about
the parsing code, if they have the flexibility to sub-license just
that piece as LGPL.

Update: From discussions at SIGGRAPH Blender forum, unlikely they have
flexibility to relicense anything.  Much more interestingly, Gamekit
was announced there which DOES import Blender files and is MIT
licensed:

http://code.google.com/p/gamekit/

Exporting Blender may be impractical (i.e. no well defined format to
target) but as Blender has importers for a wide variety of formats
exporting to Blender directly may not be necessary
