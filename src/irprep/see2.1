.SH NAME
see2 \- reads the file created by showtherm and draws a picture
on the screen, in an SGI environment, giving an appropriate
color to each pixel based on the temperature
.SH SYNOPSIS
see2
.SH DESCRIPTIONS
See2 is an interactive program that reads the information in the file
created by showtherm and then draws an image on the screen.  The color
of each pixel is based on the temperature of the region that pixel
belongs to.
.sp
See2 is designed to be run in an SGI environment (see program see
for other environments).
.SH EXAMPLE
The following is an example from an interactive session.
.nf
