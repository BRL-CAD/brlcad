 *  Ray Tracing program RTHIDE bottom half.
 *
 *  This module utilizes the RT library to interrogate a MGED
 *  model and plots a hidden-line removed UnixPlot file.
 *  This is accomplished by comparing region-id codes between
 *  pixels.  A vertical or horizontal line is plotted when a change in
 *  region-id codes is detected.
 *
 *  At present, the main use for this module is to generate
 *  UnixPlot file that can be read by various existing filters
 *  to produce a bas-relief line drawing of an MGED object: i.e.
 *  flat when viewed head-on, but with relief detail when seen at
 *  an angle.

 *  This routine serves to swap buffer pointers: i.e., one buffer is read
 *  at a time.  The first buffer read becomes the "bottom buffer" the new
 *  buffer becomes the "top buffer".  Once the vertical comparison between
 *  the two buffers has been done, the "top buffer" now becomes the "bottom
 *  buffer" and is retained, while the erstwhile "bottom buffer" is the new
 *  "top buffer", which is overwritten when the next line of information is
 *  read.
 *  This routine takes as its parameters the address of two pointers to buffers.
 *  It manipulates these, but returns nothing.
