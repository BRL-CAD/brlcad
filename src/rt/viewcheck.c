/** @file rt/viewcheck.c
 *
 * Ray Tracing program RTCHECK bottom half.
 *
 * This module outputs overlapping partitions, no other information.
 * The partitions are written to the output file (typically stdout) as
 * BRL-UNIX-plot 3-D floating point lines, so that they can be
 * processed by any tool that reads UNIX-plot.  Because the BRL UNIX
 * plot format is defined in a machine independent way, this program
 * can be run anywhere, and the results piped back for local viewing,
 * for example, on a workstation.
 *
 * ToDo: It would be nice if we could pass in (1) an overlap depth
 * tolerance, (2) choose either region pair or solid pair grouping.
