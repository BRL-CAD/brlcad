/** @file rt_simple.c
 *
 * a minimal raytracing application in BRLCAD.
 *
 * The primary BRL-CAD ray-tracing API consists of calls to the function
 * rt_shootray().  This function takes a single argument, the address of a
 * data structure called the "application" structure.  This data structure
 * contains crucial information, such as the origin and direction of the ray
 * to be traced, what to do if the ray hits geometry, or misses everything.
 * While the application struct is a large and somewhat complex looking one,
 * (it is defined in h/raytrace.h) there are really very few items in it
 * which the application programmer must know about. These are:
 *
 *	a_rt_i		The "rt instance" from a call to rt_dirbuild()
 *	a_ray		The ray origin and direction
 *	a_hit		A routine that is called when the ray overlaps geometry
 *	a_miss		A routine that is called when the ray misses everything
 *
 * Most of the work an application performs will be done in the "hit" routine.
 * This user-supplied routine gets called deep inside the raytracing library
 * under rt_shootray().  It is provided with 3 parameters:
 *
 *	ap		A pointer to the application structure passed to
 *				rt_shootray()
 *	PartHeadp	A list of ray "partitions" which overlap geometry
 *	segp		A list of ray "segments" which were used to create the
 *				partitions
 *
 * Most applications can ignore the last parameter.  The PartHeadp parameter
 * is a linked-list of "partition" structures (defined in "raytrace.h").
 * It is the job of the "hit" routine to process these ray/object intersections
 * to do the work of the application.
