.SH NAME
rtpp \- raytrace an \fBmged\fP model, writing a GIFT-style Pretty Picture file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rtpp
[ options ... ]
model.g
objects ...
> model.pp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rtpp
operates on the indicated
.I objects
in the input
.I model.g
and produces a GIFT-style ``pretty picture'' format file
on standard output.
The orientation of the rays to be fired may be specified by
the
.B \-a
and
.B \-e
options, in which case the model will be autosized, and the grid
will be centered on the centroid of the model, with ray spacing
chosen to span the entire set of
.I objects.
Alternatively,
with the
.B \-M
option, a transformation matrix may be provided on standard input
which maps model-space to view-space.
In this case, the grid ranges from -1.0 <= X,Y <= +1.0 in view space,
with the size of the grid (number of pixels) specified with
.B \-f
This option is most useful when
.B rtpp
is being invoked from a shell script created by an
.IR mged (1)
\fIsaveview\fR command.
.LP
The following options are recognized.
.TP
.B \-f#
Number of pixels in X and Y directions (square grid).
Default is 512 (512x512), maximum is 1024 (1024x1024).
.TP
.B \-a#
Select azimuth in degrees.  Used with
.B \-e
and conflicts With
.B \-M
.TP
.B \-e#
Select elevation in degrees.  Used with
.B \-a
and conflicts with
.B \-M
.TP
.B \-M
Read model2view matrix from standard input.
Conflicts with
.B \-a
and
.B \-e
.TP
.B \-x#
Set debug flags to (hexadecimal) number.  Not generally useful.
.LP
The
.B rtpp
program is a simple front-end to
.IR librt (3)
which is most useful when used with
.IR mged (1).
In order to display a pretty-picture file,
the programs
.IR pp-ik (1)
and
.IR pp-fb (1)
are used.

gift(1V), mged(1), pp-ik(1), pp-fb(1),
rt(1), rayplot(1), rayvect(1), rtpp(1), rtray(1),
librt(3), ray(5V).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Numerous error conditions are possible.
Descriptive messages are printed on standard error (file descriptor 2).

.SH BUGS
Most deficiencies observed while using the
.B rtpp
program are usually with the
.IR librt (3)
package instead.
.SH "BUG REPORTS"
Reports of bugs or problems should be submitted via electronic
mail to <devs@brlcad.org>.
