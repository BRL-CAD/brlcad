/** @file rt/rtregis.c
 *
 * This is a program will register a Unix-Plot file with its companion
 * pix file.  It is assumed that both images were ray-traced at the
 * same rotation.  A homogeneous transformation matrix is constructed
 * from the RT log files of the two images.  This matrix will permit
 * the translation and scaling of the plot file so that it can be
 * readily overlaid onto its pixel image mate.
 *
 * It is expected that the first log file given corresponds to the
 * image file to be overlaid onto the image that corresponds to the
 * second log file.  Also for the moment it is expected that the first
 * log will correspond to a Unix-Plot file, whereas the second will
 * correspond to a pixel file.  If both images where Unix-Plot files,
 * they can be overlaid by simply concatenating them: "cat file.plot3
 * file.plot3 >> out.plot3"
 *
 * The program consists of three parts:

 * 1) take view, orientation, eye_position, and size from two rt log
 *    files, and use this information to build up the registration
 *    matrix;
 * 2) puts out a registration matrix and a new space command to be
 *    used by plrot in lieu of -a#, -e#, -g to rotate/transform the
 *    UNIX_Plot file; and
 * 3) involve pix-fb -o to do the overlaying of the actual files.
 * 4) Note: two pixel files (one lo-res, one hi-res) will be
 *    registered later in a slightly different way.
