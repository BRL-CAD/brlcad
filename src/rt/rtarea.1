.SH NAME
rtarea \- Calculate exposed surface area
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rtarea
[ options ... ]
model.g

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rtarea
calculates the exposed surface area of specified geometry objects from a particular view.  It presently does not compute the entire surface area of objects displayed though that would be a nice feature to have.
The model geometry is the list of
.I objects
in the input database
.IR model.g .

Set rtarea debug flags to (hexadecimal) number.
A flag value of 1 causes 3-D plot output to be written to stdout.
All solid RPPs are plotted as grey boxes, and the walk path is
in alternating blue and green segments.
A flag value of 2 adds red segments for all attempted steps,
as well as the final steps.
A flag value of 3 adds some debugging prints to stderr in addition
to the plots.  This is useful for immediate path review, eg,
