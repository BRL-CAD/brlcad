.SH NAME
cad_boundp \- find bounding polygon of two-dimensional view
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cad_boundp
[
.B \-i
input
] [
.B \-o
output
] [
.B \-t
tolerance
] [
.B \-v
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I cad_boundp\^
reads from
.I input\^
(standard input if not specified)
a series of line segment endpoint
.RI ( x\^ , y\^ )
coordinate values
describing a two-dimensional view
of the edges of a
(possibly transparent)
three-dimensional object
and writes to
.I output\^
(standard output if not specified)
the
.RI ( x\^ , y\^ )
coordinates
of vertices of the bounding polygon
in counter-clockwise order,
starting with the vertex
having the smallest
.I y\^
coordinate.
If the
.B \-v
argument is used,
instead of points
the output will consist of
line segment data
suitable for input into
another invocation of
.IR cad_boundp\^ .
.P
Input lines not beginning with a number
are silently skipped.
This feature can be used to
accommodate comments or
additional control information
in the data stream.
.P
When a
.I tolerance\^
is specified,
a point is considered to be identical
to a previously-input point
if its
.I x\^
and
.I y\^
coordinates are both within
.I tolerance\^
of the first point encountered
within a group passing the tolerance test.
Otherwise,
point coordinates must match precisely
or the algorithm will produce
erroneous results.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.I cad_boundp\^
may output a polygon
smaller than desired
or produce a
``degenerate input''
message
if the
.I tolerance\^
is too tight
or if input is incomplete.
It may be wise to specify
double the expected
.IR tolerance\^ .
.P
Holes within the view
cannot be recognized.
.P
Silhouette thickness must everywhere exceed
.I tolerance\^
(no narrow necking-down)
or a portion of the silhouette
will be ``lost'';
in particular,
the view should not consist of
disjoint parts.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Any error condition causes
.I cad_boundp\^
to terminate
with non-zero exit status
after it prints an error message
on the standard error output.
.P
An illegal argument
or improperly formatted input
produces an appropriate message.
.P
If a vertex
having only one line segment
connected to it
is found on the perimeter,
.I cad_boundp\^
produces the message
``degenerate input''.
.P
If there is too much data for
.I cad_boundp\^
to handle,
the message
``out of memory''
is produced.
