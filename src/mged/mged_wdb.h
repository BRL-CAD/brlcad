 * MGED shared rtg_headwdb resource.
 *
 * Normally wdb_obj.c doesn't use shared global resources with MGED.  However,
 * in this case we are using a variable that was originally global to librt
 * itself, and was thus common to both.
 *
 * Until it's clear what the implications are of having a separate headwdb for
 * the wdb_obj.c code, we'll share this one particular variable.
