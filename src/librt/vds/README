                     Dr. David Patrick Luebke.

VDSlib is a software package that implements view-dependent simplification, 
a geometric level-of-detail algorithm for managing the complexity of polygonal 
scenes for interactive 3-D graphics. Unlike traditional approaches, which 
compute discreet levels of detail for each object in a preprocess, VDSlib 
computes a data structure from which the desired level of detail can be 
dynamically extracted at run-time.

For details of the algorithm, see the SIGGRAPH paper:

-- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>, Sun, 20 Feb 2000

Modified the example polyview program to get it to compile with FLTk (free,
available in main as libfltk1 and libfltk-dev) instead of XForms
(non-free, available as libforms0.89 and libforms-dev).  I have also
added extern "C" { ... } linkage specifications to vds' headers.
