/**
 * Read a polygon file and convert it to an NMG shell
 *
 * A polygon file consists of the following:
 *
 * The first line consists of two integer numbers: the number of
 * points (vertices) in the file, followed by the number of polygons
 * in the file.  This line is followed by lines for each of the
 * vertices.  Each vertex is listed on its own line, as the 3tuple "X
 * Y Z".  After the list of vertices comes the list of polygons.
 * each polygon is represented by a line containing 1) the number of
 * vertices in the polygon, followed by 2) the indices of the
 * vertices that make up the polygon.
 *
 * Implicitly returns r->s_p which is a new shell containing all the
 * faces from the polygon file.
 *
 * XXX This is a horrible way to do this.  Lee violates his own rules
 * about not creating fundamental structures on his own...  :-)
 * Retired in favor of more modern tessellation strategies.
