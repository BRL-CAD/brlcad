.SH NAME
orle\(hypix \- convert old run-length encoded image to RGB pixel format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B orle-pix
.RB [ \-dv ]
.RB [ \-b
{
.B rgbwBG
}] [file.rle]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I orle-fb\^
decodes an old University of Utah standard (Edition-2)
Run-Length Encoded (RLE) format file
(saved with
.IR fb-orle\^ (1),
.IR pix-orle (1),
or a similar program),
converts it into
.IR pix\^ (5)
format, and writes it to standard out.
If
.I file.rle\^
is not specified, standard input is read.
.I orle-pix\^
determines the type and size of the saved file (color or B&W)
and acts accordingly.
If a non-linear colormap is stored in the RLE file,
is is applied to the pixels as they are output.
.TP
.B \-d
Debug option, provides verbose description of file structure and
processes called, written on standard error.
.TP
.B \-v
Provides a verbose description of the parameters of the saved image
on standard error.
.TP
.BI \-b x\^
The background of the image is
normally set to the value recorded in the RLE file.
This option permits
the user to specify an alternate background color from a limited
set of colors.
The character
.I x
can be any of
.B r
(red),
.B g
(green),
.B b
(blue),
.B w
(white),
.B B
(black), or
.B G
(18% grey).
.TP
.I file.rle\^
Name of file to decode, in old RLE format.
