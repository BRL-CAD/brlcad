.SH NAME
pl\(hytek \- convert UnixPlot to Tektronix 4014 command stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pl-tek
.RB [ \-e ]
.RB [ \-v ]
< file.pl [ > file.tek ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pl-tek
converts an extended UnixPlot file to a Tektronix 4014 command stream
suitable for viewing on a Tektronix display,
or a Tektronix-compatible emulator.
The (binary) Tektronix command stream is written to stdout.
.P
The
.B -e
option expands the drawing area on the Tektronix to the full 4096x4096,
which is more than a real Tektronix can display.
It it not known if this feature is useful.
.P
The
.B -v
option turns on \fIverbose\fR mode, and each command is logged to stderr.
Occasionally useful for debugging Tektronix emulator problems,
but is very verbose.
.P
To send a Unix-plot to an Imagen printer, this command can be used:

.nf
	\fIpl-tek < file.pl | ipr -Ltektronix -q im101\fR
.fi
.P
All UnixPlot line types are supported.
.P
If no UnixPlot
.B space
directive is seen, the default space ranges from
(-32767, -32767) to (32767, 32767).
.SH BUGS
Circle and arc directives are not supported.
