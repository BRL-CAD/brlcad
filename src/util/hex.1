.SH NAME
hex \- Hexadecimal and ASCII dump
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hex
.I
[
.I \-o offset
]
[
.I file .\|.\|.
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Hex
reads each
.I file
in sequence and
produces a dump on the standard output
in hexadecimal and ASCII.  If no files are specified on the command
line,
.I hex
checks to to be sure the standard input is not comming from a terminal
before dumping from the standard input.
.LP
Input is
dumped 16 bytes at a time.  The program displays the offset
from the begining of the file/input
in hexadecimal, followed by
the hexadecimal representations for the
next 16
bytes of data, and their ASCII character representations.  Non-printing
characters are displayed as a period (".") in the ASCII section.  Vertical
bars delimit the ASCII section.
.LP
If multiple files are specified on the command line, each file's name is
printed before its dump.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-o offset
start printing at byte position
.I offset
instead of at the begining of the data.
.I Offset
is rounded down to a multiple of 16.
