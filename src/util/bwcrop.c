/** @file bwcrop.c
 *
 * Crop Black and White files.
 *
 * Given four "corner points" in the input file, we produce an
 * output file of the requested size consisting of the nearest
 * pixels.  No filtering/interpolating is done.
 *
 * This can handle arbitrarily large files.
 * We keep a buffer of scan lines centered around the last
 * point that fell outside of the buffer.
 * Note: this buffer code is shared with bwscale.c
