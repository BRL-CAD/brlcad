.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pixuntile
performs the inverse operation of
.IR pixtile (1).
It takes a large image composed of a collection of small images and
places each of them in a separate file.
The input and output files are
assumed to be in
.IR pix (5)
format.
By default, the input file is assumed to be 512x512 pixels in size.
Specifying the
.B \-h
flag, changes the default input size to 1024x1024 pixels.
.PP
The output files have a default width of 64 pixels
and are usually square, i.e. have the same height as width.
Specifying the
.B \-S
flag, changes the default size to
.I squareoutsize
pixels in width and height.
.PP
The files being produces as output will have names of the form
.IR basename.num ,
where
.I basename
is given on the command line, and
.I num
is a consecutive series of integers.  By default the first image
is assumed to be number `` 0 '', but an alternate
.I startframe
can be given by using the
.BI \-o\  startframe
flag and specifying the starting output frame number, where
.I startframe
is substituted for
.I num
in
.I basename.num
.PP
Alternatively, if more than one
.I basename
(filename) argument is supplied on the command line,
the names of the files are used as the output file names.
.SH EXAMPLE
.I
pixuntile \-h \-S 128 out\ \<\ in.pix
.br
will read the 1024x1024 file
.I in.pix
and place the 128x128 chucks of that file from
lower left to upper right in the files
.I out.0
through
.IR out.15 .
