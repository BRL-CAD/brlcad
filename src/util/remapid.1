.SH NAME
remapid \- reassign region idents in a BRL-CAD or TANKILL model according to commands in a specification file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B remapid
.RB [\-{g|t}] {file.g|file.tankill} [spec_file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Performs batch modifications of region IDs for BRL-CAD
(or TANKILL) geometry.
The program reads a .g (or TANKILL) file and a spec file
indicating which region IDs to change to which new values.
For a .g file, the specified changes are made to that file;
For a TANKILL file, a modified model is written to stdout.
The remapping assignment is read from a specification file
containing commands, the grammar for which looks something like:
.nf

command  --> id_list ':' id
id_list  --> id_block | id_block ',' id_list
id_block --> id | id '-' id
id       --> [0-9]+

.fi
The semantics of a command is:  For every region in the database
whose region ID appears in the id_list before the ':', change its
region ID to the value appearing after the ':'.
