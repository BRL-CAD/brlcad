.IX pcd-pix
.SH NAME
pcd-pix \- convert a Photo-CD (tm) file into a pix(5) file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pcd-pix
[options] file.pcd
.SH DESCRIPTION
pcd-pix reads a Photo-CD (tm) Image file or Overview file and
extracts the desired image at one of six resolutions.
By default, the
.IR pix (5)
or
.IR bw (5)
file will be written to stdout.
By giving the optional
.B \-p
flag, the image will be displayed onto the current framebuffer instead.
(See
.IR pix\-fb (1)
for details).
.PP
Photo-CD disks are recorded in ISO 9660 format,
and can be mounted as part of the normal filesystem on most machines.
The primary Image files are located in
photo_cd/images/img####.pcd, where #### is the 4-digit frame number.
The Overview file is found one level up, in "photo_cd/overview.pcd".
.PP
File names may be specified by their full name, or they
may be specified as a positive integer.
When given in this shortened form,
.IR pcd-pix (1)
will look for the file "img####.pcd" in the current directory.
Note that Photo-CD files are just data files, and can be copied from
the CD-ROM onto another filesystem with impunity.
.PP
Photo-CD images are recorded in a three-channel luminance and
chrominance format called YCC,
similar to the YUV format used in CCIR 601 ("D-1")
digital television.
The chrominance data is sampled at half the bandwidth of the chrominance
data.
The image data is gamma corrected during the scanning process
before being recorded on the CD-ROM, so any additional gamma correction
in your display should be disabled, typically by giving the command
.br
    fbgamma 1
.br
If this is not done, the image will be gamma-corrected twice, resulting
in a very washed-out looking picture.
You may need to experiment with values ranging from 0.7 to 1.4,
depending on your monitor.
It is believed that the original gamma correction was 2.2 as per
the NTSC television specification.
.PP
The choice of resolutions,
the reduced chrominance resolution, and the early gamma correction
all seem to be a result of Kodak's having originally intended the home
Photo-CD player and television set combination to be the replacement
for the 35mm slide projector.
These choices are less than
optimal for serious professional applications,
but good results can still be obtained
by being aware of them.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -b
The
.B -b
flag will skip the color reconstitution process, and output the
unmodified luminance (Y) data as a
.IR bw (5)
file.
.TP
.B -i
Print five lines of information from the fileheader to stderr.
This option works only for
Image files.
The first line (Id1) describes the file format, and is alway PCD_IPI.
The second line (Id2) describes the film type, speed, and
frame number from the original film roll.
The third line (Id3) describes the scanning hardware used,
and the fourth line (Id4) gives the name of the processing house.
The fifth line (Id5) is usually blank.
.TP
.B -x
Extended color resolution mode, or "Overskip Mode".
Works on Base/16, Base/4, Base and 4Base, but not 16Base.
In Photo-CD images the luma channel is stored in full resolution, the
two chroma channels are stored in half resolution only and have to be
interpolated. In the Overskip Mode the chroma channels of the next
higher resolution are used, instead of interpolating. This gives
more accurate results because all the lower resolution images are digitally
derived from the original 16Base scan.
.TP
.B -1 | -Base/16 | -128x192
Extract the Base/16 size picture.
.TP
.B -2 | -Base/4 | -256x384
Extract the Base/4 size picture.
.TP
.B -3 | -Base | -512x768
Extract the Base size picture.
When no size option is given, this is the default resolution.
.TP
.B -4 | -4Base | -1024x1536
Extract the 4Base size picture.
.TP
.B -5 | -16Base | -2048x3072
Extract the 16Base size picture.
.TP
.B -0 | -Overview | -O
Extract all pictures from an Overview file, and write them
as a stream of Base/16 (192 by 128) images on stdout.
The file must be "photo_cd/overview.pcd".
For example, to view the overview images:
.sp .5
   pcd-pix -0 overview.pcd | pixtile -w192 -n128 -S1024 -- - | pix-fb -h
.sp .5
Similarly,
.IR pixbustup (1)
could be used to write the overview stream into a set of numbered files.
.TP
.B -p
This flag causes
.IR pix\-fb (1)
to be run via
.IR popen (3)
to immediately display the image on the current framebuffer.
This option was implemented in lieu of creating a separate
.IR pcd-fb (1)
program.
.TP
.B -h
This flag, when given in conjunction with other flags and a file name,
will output a BRL-CAD format option string
of the form
.br
    -w768 -n512
.br
for the currently selected image size.
This is useful when writing shell scripts that may operate on
several Photo-CD resolutions interchangeably.
In this way,
the Photo-CD sizes don't need to be hard coded into the shell script.
.SH BUGS
I still don't have enough information about the Photo-CD to
take care of all data structures. The information I have is
quite vague and this program was developed by starring at
hex-dumps and the famous trial-and-error-method. :-)
.PP
No assurance is made that this program will read any particular
Photo-CD CD-ROM, although in practice it has done well, so far.
It has not been tested with multi-session CD-ROMs.
.PP
When processing 4Base and 16Base images, a substantial amount of dynamic
memory is used.  If
.IR pcd-pix (1)
fails with an "out of memory" error, you may need to configure more
swap space on your machine, or add more RAM, or both.
As a general guide, for 16Base images 32 MBytes is not enough, 64 MBytes is.
