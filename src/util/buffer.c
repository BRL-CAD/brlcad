/** @file buffer.c
 *
 * This program is intended to be use as part of a complex pipeline.
 * It serves somewhat the same purpose as the Prolog "cut" operator.
 * Data from stdin is read and buffered until EOF is detected, and
 * then all the buffered data is written to stdout.  An arbitrary
 * amount of data may need to be buffered, so a combination of a 1
 * Mbyte memory buffer and a temporary file is used.
 *
 * The use of read() and write() is prefered over fread() and fwrite()
 * for reasons of efficiency, given the large buffer size in use.
