/** @file buffer.c
 *
 *  This program is intended to be use as part of a complex pipeline.
 *  It serves somewhat the same purpose as the Prolog "cut" operator.
 *  Data from stdin is read and buffered until EOF is detected, and then
 *  all the buffered data is written to stdout.  An arbitrary amount of
 *  data may need to be buffered, so a combination of a 1 Mbyte memory buffer
 *  and a temporary file is used.
 *
 *  The use of read() and write() is prefered over fread() and fwrite()
 *  for reasons of efficiency, given the large buffer size in use.
