.SH NAME
pixdsplit \- disentangle chars from doubles in a
.IR pixd (5)
stream
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR pixdsplit " [options] [infile]"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pixdsplit
separates out interwoven characters and doubles
from a single input stream.
It treats the stream as consisting of successive ``pixels'',
each of which is made up of
.I n
unsigned chars
followed by
.I m
64-bit doubles,
and writes the chars to one output stream
and the doubles to another.
The pixels are read from
.I infile
if it is specified;
otherwise,
.I pixdsplit
reads from the standard input.

.SS Options
The command-line options and their meanings are:
.\"
.TP 12
.BI -c " charfile"
Causes
.I pixdsplit
to write the chars to the specified file.
If
.I charfile
is the empty string,
then
.I pixdsplit
does not write out the chars.
Default is ``-'',
so the chars are written to the standard output.
.\"
.TP 12
.BI -d " doublefile"
Causes
.I pixdsplit
to write the doubles to the specified file.
If
.I doublefile
is the empty string,
then
.I pixdsplit
does not write out the doubles.
Default is ``'',
so the doubles are not output.
.\"
.TP 12
.BI -# " n.m"
Defines a pixel to be made up of
.I n
unsigned chars and
.IR m
64-bit doubles,
where
.IR n " and " m
are positive integers.
Either of
.IR n " and " m
(but not both)
may be omitted
and if
.I m
is omitted,
then the separating period, too, may be omitted.
The variable for which a value was omitted
retains its previous value.
By default,
.IR n " = 3"
and
.IR m " = 1",
so
the input stream is assumed to be in
.IR pixd (5)
format
as produced by the
.I "-d"
option of
.IR rt (1).
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
The command

.nf
.in +4
pixdsplit file.pixd | pix-fb
.in -4
.fi

extracts the
.IR pix (5)
data from
.I file.pixd,
sending it for display to
.IR pix-fb (1),
while

.nf
.in +4
pixdsplit -# 3.2 -c '' -d coords datafile
.in -4
.fi

ignores the RGB information in
.I datafile
but writes its pairs of doubles to
.I coords.
