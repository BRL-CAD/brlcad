.SH NAME
plgetframe \- extract one frame from a UNIX plot file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B plgetframe
.RB [ \-v ]
desired_frame < unix_plot
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Plgetframe
extracts a single frame from a multi-frame UNIX plot file.
Frames are separated by UNIX plot "erase" commands.
Specifying the
.B \-v
(verbose) flag causes the number of each frame being skipped to
be printed on stderr.
.PP
Note that BRL 3-D UNIX plot is a superset of the standard UNIX plot
format, thus this program can process normal plot files as well.
