.SH NAME
bwfilter \- apply a 3x3 filter to a black and white bw file
.SH SYNOPSIS

.RB [ \-v ]
.RB [ \-d\  div]
.RB [ \-o\  offset]
.RB [ \-s\  squaresize]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Bwfilter
applies one of several 3x3 kernel filters to a black and white
.IR bw (5)
format file.
It will take a file name or else read from standard input.
The input file size will be assumed to be 512x512
pixels unless the
.BR \-s ,
.BR \-w ,
or
.B \-n
flags are used to tell it otherwise (see
.IR brlcad (1)).
By default a low pass filter is used.  The
.BI \-f\  type
flag can be used to specify a different type of filter.
.PP
The
.I type
choices include:
.TP
.B lo
low pass, the default.
.TP
.B hi
high pass
.TP
.B vg
vertical gradient
.TP
.B hg
horizontal gradient
.TP
.B la
laplacian
.TP
.B b
boxcar low pass
.PP
Most filters divide the result of the kernel mutiplication
by some value about in order to scale it back to a 0->255 range.
For example, the boxcar divides by nine.  The
.B -d
flag can be used to change this divisor.
Some filters also add an offset to their results.  The output of
a laplacian for example is "centered" about zero, thus it
adds 128 to the answer to yield a difference from neutral grey.
The
.B \-o
flag can bw used to change this offset.
.PP
The
.B \-v
flag displays the kernel values on standard error.
.SH BUGS
This should allow any 3x3 kernel to be specified.
