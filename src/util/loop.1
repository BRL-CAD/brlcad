.SH NAME
loop \- generate numerical indices for shell loops, etc
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B loop
start finish [increment]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Loop\^
generates a sequence of numbers between
.I start
and
.I finish
inclusive, one per line, on stdout.
This is mostly useful for driving loops when writing Shell programs
.IR sh (1).
The default increment is +1 when start<finish, and -1 when start>finish.
An optional
.I increment
may be specified.
If
.I increment
is zero, then the
.I start
value will be generated continuously.
.P
Both floating point and integer arguments can be used.  On
integer arguments, if leading zeros are specified, they will
be preserver on output.  This is useful for generating sequences
of file names which are numbered with leading zeros.
.SH EXAMPLE
\fI
.nf
for i in `loop 10 30 5`
do
  echo $i
done
.fi
\fP
Will display the values 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30.
.P
\fI
.nf
for i in `loop 008 005`
do
  echo $i
done
.fi
\fP
Will display the values 008, 007, 006, 005.
.P
\fI
.nf
for i in `loop 0.1 2.9 0.5`
do
  echo $i
done
.fi
\fP
Will display the values 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6, 2.1, 2.6.
.SH BUGS
This program just scratches the surface.
The shells could benefit from a greater ability to perform math.
Limitless opportunities for extensions exist, but
this simple version is adequate for most shell scripts
dealing with sequences of images, etc.
