The relative frequency is displayed on the x axis scaled so that
the maximum is full screen.  The value 0 is at the bottom of the
screen, 255 is at the top.
All three colors will be drawn on each scan line, and all are scaled
by the same factor.
.br
The output is overlayed on whatever is currently on the display.
