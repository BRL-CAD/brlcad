.SH NAME
pl\(hyps \- convert UnixPlot to PostScript file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pl-ps
[-ec] [-s square_output_size] [-w output_width] [-n output_height] < unix_plot
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pl-ps
converts an extended UnixPlot file to a PostScript file
suitable for embedding in a larger PostScript document.
This is especially useful for creating figures for inclusion in TeX
documents.
The
.I -e
option will produce and encapsulated PostScript file. The
.I -s
,
.I -w
, and
.I -n
options specify the size of the output image in inches (ignored when used with the
.I -e
option).
.P
All UnixPlot line types are supported.
.P
If no UnixPlot
.B space
directive is seen, the default space ranges from
(0, 0, 0) to (4096, 4096, 4096).
