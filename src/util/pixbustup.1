.SH NAME
pixbustup \- break up concatenated pix images into seperate files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pixbustup
basename width
[image_offset]
[first_number]
\<\ input.pix
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pixbustup
takes input consisting of a concatenated collection of
.IR pix (5)
format files
and breaks them up into seperate files.  The output file names will be
of the form
.IR basename.num ,
where
.I basename
is given on the command line, and
.I num
is a consecutive series of integers.  By default the first image
will be made number `` 0 '', but an alternate
.I first_number
can be given.
The images must be square and the width (and height) is given by
.IR width .
The program keeps reading these small files until end of file
is reached.
If one does not wish to extract from the beginning of the input file an
.I image_offset
can be given which will skip that number of images before beginning.
.PP
This program is mostly a holdover from the days when
.IR rt (1)
wrote animations into
one huge file, but it is still sometimes useful.
