.SH NAME
pixhist3d\(hypl \- output RGB color space utilization in 3D unix-plot
form
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pixhist3d-pl
[file.pix] | plot
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pixhist3d-pl
takes a color
.IR pix (5)
format file
and outputs points for each RGB color occuring in the image.
The format of these points is the BRL extended three dimensional UNIX
plot (see
.IR libplot3 (3)).
A red, green, and blue line is drawn along the edges of the
color space indicating the coordinate axis.  The resolution of the
color space is 128x128x128, i.e. the least significant bit of each
color plane is ignored.
.PP
These plots are best viewed on an interactive 3D UNIX plot display
program, so that the color cube can be viewed from all angles.
Anomalies in the colors of an image can often be seen, e.g.
oversaturation resulting in intensity clipping.
