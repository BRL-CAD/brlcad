.SH NAME
pix-ppm	\- convert a BRL-CAD PIX or BW format image to a PPM format image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pix-ppm
.RB [ \-a ]
.RB [ \-s squaresize ]
.RB [ \-w file_width ]
.RB [ \-n file_height ]
.RB [ \-# bytes_per_pixel ]
.RB [ \-o PPM_file ]
 [PIX_file]
.RB [ > PPM_file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pix-ppm
converts a
.I BRL PIX(5)
format file to a
.I PPM
(Portable PixMap) format file on the standard output. The PPM file
created will be either an RGB file with 3 bytes per pixel (default) or
a B&W file with 1 byte per pixel
.LP
PIX image files do not contain information about their size.  The size
of the input PIX image file must be specified if the dimensions are
not the default 512x512 size.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
autosize the input file to determine file image height and width
.TP
.B \-s squaresize
sets both the width and the height for the input to be
.I squaresize
.TP
.B \-w file_width
tells
.I pix-ppm
that the input is
.I file_width
pixels wide
.TP
.B \-n file_height
tells
.I pix-ppm
that the input is
.I file_height
scanlines tall
.TP
.B \-# bytes_per_pixel
tells
.I pix-ppm
how many bytes there are per pixel in the input PIX or BW file.
.TP
.B \-o PPM_file
tells
.I pix-ppm
to write image data to the specified
.I PPM_file
output file.  The
.I pix-ppm
command will not write out binary image data directly to a terminal
device as a safeguard.
