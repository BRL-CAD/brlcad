.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pixhalve
.RB [ \-a ]
.RB [ \-s\  squareinsize]
.RB [ \-w\  in_width]
.RB [ \-n\  in_height]
.RB [ \-h ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pixhalve
will take a color
.IR pix (5)
format file of given dimensions and reduce the resolution of the file
by one half in each direction using a 5x5 pyramid filter.  If a file name
is not given, standard input will be used.
The
.I \-w
and
.I \-n
flags specify the input file width and number of scan lines in pixels.
They can both be set to the same value via
.I \-s.
Defaults of 512 are assumed for unspecified dimensions.
.PP
The
.B \-h
flag indicates the input file is
high resolution (1024x1024).
