.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pixfilter
applies one of several 3x3 kernel filters to a color
.IR pix (5)
format file.
It will take a file name or else read from standard input.
The input file size will be assumed to be 512 by 512 pixels
unless the
.BR \-w ,
and/or
.BR \-n ,
or the
.B \-s
flags are used to tell it otherwise.
By default a low pass filter is used.  The
.BI \-f\  type
flag can be used to specify a different type of filter.
.PP
The
.I type
choices include:
.TP
.B lo
low pass, the default.
.TP
.B hi
high pass
.TP
.B vg
vertical gradient
.TP
.B hg
horizontal gradient
.TP
.B la
laplacian
.TP
.B b
boxcar low pass
.PP
Most filters divide the result of the kernel mutiplication
by some value in order to scale it back to a 0->255 range.
For example, the boxcar divides by nine.  The
.B -d
flag can be used to change this divisor.
Some filters also add an offset to their results.  The output of
a laplacian for example is "centered" about zero, thus it
adds 128 to the answer to yield a difference from neutral grey.
The
.B \-o
flag can be used to change this offset.
.PP
The
.B \-v
flag displays the kernel values on standard error.

.SH BUGS
This should allow any 3x3 kernel to be specified.
