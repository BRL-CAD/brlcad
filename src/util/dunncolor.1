.SH NAME
dunncolor \- set exposure values for a Dunn Model 631 camera
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dunncolor
.RB [ \-p ]
baseval redval greenval blueval
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dunncolor
sets the exposure values in the Dunn Instruments Model 631 camera
to the specified values.
If the
.I -p
flag is used, the Polaroid (8X10) exposure values are set.
Otherwise, the auxiliary camera exposure values are set.
.I baseval,
.I redval,
.I greenval,
and
.I blueval,
are values between 0 and 255 used to calculate the exposure times for
the red, green, and blue filters. The final value for each color is the
product of
.I baseval
and the value for that color
.RI ( redval ,
.I greenval,
or
.IR blueval ).
Exposure timing is based on the counting of vertical SYNC pulses.
The final exposure value indicates the number of SYNC pulses for
which the camera's monitor should be unblanked. At a 60 Hz rate,
this means an exposure time of 1 second for every 60 SYNC pulses.
.I Dunncolor
reads the old values from the camera and prints them before setting the new values.
The new values are then read from the camera and printed to verify that they have
been changed. The five values printed are the exposure values for base, red,
green, blue and black/white.
