.SH NAME
pix-ps \- convert a color pix file to PostScript
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pix-ps
.RB [ \-e ]\ [ -c ]
.RB [ \-L ]\ [ -h ]
.RB [ \-s\  input_squaresize]
.RB [ \-w\  input_width]
.RB [ \-n\  input_height]
.RB [ \-S\  inches_square]
.RB [ \-W\  inches_width]
.RB [ \-N\  inches_height]
[infile.pix] \>\ outfile.ps
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pix-ps
will take a color
.IR pix (5)
format file of given dimensions and produce a Postscript file
on the standard output.
The
.I \-w
and
.I \-n
flags specify the input file width and number of scan lines in pixels.
They can both be set to the same value via
.I \-s.
The
.I \-h
flag is a shorthand for an input image size of 1024 square.
If no input size is given, defaults of 512 are assumed.
.PP
By default the output PostScript image size is 6.75 inches.
The
.I \-c
option will center it on a 8.5 x 11 inch page.
If a different output size is desired,
.I \-S
.I \-W
and
.I \-N
can be used to set the size in inches analagous to the input
parameters.
Finally,
.I \-L
selects landscape mode, i.e. rotates the output image by ninety degrees.
.PP
Encapsulated PostScript files can be generated via
.I \-e.
.SH EXAMPLES
pix-ps -c image.pix > image.ps
.sp
Produces a 6.75 inch PostScript file from an 512x512 input image
and centers it on an 8.5 x 11 inch page.
.PP
.sp
pix-ps -e -w 1024 -n 768 image.pix > image.ps
.sp
Takes the file image.pix which has the dimensions of 1024 pixels wide
by 768 pixel high, and produces an Encapsulated Postscript version
of it.
.PP
.sp
pix-ps -L -c -W 5.2 < image.pix > image.ps
.sp
Makes a PostScript file of the (assumed 512 square) image, with
the output image 5.2 inches square, in landscape mode, centered
on an 8.5 x 11 inch page.
