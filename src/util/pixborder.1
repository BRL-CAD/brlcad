.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pixborder
reads an input stream of
.I pix
data,
looking for maximal contiguous regions of
a specified interior color,
and writes out the
.I pix
data
with all pixels on the boundaries of these regions changed to
a specified border color.

The way
.I pixborder
decides if a given pixel is on the boundary
depends on how the user specified the interior and exterior.
The
.B -i
option causes
.I pixborder
to replace
the default interior color of 255 255 255 by
.IR "R G B" ,
while the
.B -I
replaces it by
.IR "H S V" ,
which are reals,
with
\fIH\fR in [0,\ 360)
and
\fIS\fR, \fIV\fR in [0,\ 1].
Similarly,
the
.BR -e " and " -E
options
replace the default exterior color of 1 1 1.
If the user specified colors for both or neither
of the interior and exterior,
then a pixel is on the boundary provided that
it has the interior color
and at least one of its four neighbors
(left, right, above, and below) has the exterior color.
If,
on the other hand,
the user specifed only the interior (exterior) color,
then a pixel is on the boundary provided that
it has the interior color (does not have the exterior color)
and at least one of its neighbors
does not have the interior color (has the exterior color).

Variability in the interior and exterior colors
may be accomodated by the
.BR -t " and " -T
options,
with which one specifies a symmetric tolerance
for each of the red, green, and blue channels
or hue, saturation, and value.
Any color
within the specified tolerance of the nominal interior (exterior) color
is treated as though it were the nominal color.

Changes are restricted to a specified rectangular portion of the image,
which defaults to the entire image.
The
.B -x
option sets the left edge of that rectangle:
no pixels to the left of this edge are changed.
The
.BR -X ", " y ",  and " Y
options respectively
set the right, bottom, and top edges
in the same manner.

.SH HINT
To obtain borders more than one pixel wide,
one can run several copies of
.I pixborder
in a pipeline.
In doing this
to get, for instance, a border made up of constant-thickness
segments of different colors,
one should produce all the segments of a given layer
before beginning any segments of the next inner layer.
