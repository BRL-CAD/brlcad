.SH NAME
bary \- compute weighted sums of points
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "bary  [ -nt ] [ -s " "'x y z'" " ] [ " "file" " ] "
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Bary
computes weighted sums of a set of sites in Euclidean 3-space,
writing them on the standard output.
The site weights are read from
.I file
if it is specified;
otherwise,
.I bary
reads from the standard input.
A line of input must be either
(1) entirely white space,
(2) white space followed by a comment (begun with the '#' character),
or (3) white-space-separated weights, one per site.

By default,
.I bary
uses the three sites (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1).
One or more occurences of the
.B -s
option cause
.I bary
to replace
the default sites with all the sites
(\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, \fIz\fR)
.\".RI "(" "x" ", " "y" ", " "z" ")" " " "huh?"
so specified.

The
.B -n
option causes
.I bary
to normalize each tuple of weights to sum to one.
This has the effect of computing
barycentric combinations of the sites.

If any line of weights in the input stream
contains more fields than the number of sites,
.I bary
will, by default,
ignore the excess fields.
The
.B -t
option causes
.I bary
to copy all such trailing fields verbatim onto the tail of
the corresponding line of output.

.SH EXAMPLE
The command

.nf
.in +4
bary -tn -s '0 0 0' -s '1 0 0' -s '0.5 0.866 0' <<EOF
#------------------------------
# x   y   z     aux. data

 0.0 1.0 2.0    37 bravo
13.0 9.2 6.3    69 charlie delta
EOF
.in -4
.fi

maps the triples to points in an equilateral triangle in the \fIxy\fR-plane,
producing the following output:

.nf
