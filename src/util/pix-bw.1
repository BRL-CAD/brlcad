.SH NAME
pix\(hybw \- combine pix color planes into a bw black and white image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pix-bw
.RB [ \-ntsc ]
.RB [ \-crt ]
.RB [ \-R [num]]
.RB [ \-G [num]]
.RB [ \-B [num]]
[in.pix]
\>\ out.bw
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pix-bw
will combine or select the color planes of a
.IR pix (5)
format
file from it's standard input
and produce a black and white
.IR bw (5)
file on it's standard output.
By default all three colors are weighted equally.  The
.B \-ntsc
uses weighting based on the NTSC primaries and the D6500
alignment white.  The
.B \-crt
flag applies weights for "typical" CRT phosphor chromaticities
and the D6500 white.
.PP
Individual color plane(s) can be selected via the
.B \-R\ \-G
and
.B \-B
flags.
If one or more of these flags is followed by a value,
the value will be treated as a weight
to be applied to that color
This value is implicitly 1.0 divided by
the number of colors selected for the flags which are not followed
by a value.
.SH EXAMPLES
.I pix-bw\ \-R\ \-B\ \<\ file.pix\ \>\ file.bw
.br
will equally blend the red and blue color planes.
.PP
.I pix-bw\ \-R0.30\ \-G0.59\ \-B0.11\ \<\ file.pix\ \>\ file.bw
.br
has the same effect as the
.B \-ntsc
flag.
.br
[The
.B \-crt
weights are: 0.26, 0.66, 0.08]
