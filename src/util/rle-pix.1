.SH NAME
rle\(hypix \- convert Utah Raster Toolkit run-length encoded image to RGB pixel format
.SH SYNOPSIS

.RB [ \-s\  squareoutsize]
.RB [ \-w\  out_width]
.RB [ \-n\  out_height]

.RB [ \-N\  out_height]
[file.rle [file.pix]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I rle-fb\^
decodes a Utah Raster Toolkit
Run-Length Encoded (RLE) format file
(saved with
.IR fb-rle\^ (1),
.IR pix-rle (1),
or a similar program),
converts it into
.IR pix\^ (5)
format, and writes it to standard out.
If
.I file.rle\^
is not specified, standard input is read.
.I rle-pix\^
determines the type and size of the saved file (color or B&W)
and acts accordingly.
.TP
.B \-c
is the colormap \fIcrunch\fR flag.
If the crunch flag has been specified and
a non-linear colormap is stored in the RLE file,
then the colormap is applied to the pixels as they are output.
Otherwise, the encoded pixel values are output without being affected by
any color map stored in the RLE file.
.TP
.B \-d
Debug option, provides a description of the parameters of the
saved RLE image on standard error.
.TP
.BI \-C r/g/b\^
The background of the image is
normally set to the value recorded in the RLE file.
This option permits
the user to specify an alternate background color
as slash separated decimal numbers in the range of 0 to 255,
one each for the red, green, and blue channels.
.TP
.I file.rle\^
Name of file to decode, in RLE format.
.TP
.I file.pix\^
Optional name of file to store PIX image in.
