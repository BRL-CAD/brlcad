/** @file pixsaturate.c
 *
 *  A saturation value of 0 gives monochrome,
 *  1.0 gives the original image,
 *  and values larger than 1.0 give a more saturated image.
 *
 *  Author -
 *	Michael John Muuss
 *	(based on a subroutine by Paul Haeberli)
 *
 *  Remarks from Haeberli's routine:
 *	saturate-
 *		Change the saturation of a row of pixels.  If sat is
 *	set to 0.0 the result will be monochromatic, if sat is made
 *	1.0, the color will not change, if sat is made greater than 1.0,
 *	the amount of color is increased.
 *
 *	The input and output pixel values are in the range 0..255.
 *
 *	This technique requires 6 multiplies, 5 adds and 3 bound
 *	checks per pixel.
 *
 *			Paul Haeberli - 1988
