.SH NAME
bwhisteq \- equalize the histogram of a black and white bw file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bwhisteq
.RB [ \-v ]
file.bw > file.equalized
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Bwhisteq
automatically equalizes the histogram of a black and white
.IR bw (5)
format file.
It reads the file
.I file.bw
and writes a "remapped" version of it on its standard output.
The method used is to distribute the values of the histogram, as
best as possible, in order to
produce a constant average "density",
while maintaining monotonicity.
.PP
The
.B \-v
flag will output the old and new histogram values on the terminal.
