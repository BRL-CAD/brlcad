.SH NAME
pix-png	\- convert a BRL-CAD PIX format image to a PNG format image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pix-png
.RB [ \-a ]
.RB [ \-g gamma ]
.RB [ \-s squaresize ]
.RB [ \-w file_width ]
.RB [ \-n file_height ]
.RB [ \-o PNG_file ]
 [PIX_file]
.RB [ > PNG_file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pix-png
converts a
.I BRL PIX(5)
format file to a
.I PNG
(Portable Network Graphics) format file on the standard output. The
PNG file created will be an RGB file with a bit-depth of 8 and a file
gamma of 1.0.
.LP
PIX image files do not contain information about their size.  The size
of the input PIX image file must be specified if the dimensions are
not the default 512x512 size.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
autosize the input file to determine file image height and width
.TP
.B \-g gamma
sets the specified gamma correction value into the created PNG file.
A value of 0.6 is a close approximation of PC display monitors.  A
negative gamma value disables writing a gAMA chunk out entirely (and
is the default).
.TP
.B \-s squaresize
sets both the width and the height for the input to be
.I squaresize
.TP
.B \-w file_width
tells
.I pix-png
that the input is
.I file_width
pixels wide
.TP
.B \-n file_height
tells
.I pix-png
that the input is
.I file_height
scanlines tall
.TP
.B \-o PNG_file
tells
.I pix-png
to write image data to the specified
.I PNG_file
output file.  The
.I pix-png
command will not write out binary image data directly to a terminal
device as a safeguard.

.SH "BUG REPORTS"
Reports of bugs or problems should be submitted via electronic
mail to <devs@brlcad.org>.
