.SH NAME
dbcp \- double buffered copy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dbcp
.RB [ \-v ]
\fIblocksize\fR
< infile > outfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dbcp
is a program for copying data rapidly between devices.
While the primary application is to move data between raw devices such as
tape and disk, it can also be used with pipes.
No special support is required from the operating system;
.I dbcp
forks into two processes which communicate over a pair of regular pipes
using a token passing scheme to
synchronize their reading and writing activities.  They continue
copying until an end of file or error is detected.
.I dbcp
reads from the standard input and copies to the standard output.
The argument
.I blocksize
specifies the number of 512 byte "blocks" to be
read or written in each record.
.PP
If the
.B \-v
flag is given,
the number of records processed is printed upon exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
$ \fBdbcp 16 < /dev/rdk1a > /dev/rmt0\fR
.br
.I dbcp
copies the filesystem on dk1a to tape
with a record size of 8K bytes (16 * 512).
This allows ``streaming'' tape drives to operate a peak speed.
.PP
$ \fBtar cf - . | dbcp 20 > /dev/rmt0\fR
.br
The
.I tar
process runs independently of the
.IR dbcp ,
which rapidly copies the data to tape
with the usual
.I tar
tape record size of 10K bytes (20 * 512).
