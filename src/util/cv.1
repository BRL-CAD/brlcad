.SH NAME
cv \- convert binary data files between representation formats
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cv
in_pat out_pat [[infile] outfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Convert a binary data file from one representation (format) to another.
The particular representation desired is expressed as a set of choices
from the pattern: [h|n][s|u] c|s|i|l|d|8|16|32|64.
For example, "hui" is host unsigned int, "nl" is network (signed) long.
The default is NETWORK format.
.P
Host specific format is the native internal number representation used
inside the computer that
.B cv
is running on.
There is great variation between vendors in the host-specific formats
that they use.
Especially for double-precision floating point,
DEC, Cray, and IBM have peculiar formats and byte orderings.
The network-independent byte orderings used within BRL-CAD is
big-endian (most significant bit first, on the left side of the word),
twos compliment.
The network-independent double-precision floating point format used
within BRL-CAD is 64-bit IEEE 754, transmitted in big-endian order.
.P
Signed or unsigned integer formats can be selected.
This has no effect on the double-precision format.
.P
"char", "short", "int", "long", and "double" provide their C language
equivalent on this processor when used in "h" host-specific mode.
"8", "16", "32", and "64" allow more precise specification of
datum sizes for "n" network-independent mode.
.P
For example, to change a file of host-specific (machine-specific) signed
shorts to a file of network-independent 32-bit integers, the input
format would be "hss", and the output format would be "n32".
