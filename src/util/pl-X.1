.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pl-X
.RB [ \-v ]
< unix_plot

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pl-X
displays an extended UnixPlot file on any workstation running the
X Window System (X11R2).  As with all X programs, the selected
display is determined from the

environment variable.

The
.B \-v
verbose option causes descriptions of the plot commands to be
printed.

of this writing.  It needs the ability to rotate, translate, zoom, etc.
