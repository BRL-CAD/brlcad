.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I wavelet
command
will perform Haar wavelet decomposition or reconstruction
transforms
on the input dataset.
The command line options are:

.BI \-d
perform decomposition.

.BI \-r
perform reconstruction.

.br
.BI \-1
perform a 1-dimensional (horizontal) transform.

.BI \-2
perform a 1-dimensional (interleaved horizontal and vertical) transform.

.BI \-#\ channels
Indicates the number of values in each sample point.  For example, to perform
a transform on a
.IR pix (5)
file properly, specify ``-# 3''.  This causes the red, green and blue channels
to be transformed individually.

.BI \-t\ {cdfils}
specifies the data type of the input, and hence the data type in which the
wavelet calculations will be performed.
The letters each stand for the first
character of the C programming language data type:
\fBc\fRharacter,
\fBd\fRouble,
\fBf\fRloat,
\fBi\fRnt,
\fBl\fRong,
\fBs\fRhort.
Note that if lossless decomposition
and reconstruction are desired, then data sets should be converted to the next
larger data type before being processed.


.BI \-w\ width
Specifiy the number of samples per scanline.

.BI \-n\ scanline
Specify the number of scanlines in the dataset

.BI \-s\ squaresize
Specify both width and scanlines simultaneously (square image).

.BI \-W\ width_out
Specifies the width of the output image.  Normally this is 1 for a full
decomposition/reconstruction.  You may specify a width at which decomposition or reconstruction
should stop. This number should be a power of 2.  The result will be an
``average'' image of the specified size, with the remainder of the original
data width converted to ``detail'' coefficients.  See also: -R

.BI \-R\ avg_size
Resumes a transform that left off with an average image of avg_size.


.BI \-S\ square_out_size
This is the same as the
.B \-W
option.  It implies the square size for a 2D decomposition limit.


.SH EXAMPLES


The command
.br
.I decompose -# 3 < img.pix | pix-fb
.br
will display the horizontal decomposition of the file img.pix.

The command
.br
.I decompose -# 3 -s 1024 -l 64 < img.pix >
.br
will decompose a 1024x1024 image.  The decomposition will stop when the
image has been decomposed to 64x64.  The output image will thus have a 64x64
version of the original in the lower left corner of the image, with detail
terms in the remainder.
