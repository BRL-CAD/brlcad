Mk_bolt is a program to create an mged data base of one of four
different kinds of bolts.  Up to twenty-six bolts of one type
and size may
be created.  Mk_bolt uses libwdb to create an mged data base.  This
program may be run interactively or the user may specify options on
a command line.  If the user chooses to run the program interactively
he answers the questions as the program prompts him.  Below are the
options that can be used on the command line.
