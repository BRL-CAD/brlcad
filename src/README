Contained in this directory are the sources to BRL-CAD.  This
presently includes over 400+ tools and more than two dozen libraries
across more than a million lines of source code.  The contents of the
individual directories are briefly described below.
	It is part of BRL-CAD's intentional build infrastructure
design consideration to not require the installation of minor 3rd
party external codes in order for the package to compile or operate
correctly.  As part of this philosophy, the majority of BRL-CAD's
required and optional dependencies are preconfigured and bundled with
the package in the "other" directory.  For those components of BRL-CAD
that have library dependencies that are not easily bundled in a
cross-platform sustainable manner, such as linkages to commercial
libraries, said components are included in the "external" directory.
