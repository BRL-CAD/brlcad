.SH NAME
patch\(hyg \- convert FASTGEN ASCII databases into binary MGED databases.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program converts FASTGEN geometry into BRL-CAD 
.IR mged (1)
formats. FASTGEN is
a modeling system used by the Air Force and Navy to create military target 
descriptions. FASTGEN databases consist of the following primitives which
can be converted by 
.IR patch-g
: polygons, plates, boxes, wedges, cylinders, spheres, and rods.
.PP
.IR patch-g 
requires that the FASTGEN file be run through the pre-processor 
.IR rpatch.
This is achieved by executing 
.IR rpatch < fastgen_file > file.rpatch .
Once this step is executed, 
.IR patch-g 
can be used to convert the intermediate file into binary
.IR mged (1)
file.
.PP
.IR patch-g 
will provide messages when encountering problems in the conversion of FASTGEN
geometry. For further debugging information, the -d flag with levels 1-3 of
debugging can be provided. 
.SH EXAMPLE
.I
rpatch < fastgen_file > file.rpatch

.I
patch-g -f file.rpatch > file.g
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics are intended to be self-explanatory.
