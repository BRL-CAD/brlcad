	The Pro/Engineer to BRL-CAD conversion is a two step process.
First, in Pro/Engineer, you must select "Interface", then "Export",
then "BRL-CAD" under the part or assembly menu. The "current object"
will be output to a file in an ascii format.  The default file name will be
the name of the current object with a ".brl" suffix (note that the
Pro/Develop software makes the name of the current object all capital
letters). You may provide your own file name, and you may provide a
"quality" (1 to 10) that will determine the coarseness of the facetization.
The lower the "quality", the coarser the facets. The second step is to use
"proe-g" to convert the ".brl" file to a ".g" file (see "man proe-g").

	To inform Pro/Engineer about the Pro/Develop code that produces
the ".brl" file, you need to create a "prodev.dat" file as follows:

line 1:NAME = proe-brl
line 2:EXEC_PATH = 'full path to wherever you install the proe-brl executable'
line 3:TEXT_PATH = 'full path to wherever you install the "text" directory'
line 4:END

	See "prodev.dat" in this directory for an example. The EXEC_PATH must
inlcude the name of the executable file, but the TEXT_PATH must not include
the name of the "text" directory. Pro/Engineer will look in the "TEXT_PATH"
directory for a subdirectory named "text". In the "text" directory it will
look for subdirectories named "menus" and "fullhelp" and for a file named
"usermsg.txt". The "text" directory in this directory should be used or at
least copied verbatim to where you want to use it.

	The "prodev.dat" file must be located where Pro/Engineer will look for it.
Pro/Engineer will look in your current directory and in Pro/Engineer's "text"
directory (as well as a few other places).  For example, I have "prodev.dat"
in "/usr/proe/sgi/text/usascii" for an "sgi" machine.

	If the "prodev.dat" file and the "proe-brl" executable are installed
properly, you will see a message "BRL-CAD Export option added to Pro/E version
XX.X, build YYWW" in the Pro/Engineer message window.
