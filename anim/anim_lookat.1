.TH ANIM_LOOKAT 1 BRL/CAD
.SH NAME
anim_lookat - create a view animation script or table which looks from an eye point to 
a specified point.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B anim_lookat 
.B [\-f #]
.B < in.table 
.B > out.script
.PP
.B anim_lookat 
.B \-[y|q] 
.B < in.table 
.B > out.table

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program takes as input a seven-column animation table
consisting of time, an eye point, and a "look-at point", and prints a
view animation script to control the virtual camera. 
The camera always remains "right-side up"; that is, it yaws and pitches but 
doesn't roll. In cases where the camera looks vertically up or down, the 
yaw from the previous frame is retained. This avoids sudden jumps as much
as possible.
.PP
The 
.B \-f#
option is used to specify an integer with which to begin
numbering frames. The default is 0.
.PP
The
.B \-y
option specifies that the output should be an animation table rather
than an animation script. The output table has 7 columns: a time column, three
columns representing position, and three columns representing yaw,
pitch, and roll.
.PP
The
.B \-q
option specifies that the output should be an eight-column animation table
consisting of a time column, three position columns, and four columns 
representing the x,y,z, and w coordinates of an orientation quaternion.
