.TH ANIM_TIME 1 BRL/CAD
.SH NAME
anim_time - estimate appropriate time parameters for path
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B anim_time
.B [-s start_speed]
.B [-e end_speed]
.B [-m max_len] 
.B [-v|q]
.B < in.table 
.B > out.table
.SH DESCRIPTION
This filter is designed to estimate appropriate time parameters for
an animation curve in 3D space. Given a four-column table specifying
time and 3D position for an object, 
.I anim_time 
ignores all but the first and last time specifications and
calculates reasonable time values for each intermediate point in the table. 
The
output time values are based on the distances between points and the
calculated speed of the object. Various options allow the user to
control the assumptions on the object's initial and final speeds, and the
form of the output.

.I Anim_time
is intended to be used in situations where the user knows what key points
an object should pass through and how long the entire motion should take, 
but doesn't care exactly when the object
reaches each point. It is also useful for getting objects to accelerate
smoothly to and from rest.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -m #
Specify the maximum number of points to be read. This default to 64, so
you must use this option if you want to use tables with more than 64
points.
.TP
.BR -s #
Specify the starting speed of the object. If this option is not
specified, then the object is assumed to be initially travelling on a
pace to negotiate the entire path in the given time at a constant rate.
.TP
.BR -e #
Specify the final speed of the object. If this option is not specified,
then the object is assumed to end up travelling on a pace to negotiate
the entire path in the given time at a constant rate.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose option. The output table will contain a time column and three
position columns. If this option is not specified, only the new time
column will be printed.
.TP
.B -q
Query the total distance. If this option is specified, the only output
will be a number representing the total length of the input path.
