.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_Init\fR is the package initialization procedure for Tk.
It is normally invoked by the \fBTcl_AppInit\fR procedure
for an application or by the \fBload\fR command.
\fBTk_Init\fR adds all of Tk's commands to \fIinterp\fR
and creates a new Tk application, including its main window.
If the initialization is successful \fBTk_Init\fR returns
\fBTCL_OK\fR;  if there is an error it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR.
\fBTk_Init\fR also leaves a result or error message
in \fIinterp->result\fR.
.PP
If there is a variable \fBargv\fR in \fIinterp\fR, \fBTk_Init\fR
treats the contents of this variable as a list of options for the
new Tk application.
The options may have any of the forms documented for the
\fBwish\fR application (in fact, \fBwish\fR uses Tk_Init to process
its command-line arguments).

.SH KEYWORDS
application, initialization, load, main window
