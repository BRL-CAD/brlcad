.SH NAME
tk \- Manipulate Tk internal state
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtk\fR \fIoption \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBtk\fR command provides access to miscellaneous
elements of Tk's internal state.
Most of the information manipulated by this command pertains to the
application as a whole, or to a screen or display, rather than to a
particular window.
The command can take any of a number of different forms
depending on the \fIoption\fR argument.  The legal forms are:
.TP
\fBtk appname \fR?\fInewName\fR?
If \fInewName\fR isn't specified, this command returns the name
of the application (the name that may be used in \fBsend\fR
commands to communicate with the application).
If \fInewName\fR is specified, then the name of the application
is changed to \fInewName\fR.
If the given name is already in use, then a suffix of the form
``\fB #2\fR'' or ``\fB #3\fR'' is appended in order to make the name unique.
The command's result is the name actually chosen.
\fInewName\fR should not start with a capital letter.
This will interfere with option processing, since names starting with
capitals are assumed to be classes;  as a result, Tk may not
be able to find some options for the application.
If sends have been disabled by deleting the \fBsend\fR command,
this command will reenable them and recreate the \fBsend\fR
command.

.TP
\fBtk scaling \fR?\fB\-displayof \fIwindow\fR? ?\fInumber\fR?
.
Sets and queries the current scaling factor used by Tk to convert between
physical units (for example, points, inches, or millimeters) and pixels.  The
\fInumber\fR argument is a floating point number that specifies the number of
pixels per point on \fIwindow\fR's display.  If the \fIwindow\fR argument is
omitted, it defaults to the main window.  If the \fInumber\fR argument is 
omitted, the current value of the scaling factor is returned.
.RS
.PP
A ``point'' is a unit of measurement equal to 1/72 inch.  A scaling factor
of 1.0 corresponds to 1 pixel per point, which is equivalent to a standard
72 dpi monitor.  A scaling factor of 1.25 would mean 1.25 pixels per point,
which is the setting for a 90 dpi monitor; setting the scaling factor to
1.25 on a 72 dpi monitor would cause everything in the application to be
displayed 1.25 times as large as normal.  The initial value for the scaling
factor is set when the application starts, based on properties of the
installed monitor, but it can be changed at any time.  Measurements made
after the scaling factor is changed will use the new scaling factor, but it
is undefined whether existing widgets will resize themselves dynamically to
accomodate the new scaling factor.
