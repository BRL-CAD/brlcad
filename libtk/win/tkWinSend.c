 *
 * Tk_SetAppName --
 *
 *	This procedure is called to associate an ASCII name with a Tk
 *	application.  If the application has already been named, the
 *	name replaces the old one.
 *
 * Results:
 *	The return value is the name actually given to the application.
 *	This will normally be the same as name, but if name was already
 *	in use for an application then a name of the form "name #2" will
 *	be chosen,  with a high enough number to make the name unique.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	Registration info is saved, thereby allowing the "send" command
 *	to be used later to invoke commands in the application.  In
 *	addition, the "send" command is created in the application's
 *	interpreter.  The registration will be removed automatically
 *	if the interpreter is deleted or the "send" command is removed.

 * Results:

 *	to hold a list of all the interpreter names defined for
 *	tkwin's display.  If an error occurs, then TCL_ERROR
 *	is returned and interp->result will hold an error message.

 * Side effects:
