 *	applications to crash when X resource identifiers wrap around.
 *	The replacement functions in this file re-use old identifiers
 *	to prevent this problem.
 *
 *	The code in this file is based on similar implementations by
 *	George C. Kaplan and Michael Hoegeman.

 * TkFreeWindowId --
 *
 *	This procedure is invoked instead of TkFreeXId for window ids.
 *	See below for the reason why.
 *
 * Results:
 *	None.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	The id given by w will eventually be freed, so that it can be
 *	reused for other resources.
 *
 * Design:
 *	Freeing window ids is very tricky because there could still be
 *	events pending for a window in the event queue (or even in the
 *	server) at the time the window is destroyed.  If the window
 *	id were to get reused immediately for another window, old
 *	events could "drop in" on the new window, causing unexpected
 *	behavior.
 *
 *	Thus we have to wait to re-use a window id until we know that
 *	there are no events left for it.  Right now this is done in
 *	two steps.  First, we wait until we know that the server
 *	has seen the XDestroyWindow request, so we can be sure that
 *	it won't generate more events for the window and that any
 *	existing events are in our queue.  Second, we make sure that
 *	there are no events whatsoever in our queue (this is conservative
 *	but safe).
 *
 * 	The first step is done by remembering the request id of the
 *	XDestroyWindow request and using LastKnownRequestProcessed to
 *	see what events the server has processed.  If multiple windows
 *	get destroyed at about the same time, we just remember the
 *	most recent request number for any of them (again, conservative
 *	but safe).
 *
 *	There are a few other complications as well.  When Tk destroys a
 *	sub-tree of windows, it only issues a single XDestroyWindow call,
 *	at the very end for the root of the subtree.  We can't free any of
 *	the window ids until the final XDestroyWindow call.  To make sure
 *	that this happens, we have to keep track of deletions in progress,
 *	hence the need for the "destroyCount" field of the display.
 *
 *	One final problem.  Some servers, like Sun X11/News servers still
 *	seem to have problems with ids getting reused too quickly.  I'm
 *	not completely sure why this is a problem, but delaying the
 *	recycling of ids appears to eliminate it.  Therefore, we wait
 *	an additional few seconds, even after "the coast is clear"
 *	before reusing the ids.
