# Drag & Drop Tclets
# by Ray Johnson
#
# A simple way to create Tcl applications.  This applications will copy a droped Tcl file
# into a copy of a stub application (the user can pick).  The file is placed into the
# TEXT resource named "tclshrc" which is automatically executed on startup.

# tkOpenDocument --
#
#	This procedure is a called whenever Wish recieves an "Open" event.  The
#	procedure must be named tkOpenDocument for this to work.  Passed in files
#	are assumed to be Tcl files that the user wants to be made into Tclets.
#	(Only the first one is used.)  The procedure then creates a copy of the
#	stub app and places the Tcl file in the new application's resource fork.
#
# Parameters:
#	args		List of files
#
# Results:
# 	One success a new Tclet is created.
