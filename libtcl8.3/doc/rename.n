.SH NAME
rename \- Rename or delete a command
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrename \fIoldName newName\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Rename the command that used to be called \fIoldName\fR so that it
is now called \fInewName\fR.
If \fInewName\fR is an empty string then \fIoldName\fR is deleted.
\fIoldName\fR and \fInewName\fR may include namespace qualifiers
(names of containing namespaces).
If a command is renamed into a different namespace,
future invocations of it will execute in the new namespace.
The \fBrename\fR command returns an empty string as result.

.SH KEYWORDS
command, delete, namespace, rename
