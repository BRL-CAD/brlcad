Porting Notes
-------------

RCS: @(#) $Id$

Currently, the Macintosh version Tcl only compilies with the
CodeWarrior C compilier from MetroWerks.  It should be straight
forward to port the Tcl source to MPW.

Tcl on the Mac no longer requires the use of GUSI.  It should now
be easier to port Tcl/Tk to other compiliers such as Symantic C
and MPW C.

If you attempt to port Tcl to other Macintosh compiliers please
let me know.  I would be glad to help with advice and encouragement.
If your efforts are succesfull I wold also be interested in puting
those changes into the core distribution.  Furthermore, please feel
free to send me any notes you might make about your porting
experience so I may include them in this file for others to reference.
