Release 8 notes:

Idea:  For every primitive written out to a .g database, include as a standard
component a version id so (for example) we can have multiple different versions
of brep data storage, and have the libg I/O system be able to handle it (or
skip it) cleanly.  db_upgrade would take an older .g and assign version 1 to
all existing primitives writing out the new version.  A downgrade would either
down-convert (if possible) or skip and report when version 1 isn't an option.
This would make .g files backwards incompatible since the on-disk serialization
would change for every object, but with versioning it should (hopefully) be the
last time we would need to do that.

Idea:  Reorder the ad-hoc list of librt primitive ids to be grouped by
mathematical surface order.  Minor, but would make that code a bit cleaner.

Remove the global region_id based material table (rt_material_head and related
code).  There are other ways to achieve this result (search -exec assignment of
colors, for example) and it's not an intuitive mechanism for folks who don't
know where/how to look for it.  db_upgrade can be updated to do the attr color
assignments to produce a .g that doesn't need it, so there will be a clear and
automatic migration path as well.
