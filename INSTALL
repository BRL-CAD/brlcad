To compile and install the BRLCAD source, perform the following steps:

	% mkdir /usr/brlcad

If you choose a directory other than /usr/brlcad, you will need to set the
environment variable BRLCAD_ROOT to be the name of this directory.  Because a
number of paths are compiled into the package, it is not possible to compile
the package for one location, then move it to another.  Be sure that
/usr/brlcad/bin or $BRLCAD_ROOT/bin is in your shell path.  For example:

	sh:
		BRLCAD_ROOT=/foobar/brlcad 
		PATH=$PATH:/foobar/brlcad/bin
		export PATH
	csh:
	 	setenv BRLCAD_ROOT /foobar/brlcad
	 	set path=($path /foobar/brlcad/bin)

Compile:
	% cd /foobar/brlcad
	% sh setup.sh

	The next step can take a considerable amount of time on some systems:
	
	sh:
		make > make.log 2>&1
	csh:
		make >& make.log

Install:
	Review the log of compilation, then run:

		make install

This process should proceed without problems on the following systems:

	RedHat Linux 7.2
	FreeBSD 4.5
	SunOS 5.8 (Solaris)
	Irix 6.5
	Mac OS X (With X11 installed -- INSTALL.pmac for details)
