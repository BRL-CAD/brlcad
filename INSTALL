The Installation Guide to BRL-CAD
=================================

Please read this document if you are interested in installing BRL-CAD.

This document covers the basics of installing BRL-CAD from either a
source or binary distribution.  Please see the 'Reporting Problems'
section if you run into any trouble installing BRL-CAD.

Some platforms have additional platform-specific documentation
provided in the doc/ directory of the source distribution that should
be consulted if that is the platform you are installing on.  This
presently includes the following:

  doc/README.AIX        -- IBM's Advanced Interactive eXecutive OS
  doc/README.BSD        -- FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, etc.
  doc/README.IRIX	-- SGI IRIX and IRIX64
  doc/README.Linux	-- Various Linux distributions
  doc/README.MacOSX	-- Apple Mac OS X
  doc/README.Solaris    -- Oracle Solaris, OpenIndiana (Illumos), etc.
  doc/README.Windows    -- Microsoft Windows
  doc/README.VAX        -- Virtual Address eXtension architecture from DEC.
                           One of the original BRL-CAD platforms. These

QUICK INSTALLATION
------------------

Note that the downloaded files have two check sums calculated
automatically by the Source Forge file release system.  The values are
used to verify the integrity of the files as distributed.  Get those
data by clicking on the 'i' button at the end of each file's name.
You should ensure those data are retained and kept with the files if
you re-distribute them.


If you downloaded a binary distribution of BRL-CAD for your system,
please read the INSTALLING FROM BINARY section of this document down
below.  The rest of this quick installation section is only relevant
to source code distributions of BRL-CAD.

For the impatient or simplistic, the following steps should compile,
test, and install an optimized BRL-CAD quickly into the /usr/brlcad/rel-X.Y.Z
directory if CMake is installed on your system:

  gunzip brlcad-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
  tar -xvf brlcad-X.Y.Z.tar
  mkdir brlcad-build
  cd brlcad-build
  cmake ../brlcad-X.Y.Z -DBRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  make
  make benchmark
  make regress
  make install   # as root, e.g. sudo make install

If any of the listed steps fail, then something unexpected happened.
See the REPORTING PROBLEMS section of this document to report the
problem or the INSTALLING FROM SOURCE section for more comprehensive
instructions.

Once installed, add /usr/brlcad/rel-X.Y.Z/bin to your path, and you should be
able to run any of the 400+ applications that constitute BRL-CAD.  For
example, to run the MGED solid modeler:

PATH=/usr/brlcad/rel-X.Y.Z/bin:$PATH ; export PATH
mged

If you use tcsh or another C-shell based command shell, use this
instead:

set path=( /usr/brlcad/rel-X.Y.Z/bin $path ) ; rehash
mged


INSTALLING FROM BINARY
----------------------

There are a variety of different kinds of binary distributions of
BRL-CAD.  Some of the binary distributions are sufficiently generic and
are simply a binary compressed tarball distribution.  Others are
specific to a particular platform such as Debian, Mac OS X, FreeBSD,
and Windows etc.


Generic Binary Distributions:

For the unspecialized binary distributions that are basically
compressed tarballs of the installation root, they should contain the
entire hierarchy of the distribution.  To put that hierarchy in its
"installed" location, you just create the directory and move the
expanded tarball contents:

gunzip BRL-CAD_7.2.4_Linux_ia64.tar.gz
tar -xvf BRL-CAD_7.2.4_Linux_ia64.tar
sudo mkdir /usr/brlcad/rel-7.2.4
sudo mv BRL-CAD_7.2.4_Linux_ia64/* /usr/brlcad/rel-7.2.4/

Of course, there are other compression options possible including zip
and bzip2.  By default, BRL-CAD expects to be installed into
/usr/brlcad/rel-7.2.4. On some platforms the binary may be relocatable,
but this is not guaranteed. It's recommended that you start from a source
distribution if you would like to install into an alternate installation
location.  That said, if you do desire to install and/or run BRL-CAD from
a different location, give it a try...on some platforms it will work.

Something to be aware of, even if a binary distribution IS relocatable:
it will use its local copies of things like libraries only so long as the
"final" installed target directory that the build was compiled for
does not contain a BRL-CAD installation.  Due to the way path logic
is set, an installed copy of a library in the correct location will
always be loaded first, regardless of the presence of a "local" copy.


Mac OS X Disk Mounting Image:

Mount the .dmg and run the Installer .pkg contained therein.  This
will install into /usr/brlcad/rel-X.Y.Z and will only require confirming that
your environment is set up properly (i.e. add /usr/brlcad/rel-X.Y.Z/bin to your
path) as described in the Quick Installation section.


INSTALLING FROM SOURCE
----------------------

There are a couple of ways to obtain the BRL-CAD sources, usually via
one of the following starting points:

  1) from a SVN checkout/export, or
  2) from a source distribution tarball

Using the latest SVN sources is recommended where possible since it
will have the latest changes.  See the corresponding section below for
details on how to install from either starting point.


Starting From a SVN Checkout/Export:

With CMake, there is no longer any difference between building from
a subversion checkout and a tarball--follow the Source Distribution
instructions below.

Starting From a Source Distribution:

There are many different ways to build BRL-CAD and depending on what
you need/want will determine which configuration options you should
use.  See the CONFIGURATION OPTIONS section below for details on how
to go about selecting which options are appropriate for you.

By default, the default configuration will prepare the build system
to perform a Debug build and install into the /usr/brlcad/dev-X.Y.Z
directory.   The CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option may be used to change
that directory, or a Release build type may be specified to install to
/usr/brlcad/rel-X.Y.Z - more on this below.  The
tradition of non-system installation paths goes back a couple of decades
and is a convenient means to isolate the BRL-CAD solid modeling
system from your system, resolves conflicts, facilitates uninstalls,
and simplifies upgrades.  The default configuration is performed by
running `cmake'.  It is not required to do the build in a directory
different from your source directory, but it is much cleaner and
*highly* recommended - this guide will illustrate the build process
with the assumption that the BRL-CAD source code is in the directory
brlcad-7.2.4 and the directory intended to hold the build output is
brlcad-build, located in the same parent directory as brlcad-7.2.4:

  .
  ./brlcad-7.2.4
  ./brlcad-build

To start the build process, cd into brlcad-build and run CMake,
pointing it to the source directory:

  cd brlcad-build
  cmake ../brlcad-7.2.4

As mentioned earlier, CMake uses two "build types", controlled by
the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE variable, that are useful for specific purposes:

* Debug (-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug) - Debug is the configuration that most
  developers will want to use when working on BRL-CAD.  It will add
  debug flags to the compile, and sets the default install directory to
  be /usr/brlcad/dev-X.Y.Z - in order to run the resulting installed
  binaries, the developer should ensure that the dev-X.Y.Z  path is
  first in his or her PATH environment variable.

* Release (-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release) - A release build is intended for
  final consumption by end users and as such has optimizations enabled.
  It also sets the install path to /usr/brlcad/rel-X.Y.Z - best practice
  for release installation is to set up symbolic links in /usr/brlcad to
  point to the most current BRL-CAD release, while allowing older versions
  to remain installed on the system in case they are needed.

In both of these cases any individual variable may be overridden - for
example, setting -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/brlcad in a Debug build will
override the ../brlcad-install default.  Build types are a convenient way
to bundle sets of settings, but they do not prevent overrides if a more
custom setup is needed.

By default, all components and functionality will be built.
Note that BRL-CAD does require and include several 3rd party
components.  If your system does not include a sufficient version of
those required 3rd party components, they will be automatically
configured for compilation.

If the autodetection mechanisms fail to produce a working configuration,
the next simplest approach is typically to enable ALL the third party
components - this is typically a well tested configuration, but will
increase both the build time and final install size of BRL-CAD on
the system.  To set this variable on the command line, use -D to
define BRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS for CMake:

  -DBRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS=Bundled

If the graphical interface (cmake-gui) is in use, it will list this
and other common options by default, allowing the user change them
graphically.  This is often quicker and more convenient than
defining options on the command line, but both will work.

You can also force on or off any individual 3rd party library by
setting the BRL-CAD variable for that feature to either on or off:

  -DBRLCAD_<LIBRARY>=ON

Other variables control BRL-CAD features.  For example, to NOT
enable functionality using OpenGL, set

  -DBRLCAD_ENABLE_OPENGL=OFF

To obtain an optimized build (for example, for BRL-CAD Benchmark
performance evaluation), enable BRLCAD_FLAGS_OPTIMIZATION:

  -DBRLCAD_FLAGS_OPTIMIZATION=ON

See the CONFIGURATION OPTIONS below for more details on all of the
possible settings.

You can specify options or preferences you want to always use by
default.  For example, to always enable all local libs the following
line can be added to your own configuration file:

  set(BRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS "Bundled" CACHE STRING "Enable all local libs")

You can define your own configuration file in one of three ways.  The
build system will search for the file in this order:

  ${BRLCAD_SOURCE_DIR}/../BRL-CAD_CONFIG.GLOBAL

  ${BRLCAD_SOURCE_DIR}/BRL-CAD_CONFIG.GLOBAL

  the file defined in the environment variable "BRLCAD_USER_GLOBAL_CONFIG_FILE"

The build system will use the first file defined that exists.

Once configured, you should be able to successfully build BRL-CAD via
make:

  make

(On multicore systems, adding the -j flag (e.g. -j6) is recommended)

Installing the Compilation:

After the build successfully completes and assuming the benchmark also
produces correct results, installation may begin.  Like any package,
you must have sufficient filesystem permissions to install.  To
install into a system location, you can generally either become a
super user via the su command and run

  make install

or on operating systems set up to use sudo:

  sudo make install


TESTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------

To test BRL-CAD before installation, you can run the BRL-CAD benchmark.
The benchmark will report if the results are correct, testing a
majority of the core functionality of BRL-CAD in addition to testing
your system's performance:

  make benchmark

Note that the benchmark target will build ONLY the pieces required for
the benchmark tests, unless a general make has already been performed.
For more testing, you can run the regression test suite:

  make regress


POST-INSTALLATION
-----------------

Permissions:

Something to be aware of with CMake installations is that umask settings
are ignored by current versions of CMake.  It is a common situation in
Unix environments to want "group" members to have read/write access -
to achieve this, after installation the following find command can be
run (of course, substituting the actual BRL-CAD version for X.Y.Z):

find /usr/brlcad/rel-X.Y.Z -type d -exec chmod ug+rwx {} \; -exec chmod o+rx {} \; -o -type f -exec chmod ug+rw {} \; -exec chmod o+r {} \;

The above 'find' line will set up permissions across a /usr/brlcad
rooted installation such that 'user' and 'group' will have read-write
access and 'other' will have read access consistently across all
files.


System PATH:

Normally, BRL-CAD's install directories are not in system PATH lists and
consequently BRL-CAD's executables will not be invokable without specifying
their full path.  This is normally handled in Unix environments by adding
the desired BRL-CAD installation's binary directory to the user's local path:

In the bash shell: export PATH=/usr/brlcad/rel-X.Y.Z:$PATH
In the csh shell:  setenv PATH /usr/brlcad/rel-X.Y.Z:$PATH

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
---------------------

--- BRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS ---

Enables compilation of all 3rd party sources that are provided within a BRL-CAD
source distribution.  If used this option sets all other 3rd party library
build flags to ON by default.  However, that setting can be overridden by
manually setting individual variables. Default is "AUTO" - 3rd party sources
are compiled only if they are not detected as being available and functioning
as expected.

Aliases:  ENABLE_ALL


--- BRLCAD_ENABLE_OPENGL ---

Enable support for OpenGL based Display Managers in BRL-CAD.
Default depends on whether OpenGL is successfully detected -
if it is, default is to enable.

Aliases:  ENABLE_OPENGL


--- BRLCAD_ENABLE_RUNTIME_DEBUG ---

Enables support for application and library debugging facilities.
Disabling the run-time debugging facilities can provide a significant
(10%-30%) performance boost at the expense of extensive error
checking (that in turn help prevent corruption of your data).
Default is "ON", and should only be disabled for read-only render
work where performance is critical.

Aliases:  ENABLE_RUNTIME_DEBUG, ENABLE_RUN_TIME_DEBUG, ENABLE_RUNTIME_DEBUGGING
          ENABLE_RUN_TIME_DEBUGGING


--- BRLCAD_FLAGS_DEBUG ---

Add compiler flags to aid in program debugging.  Defaults to ON.

Aliases:  ENABLE_DEBUG, ENABLE_FLAGS_DEBUG, ENABLE_DEBUG_FLAGS


--- BRLCAD_ENABLE_COMPILER_WARNINGS ---

Use extra compiler warning flags when compiling C/C++ code.  Defaults to ON.

Aliases:  ENABLE_WARNINGS, ENABLE_COMPILER_WARNINGS


--- BRLCAD_ENABLE_STRICT ---

Causes all compilation warnings for C code to be treated as errors.  This is now
the default for BRL-CAD source code, and developers should address issues
discovered by these flags whenever possible rather than disabling strict
mode.

Aliases:  ENABLE_STRICT, ENABLE_STRICT_COMPILE, ENABLE_STRICT_COMPILE_FLAGS


--- ENABLE_ALL_CXX_COMPILE ---

Build all C and C++ files with a C++ compiler.  Defaults to OFF.

Causes compiler options to be set for strict compliance with the
minimum C and C++ standards acceptable according to current BRL-CAD
policy.  The current minimum C standard is ??.
There is no currently defined minimum C++ standard.

Aliases:  ENABLE_POSIX


--- ENABLE_STRICT_COMPILER_STANDARD_COMPLIANCE ---

Build with strict ISO C compliance checking.  Defaults to OFF.

Causes C compiler options to be set for strict compliance with the
appropriate ISO C standard.

Aliases:  STRICT_ISO_C


--- BRLCAD_EXTRADOCS ---

The core option that enables and disables building of BRL-CAD's
DocBook based documentation (includes manuals and man pages for
commands, among other things).  Defaults to ON, but only HTML and MAN
formats are enabled by default - PDF must be enabled separately by use
of this option or one of its aliases.  Note that you may set
environment variable APACHE_FOP to point to your locally installed fop
executable file (which on Linux is usually a shell script with 0755
permissions).
