Phil,

This directory contains the vas4 command which we use for all of our
Lyon-Lamb recording. Refer to the man page. Following is a typical shell
script I have used. Essentially it records a bunch of rle files.

This command will open /dev/vas which is a link to the serial port 
connected to the vas.
