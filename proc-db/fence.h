/* the fence generation is broken into four main parts, consisting of

 * that may attach to the mesh, and the fence as a whole (poles and

 */

/* these are the parameters for the main fence object that gets
 * generated.
 *   the name of the entire resulting fence object may be set as a string.
 *   the point at which the fence starts is where the first pole, and 
 *     the mesh will begin at.  the fence is generated bottom-up (first
 *     quadrant).
 *   the width and height settings here may be overridden by the pole
 *     and/or mesh width and height settings if they are given.  default
 *     fence generation, however, generates the poles based on the
 *     default fence height and width.
 *   mateial and material params are the two defaults that set the
 *     material properties of the fence poles and wires (not separate at
 *     this time)
 *   fence, poles, mesh, and wire are all truth values (1 == TRUE,
 *     0 == FALSE) that indicate whether or not the user will be prompted
 *     for respective values when the program is running in interactive
 *     mode.  that is to say that if the values are (1,1,1,0) respectively,
 *     then the user will be prompted (if in interactive mode) for the
 *     height and width of the fence, poles, and mesh, but will not be
 *     prompted for values for the wire (such as wire radius).  default
 *     values or command-line values are used if not in interactive mode.
 *   the generate fence, poles, and mesh defaults are truth values that
 *     determine whether or not the fence pole and mesh object collections
 *     get generated.  the default is to generate all objects, but this
 *     may be changed through a command-line value
