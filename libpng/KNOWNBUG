Known bugs in libpng version 1.2.5

1. April 22, 2001: pnggccrd.c has been reported to crash on NetBSD when
   reading interlaced PNG files, when assembler code is enabled but running
   on a non-MMX i386 platform.

   STATUS: Under investigation.  The change to pnggccrd.c in libpng-1.2.1
   fixed a problem under FreeBSD but not the problem with NetBSD, which
   still fails as of libpng-1.2.2rc1.
