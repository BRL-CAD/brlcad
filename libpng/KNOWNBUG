Known bugs and suggested enhancements in libpng-1.0.2


1. March 15, 1998 -- OPTIMIZATION -- Kevin Bracey

   Loops need to be optimized everywhere

   Make them count down instead of up -- Kevin Bracey
   
   Optimizing compilers don't need this, and making
   the change would be error prone -- Tom Lane, Glenn R-P

   Question whether i-- or --i is better.

   STATUS: Under investigation, postponed until after
   libpng-1.0.2.  About 160 loops turned around
   in libpng-1.0.2a, for testing.
