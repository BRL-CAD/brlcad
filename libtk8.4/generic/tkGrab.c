/*
 * The grab state machine has four states: ungrabbed, button pressed,
 * grabbed, and button pressed while grabbed.  In addition, there are
 * three pieces of grab state information: the current grab window,
 * the current restrict window, and whether the mouse is captured.
 *
 * The current grab window specifies the point in the Tk window
 * heirarchy above which pointer events will not be reported.  Any
 * window within the subtree below the grab window will continue to
 * receive events as normal.  Events outside of the grab tree will be
 * reported to the grab window.
 *
 * If the current restrict window is set, then all pointer events will
 * be reported only to the restrict window.  The restrict window is
 * normally set during an automatic button grab.
 *
 * The mouse capture state specifies whether the window system will
 * report mouse events outside of any Tk toplevels.  This is set
 * during a global grab or an automatic button grab.
 *
 * The transitions between different states is given in the following
 * table:
 * 
 * Event\State	U	B	G	GB
 * -----------	--	--	--	--
 * FirstPress	B	B	GB	GB
 * Press	B	B	G	GB
 * Release	U	B	G	GB
 * LastRelease	U	U	G	G
 * Grab		G	G	G	G
 * Ungrab	U	B	U	U
 *
 * Note: U=Ungrabbed, B=Button, G=Grabbed, GB=Grab and Button
 *
 * In addition, the following conditions are always true:
 *
 * State\Variable	Grab	     Restrict	     Capture
 * --------------	----	     --------	     -------
 * Ungrabbed		 0		0		0
 * Button		 0		1		1
 * Grabbed		 1		0		b/g
 * Grab and Button	 1		1		1
 *
 * Note: 0 means variable is set to NULL, 1 means variable is set to
 * some window, b/g means the variable is set to a window if a button
 * is currently down or a global grab is in effect.
 *
 * The final complication to all of this is enter and leave events.
 * In order to correctly handle all of the various cases, Tk cannot
 * rely on X enter/leave events in all situations.  The following
 * describes the correct sequence of enter and leave events that
 * should be observed by Tk scripts:
 *
 * Event(state)		Enter/Leave From -> To
 * ------------		----------------------
 * LastRelease(B | GB): restrict window -> anc(grab window, event window)
 * Grab(U | B): 	event window -> anc(grab window, event window)
 * Grab(G):		anc(old grab window, event window) ->
 * 				anc(new grab window, event window)
 * Grab(GB):		restrict window -> anc(new grab window, event window)
 * Ungrab(G):		anc(grab window, event window) -> event window
 * Ungrab(GB):		restrict window -> event window
 *
 * Note: anc(x,y) returns the least ancestor of y that is in the tree
 * of x, terminating at toplevels.
