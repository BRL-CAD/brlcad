# Drag & Drop Tclets

#
# A simple way to create Tcl applications.  This applications will copy a
# droped Tcl file into a copy of a stub application (the user can pick).
# The file is placed into the TEXT resource named "tclshrc" which is
# automatically executed on startup.

# Results:
# 	One success a new Tclet is created.
