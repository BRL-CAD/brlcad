2004-02-18  Peter Spjuth  <peter.spjuth@space.se>

	* tests/grid.test:
	* generic/tkGrid.c: Fixed a bug in grid geometry calculations for
	a shrinking grid. [Bug 899246]

2004-02-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkBind.c (HandleEventGenerate): only modify root[xy]
	with [xy] when they haven't been otherwise set.

2004-02-17  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/imgPhoto.test (imgPhoto-16.1):	Corrected incorrect

2004-02-16  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	Fix for MouseWheel Events (from Daniel Steffen):

	* generic/tkEvent.c (Tk_HandleEvent): On Mac OS X, don't route
	MouseWheel events to the Focus window.  They are sent to the
	window under the pointer on X (and the GenerateMouseWheelEvent
	already got this right.)
	* library/listbox.tcl: On Mac OS, don't use the magic 120
	divisor that is used on Windows.  We may come up with a cleaner
	way to do this for the TOT, but this is simple and will do for the
	8.4 branch.
	* library/text.tcl: Ditto.
	* doc/bind.n: Update the docs to reflect the changes.
	
2004-02-15  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	Backport Mac OS X specific fixes from TOT:

	[event generate].  [Bug #860454] - [Benjamin Riefenstahl]
	* macosx/tkMacOSXKeyboard.c: Add PowerBook keycode 0x34 as <Return>.
	[Benjamin Riefenstahl]

	* macosx/tkMacOSXScrlbr.c: Reworking Vince's fix to [Bug 842952].
	This version is clearer, and works helps keep the mouse better
	pinned to the scrollbar.  I also removed the glitch where the
	scrollbar would jump get its middle over the mouse when you first
	moved it.
	
	* macosx/tkMacOSXClipboard.c (TkSuspendClipboard, TkSelGetSelection):
	add unicode clipboard support. [Patch #840107] (senn)	
	
	* macosx/tkMacOSXDialog.c (NavServicesGetFile): Minor cleanups.
	* (OpenFileFilterProc): Handle FSRef's as well as FSSpec's in the input
	file.  Also convert the FSSpec filename to an C-string before passing
	to MatchOneFile.  [bug 517600]
	* (MatchOneFile): Require the input filename to be a C-string, not a
	pascal string.
	
	* macosx/tkMacOSXDialog.c (MatchOneType): If the Macintosh filetype
	is 0, then automatically pass the fileType check.

	* macosx/tkMacOSXButton.c (TkpDisplayButton): Use the tk text
	drawing for checkbuttons & radiobuttons as well as for labels.
	* macosx/tkMacOSXEvent.c (XSync): New function, need to implement
	this so drawing will get flushed in "update idletasks".
	* tkMacOSXPort.h: convert #define of XSync to function def'n.

	* generic/tkWindow.c:
	* macosx/tkMacOSXDialog.c: added native tk_messageBox command,
	(Tk_MessageBoxObjCmd) for MacOS X platform. [Vince Darley]

	* macosx/tkMacOSXMenu.c: corrected encoding conversion for
	torn-off menu entries (but many other display problems still
	exist with these) [Vince Darley]

	* macosx/tkMacOSXMouseEvent.c: improved handling of events in the
	presence of grabs, particularly activation events. [Vince Darley]
	
	* macosx/tkMacOSXColor.c (GetControlPartColor): Use
	the ThemeBrushes to get the control text color for
	buttons.
	
	* tkMacOSXAppInit.c: Formatting cleanups.
	* tkMacOSXButton.c: Ditto
	* tkMacOSXClipboard.c: Ditto
	* tkMacOSXDebug.c: Ditto
	* tkMacOSXDialog.c: Ditto
	* tkMacOSXDraw.c: Ditto

2004-02-13  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tkWinFont.c (Tk_MeasureChars): backport fixes to bold/italic
	font handling. [Patch 852669] [Bug 478568]
	* tests/textDisp.test: added test for the font measurement 
	problem.

2004-02-13  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* macosx/tkMacOSXDialog.c (Tk_GetOpenFileObjCmd): Use CFStringRef for
	title & message options, not pascal strings.
	(Tk_GetSaveFileObjCmd): Ditto
	(Tk_ChooseDirectoryObjCmd): Ditto
	(NavServicesGetFile): Now that we get CFStrings, we don't need
	to convert them here.

	* macosx/tkMacOSXMenu.c (TkMacOSXDispatchMenuEvent): Cleanup, we don't
	need to handle the Apple Menu picks any more, but the code didn't
	reflect that.

	* macosx/tkMacOSXWm.c (TkSetWMName): Use CFStrings for the Window Title
	name, not Pascal strings.  
	
2004-02-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README:       update to patchlevel 8.4.6

	* library/msgs/eo.msg:	Language support for Esperanto and Polish from

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (Tk_PhotoPutBlock, Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock): 
	* tests/imgPhoto.test (imgPhoto-16.1): Better handling of the case
	when copying from one area of a photo to another triggers a
	resizing of the image.  [Bug 877950]

2004-02-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/menu.tcl (::tk::MbPost): make menubuttons that post
	above or below reverse direction when not enough space is available.

2004-01-28  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tkWinCursor.c: Backported fix for bug #776646 which makes
	* tests/cursor.test: hand2 and fleur native on windows.

2003-01-27  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj: removed erroneous reference
	to mkpsenc.tcl in bundle resources phase (mkpsenc.tcl is already
	part of the copy files phase to Resources/Scripts).

	* macosx/Makefile: added support for 'xcodebuild' on Mac OS X 10.3.

2003-12-31  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj: added missing private headers
	to installed Tk.framework, so that tkInt.h can be included  
	sucessfully from Tk.framework/PrivateHeaders.
	* generic/tkPort.h: corrected include of tkMacOSXPort.h

2003-12-17  Jim Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* macosx/tkMacOSXScrlbr.c: Reworking Vince's fix to [Bug 842952].
	This version is clearer, and works helps keep the mouse better
	pinned to the scrollbar.  I also removed the glitch where the
	scrollbar would jump get its middle over the mouse when you first
	moved it.
	
	Import from TOT.

2003-12-11  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/winMain.c: Backed-out yesterdays change.  Reverted to 1.15 for
	two reasons.  1) problem is best addressed in Tcl's DllMain() and
	2) needs a MinGW custom assembly implimentation as it doesn't
	understand SEH syntax.

2003-12-10  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/winMain.c (WishPanic) : placed ExitProcess() in a __try block
	(SEH) to catch any exceptions that might happen.  As Tcl will call
	Tcl_Finalize from its DllMain due to the unload from ExitProcess()
	unloading Tcl, and if Tcl_Panic had gotten called in an __except
	block handling an exception, this avoid the possibility of not
	being able to exit from the stack being a mess.  Falls to
	TerminateProcess() in the __except case.

	Removed the #ifdef _MSC_VER around DebugBreak as that function
	exists in kernel32.dll and is not compiler dependent.  I'd prefer
	to use 'if (IsDebuggerPresent()) DebugBreak();' but
	IsDebuggerPresent() isn't available in all kernel32.dll modules
	for all versions of windows.

2003-12-10  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/CrtImgType.3: Fixed line-transposition error found by Eric
	Raymond. [Bug 857159]

2003-12-03  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tk.h:		Bumped patch level to 8.4.5.1 to distinguish
	* unix/configure.in:	CVS snapshots from the 8.4.5 release.
	* unix/tk.spec:
	* win/configure.in:

	* unix/configure:	autoconf (2.13)
	* win/configure:

2003-12-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkMenu.c (MenuVarProc): prevent this from triggering
	while interp is being destroyed.

2x03-11-21  Benjamin Riefenstahl  <Benjamin.Riefenstahl@epost.de>

	*** 8.4.5 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* macosx/tkMacOSXKeyboard.c: Add PowerBook keycode 0x34 as

	with that generated by Makefile.

2003-11-15  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Fixes pkgIndex.tcl generation so a symbols build
	is loaded when Tcl is symbols.

2003-11-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: improve AIX --enable-64bit handling

	* generic/tkButton.c (ConfigureButton): abort option processing if
	the button was deleted. [Bug #824479]

	* generic/tkMenuDraw.c (TkPostSubmenu): add {} around menu name in
	case it has spaces when calling Tcl_VarEval.  This is a hack until
	this is rewritten for proper Tcl_Obj handling. [Bug #723856]

	* library/tkfbox.tcl (::tk::dialog::file::Update): optimize the
	dir/files list separation by using the -tails, -directory and
	-type option of 'glob'.  Also passes the glob the -filetypes
	filters instead of calling string match over each file.
	[Patch #833819]
	(::tk::dialog::file::ActivateEnt): allow typing filename into
	entry when tk_getOpenFile -multiple 1 is specified. [Bug #788069]

	* generic/tkListbox.c (ListboxDeleteSubCmd, ListboxListVarProc):
	free itemconfig data when removing it from table. [Bug #836483]

	XGCValues.function parameter when filling rectangles.
	[Bug #820278] [Patch #820282]

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (ImgPhotoBlendComplexAlpha): add alpha
	blending for images with partial transparency.  Only operates for
	15bpp+ display, and not on Mac at all. [Bug 809157]

	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in: define TK_LIB_FLAG, TK_LIB_SPEC,
	TK_BUILD_LIB_SPEC, TK_STUB_LIB_SPEC, TK_STUB_LIB_PATH, and
	TK_BUILD_STUB_LIB_PATH for tkConfig.sh [Bug #826614]

	* unix/Makefile.in (SHLIB_LD_FLAGS): include in Makefile as it is
	used in MAKE_LIB sometimes (ie: AIX-64) [Bug #829686] (jimix)

2003-11-01  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* library/msgs/nl.msg: Updated messages from Arjen Markus and
	Pascal Scheffers.  Thanks!  [Patch 820519]

2003-10-29  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* library/tkfbox.tcl (IconList_Create,IconList_Add): Added option
	munging to allow some control of foreground colours on Unix in the
	same way that you can influence the background.  [Bug 795717]

2003-10-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (GetFontAttributes): place extra check for NULL
	family against bad X servers.

	* win/tkWinImage.c (XGetImageZPixmap): add separate 16bpp
	XGetImage code to correctly handle 16bpp requests.  This appears
	to never have worked correctly.

	* tests/focusTcl.test (setup1): expand frame size to allow for
	correct visibility of windows that use larger default fonts.

2003-10-28  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/tk.tcl (::tk::PlaceWindow): Added check for empty string
	first when determining placement strategy. [Bug 819284]

2003-10-22  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/dialog.tcl (tk_dialog): Constrain the dialog to be
	fairly sensibly sized and placed.  [Bug 827535]

2003-10-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tkInt.decls:
	* generic/tkStubInit.c:

	* tests/listbox.test (13.3): correct result size

	buttons with just images.

2003-10-06  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/ConfigWidg.3:	Removed reference to Tk_Offset from the
	NAME section to resolve mkLinks conflict with SetOptions.3 [Bug 404197]

	* unix/configure.in:	Reconfigured to use $TCL_PREFIX as the
	default value of --prefix, and also added warning when a TK_PREFIX
	value different from TCL_PREFIX is selected, since [package require Tk]
	fails in that configuration. [Bugs 428627,765642]

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_PATH_TCLCONFIG):	Corrected search path so
	that alpha and beta releases of Tcl are not favored. [Bug 608698]

	* unix/configure.in:	Added check that version of Tcl header found
	by configure matches that of the Tk we wish to build.  As long as
	the Tk sources insist on lockstep releases, Tk's configuration should
	verify that's what we have.  [Bug 749088]

	* unix/configure:	autoconf (2.13)
	* unix/mkLinks:		make mklinks

	Added support for all applicable customizable makefile variables
	from tcl/macosx/Makefile.

	* macosx/README:
	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj: ensure that the versioned
	wishX.X script works correctly when Tk.framework with multiple
	versions is present by referring to a copy of 'Wish Shell.app'
	located in Tk.framework/Versions/X.X/Resources.

2003-09-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_FRAMEWORK): Added note to make it clearer

2003-09-26  Benjamin Riefenstahl  <Benjamin.Riefenstahl@epost.de>

	* macosx/tkMacOSXWm.c (TkWmStackorderToplevelWrapperMap): Add

	broken by changes to tcl buildsystem.

2003-07-19  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/scale.tcl: Fix for bug 706765 to correctly handle the 
	-sliderrelief option while moving the thumb.

2003-07-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (Tk_DrawChars): do not make XGetGeometry call
	that prevents overwidth lines as it requires a roundtrip call to
	the X server for every string drawn.  Hard-code max width to 32768
	until a beter solution to get max width is made.

	* library/panedwindow.tcl: use widget-specific Priv slots for
	pwAfterId and panecursor items to correctly handle cursor changes
	with adjacant panedwindows.

	* generic/tkEvent.c (Tk_HandleEvent): correct XCreateIC call for
	TK_XIM_SPOT usage. [Bug 742660] (takahashi)

	* win/tkWinCursor.c (TkGetCursorByName): Fix bug 420510 to provide
	consistency between unix and windows -cursor option. (thoyts)

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: doubled the TK_MULTI_MAX_PATH value to ~10K.
	This is a short-term solution until the -multiple option is
	extended.  [Bug 641261]

2003-07-18  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/panedwindow.test (panedwindow-30.2): 
	* generic/tkPanedWindow.c (Tk_PanedWindowObjCmd): Ensure that we
	can share GCs between a panedwindow and its sash proxy, even if
	the panedwindow is in a toplevel with a different visual. [Bug 702230]

2003-07-17  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: Changes for new tcl buildsystem.

	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/jingham.pbxuser:
	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj:
	Changes for new tcl buildsystem.
	Changed build to include tk specific html help in Tk.framework
	instead of Tcl.framework.
	Set default SYMROOT in target options to simplify setting up PB
	(manually setting common build folder for tcl & tk no longer needed).

	* macosx/README: Updated info for changes to buildsystem,
	html help location and PB setup.

2003-07-17  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/photo.n: [$photo put] has been able to take rectangles of
	pixel colours, specified as lists of lists, for years.  Now this
	is a documented feature.  [Bug 728952]

	* generic/tkPanedWindow.c (PanedWindowReqProc): Fix from Eric
	Boudaillier so panedwindows get their geometry right even when
	their children don't know their size initially. [Bug 738143]
	* doc/panedwindow.n: Removed sentences about the use of [update
	idletasks] with this command, as that is no longer necessary with
	the fix from Bug 738143. [Bug 747814]

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (ImgPhotoCmd): Rewrote subcommand processing
	to never jump to the end of the switch.  I find that confusing as
	I can't see whether there's processing still to be done from a
	quick glance at the code, unlike with a direct return. [Bug 771988]
	(ImgPhotoCmd, ImgPhotoSetSize, ImgPhotoInstanceSetSize): Try harder
	to avoid zero-length mallocs()... [Bug 404421]

2003-07-16  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkPack.c (ConfigureSlaves): silence compiler warning

	[Bug 755906] (mistachkin)

2003-07-15  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tkUnixEvent.c (TkpCloseDisplay): Don't
	test for XCloseIM bug when the XFree86 version
	is newer than 4.0 since the layout of the
	XIM structure has changed. The check is not
	needed for newer XFree86 releases since
	the bug we are checking for was fixed in
	the 4.2.99.2 release. [Bug 755530]

	* generic/tkMenu.c
	* generic/tkMenu.h
	* generic/tkMenuDraw.c: 
	* tests/menu.test: fixed complex bug in menu clone cleanup
	[Bug#465324] and removed 'knownBug' from a test.

2003-07-09  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/send.test: Strengthened constraints to stop accidental
	smashing of Xserver access; some systems (*ahem* mine *ahem*)
	require xhost-style security for all use...  :^/

2003-07-07  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tkImage.c (TkDeleteAllImages,etc.): Stopped the deleting

	*** 8.4.3 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* changes: updated for 8.4.3

	* unix/Makefile.in: do not run autoconf during 'make dist' as the
	configure is now a CVS-maintained file and should be up-to-date.

2003-05-19  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj: changed tkConfig.sh location
	in versioned framework subdirectories to be identical to location
	in framework toplevel; fixed stub library symbolic links to be
	tk version specific.

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c: use gb2312-raw as the alias for gb2312*
	charset fonts.  gb2312.enc was made to be euc-cn for Tcl because
	that is what is most often meant, but X really wants the original
	(-raw) gb2312 encoding. [Bug 557030]

2003-05-14  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/msgs/fr.msg: updated msg catalog. [Bug #737790] (zolli)

2003-05-13  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	backport of Mac OS X specific changes on trunk since 8.4.2:
	
	* macosx/tkMacOSXClipboard.c (TkSelGetSelection): Convert
	'\r' to '\n' on the way into Tcl. (ingham)

	* macosx/tkMacOSXMenu.c (EventuallyInvokeMenu): New function,
	used to invoke menu commands at idle time.
	(TkMacOSXDispatchMenuEvent): Don't immediately dispatch menu
	commands, wait till the idle loop to do so.  This is more like
	what is done on Windows, and avoids the crash from destroying
	a menu in it's command. (ingham)

	* macosx/tkMacOSXHLEvents.c (ReallyKillMe): Don't force the shell
	to exit.  According to the OS X HI guidelines, it should be
	possible to cancel an attempt to quit, and if we force the kill,
	here, it would not be possible to implement this. (ingham)

	* macosx/tkMacOSXApplication.r (removed):
	* macosx/tkMacOSXLibrary.r (removed):
	* macosx/tkMacOSXResource.r (removed):
	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj:

	removed obsolete unused resource files. (steffen)

2003-05-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkCanvPoly.c (PolygonToPostscript):

	* mac/tkMacButton.c (TkpDisplayButton):       to correctly display
	* macosx/tkMacOSXButton.c (TkpDisplayButton): mixture of disabledfg,
	* unix/tkUnixButton.c (TkpDisplayButton):     selectcolor, indicator,
	* win/tkWinButton.c (TkpDisplayButton):       etc.  *buttons will
	now only stipple the image, unless no disabledfg is given, in which 
	case it will stipple the whole button.

	* library/bgerror.tcl: make bgerror dialog topmost on Windows to
	prevent it being covered by other windows.

	* unix/tkUnixButton.c (TkpDisplayButton): Use the normalTextGc when
	* win/tkWinButton.c (TkpDisplayButton):   displaying disabled text
	that have images, as they get a gray50 stipple as well and the
	disabledGc is not set up correctly for font drawing. [Bug #477740]

2003-04-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkCanvBmap.c: s/CreateBitmap/TkcCreateBitmap as Windows
	has a CreateBitmap function already.

	* generic/tkCursor.c: s/GetCursor/TkcGetCursor as Windows has a
	GetCursor func already, which causes compiler warnings.

2003-04-02  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	and TCL_BUILD_STUB_LIB_SPEC. These variables are
	already set in tclConfig.sh.

2003-03-22  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/makefile.vc:

2003-03-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/msgbox.tcl (Tk::MessageBox): Stop buttons from being
	very wide when a messageBox has a lot of content. [Bug #701812]

2003-03-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixWm.test:  Constrained all tests older than revision 1.21
	to run only on Unix.  Alternative approach did not match maintainer
	habits.
	* tests/spinbox.test (spinbox-17.4): Avoid long failure message.

2003-03-13  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/makefile.vc: Backed the version to 8.4 on the 8.4 branch.
	(I just loathe sticky tags).
	
2002-03-11  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/makefile.vc: Backported the code that makes the makefile
	build pkgIndex.tcl as part of the install step.

	*** 8.4.2 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

2003-02-28  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/bind.test (bind-16.44): 
	* generic/tkBind.c (ExpandPercents): Only allow events to see
	those expansions that are actually valid for them, and force the
	substitution of the rest as "??".  This stops some crashes on
	Windows and gets rid of bogus values everywhere.  [Bug #612110]

2003-02-26  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* macosx/README: correct 8.4.3 refs to 8.4.2.

	menusInitialized on finalize. [Bug #548729]

2003-02-25  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/tkMacOSXHLEvents.c: fixed conversion of apple event
	parameters to posix style path names.
	[Bug #621672] (steffen, Benjamin Riefenstahl) 

	* macosx/tkMacOSXDialog.c: 
	* macosx/tkMacOSXWm.c:
	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj:
	* macosx/tkMacOSXUtil.c (removed):
	* macosx/tkMacOSXUtil.h (removed): removed all references to
	tkMacOSXUtil.{c,h}, made obsolete by the patch above. [Bug #621672]
	
2003-02-24  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (CreateClosestFont, CanUseFallback): use the
	first best font match in user font path. [Bug #647497] (dal zotto)

	* generic/tkListbox.c (ListboxSelectionSubCmd): 
	* tests/listbox.test: Allow 'selection includes' to respond when
	disabled (but only 'includes'). [Bug #632514]

	* unix/tkUnixButton.c (TkpDisplayButton): Correct visual display
	of disabled check/radiobutton to be more distinctive on unix.
	* tests/unixButton.test: [Bug #669595] (hintermayer)

	* doc/panedwindow.n: clarified the need to use 'update idle' when
	adding unmapped windows.  Needs further examination. [Bug #605105]

	* generic/tkEntry.c (SpinboxWidgetObjCmd, EntryWidgetObjCmd):
	* tests/entry.test:   return 1 if selection is present even if
	* tests/spinbox.test: entry/spinbox is disabled, as selection get
	will still return the selection (although selection still ignore
	modify requests when entry/spinbox is disabled). [Bug #637828]

2003-02-24  Benjamin Riefenstahl  <Benjamin.Riefenstahl@epost.de>

	* tkMacOSXDialog.c (NavServicesGetFile): Fix bug with
	kNavCtlSetSelection - control data should be a pointer
	not a handle.
	
2003-02-21  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/clrpick.tcl (color::BuildDialog): 
	* library/msgbox.tcl (MessageBox): Yet more places that did
	complex and fragile width calculations instead of using grid,
	though with these it is the -uniform option that saves the day.

	* library/tkfbox.tcl (file::Create): This procedure was really
	very crufty in how it went about creating the GUI.  It is far
	easier and more robust to use the grid geometry manager than it is
	to tune the results of pack with tweaks to -width.  [Bug #673722]

	* library/comdlg.tcl (FDGetFileTypes): Set an upper limit on how
	long a file type item description string can get due to appending
	of types. [Bug #617392]

	* tests/panedwindow.test (panedwindow-30.1): 
	* generic/tkPanedWindow.c (DisplayPanedWindow, DisplayProxyWindow): 
	Use the window's depth, not the screen's default depth. [Bug #671122]

2003-02-20  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	binding for corresponding Quit menu item shortcut.

	* unix/configure: regen.

2003-02-20  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tkWinScrlbr.c (UpdateScrollbar): use SIF_DISABLENOSCROLL to
	"disable" scrollbar when on Windows when there is nothing to
	scroll.  This is Windows style, and fixes [Bug #624116].

	* tests/panedwindow.test: 
	* generic/tkPanedWindow.c (ValidSashIndex): corrected to note that
	2 panes must exist before any one sash does. [tcllib Bug #689258]

2003-02-20  Peter Spjuth  <peter.spjuth@space.se>

	* tests/panedwindow.test:
	* generic/tkPanedWindow.c: Fixed calculation of the last slave's

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c (GetDataBlock): Removed pointless static
	variable ZeroDataBlock [Bug #664788]

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (CanUseFallback): Added argument, passed
	through from callers to FindSubFontForChar(), so that pointers
	into the old subfont table to be updated when that table is
	reallocated, avoiding a (sometimes fatal) FMR.
	[Bugs #618872 and #689357]

2003-02-19  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/tkMacOSXKeyEvent.c: fix for uninitialized var warning.

2003-02-19  Jim Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* macosx/tkMacOSXMouseEvents.c (GeneratePollingEvents): In the case
	where there was a capture window, we were sending the events to
	the capture window.  But the capture window (return value or
	TkMacOSXGetCapture) is always a toplevel.  So this is wrong in 
	the case that the Event's toplevel IS the capture window - in
	which case the event should go to the subwindow most closely
	containing the event.
	
2003-02-19  Benjamin Riefenstahl <Benjamin.Riefenstahl@epost.de>
	       & Jim Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	This patch changes the default Tk behavior so that events

	Tk has looked at them.

	"stopProcessing".

	"handledByTk".
	(TkMacOSXProcessMouseEvent): Handle clicks in the "traffic
	lights" in the window title when the window (or app) is

	translation mechanisms.  It also improves dead key handling.

	(InitKeyEvent): Add.
	(DecodeViaUnicodeResource): Rename
	KeycodeToUnicodeViaUnicodeResource.

	(GetKeyboardLayout): Use a boolean flag instead of a special
	layout id.

	implementation to return a Unicode string instead of directly
	filling an XEvent.
	(KeycodeToUnicodeViaKCHRResource): Ditto.
	(KeycodeToUnicodeViaUnicodeResource): Add handling for callers
	that don't want deadkey processing (i.e. XKeycodeToKeysym).
	(KeycodeToUnicodeViaKCHRResource): Ditto.
	(KeycodeToUnicodeViaUnicodeResource): Clear deadKeyState if a
	character was produced.
	(KeycodeToUnicodeViaKCHRResource): Use CFString and current

	(TkMacOSXProcessKeyboardEvent): Add some heuristics to improve
	keyup events.
	(deadKeyState): Split into deadKeyStateUp and deadKeyStateDown.
	(GenerateKeyEvent): Change interface and implementation to accept
	a Unicode string instead of individual characters.
	(GenerateKeyEvent): Don't generate string representations for
	special characters. 

	* macosx/tkMacOSXEvent.h (TkMacOSXKeycodeToUnicode): Add
	prototype. 

	* macosx/tkMacOSXKeyboard.c (KCHRPtr): Remove.
	(XKeycodeToKeysym): Use TkMacOSXKeycodeToUnicode instead of
	KeyTranslate.
	(XKeycodeToKeysym): Support latin-1 keysyms.

	This patch reverts the hack to put icons in menus that Vince put
	in yesterday (but preserves the bug fix in that submission.)

	* macosx/tkMacOSXMenu.c (SetMenuTitle): revert treating 
	"<bullet> number" as a request to put icon number <number> in
	the menu.

2003-02-17  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkEvent.c (Tk_HandleEvent): Fixup button
	press state saving code, it was incorrectly converting
	normal motion events into button press and motion

	* tests/canvRect.test:
	* tests/canvText.test:
	* tests/canvas.test:

2003-01-28  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkInt.h (TkDisplay,TkMainInfo):
	* generic/tkObj.c (windowObjType):
	* generic/tkWindow.c (Tk_DestroyWindow):
	* tests/wm.test (wm-deletion-epoch-1.1):
	Moved 'deletionEpoch' field from TkDisplay to TkMainInfo.
	Reworked windowObj type.  Fixes Tk Bug #671330 "segfault when e.g.
	deiconifying destroyed window"

2003-01-23  D. Richard Hipp  <drh@hwaci.com>

	* library/entry.tcl: Fix the KeyPress binding on the entry widget
	so that it enters text from left to right (not right to left) even
	if the mouse button is being held down.  [Bug #673687]

2003-01-22  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tkFrame.c (TkToplevelWindowForCommand): Added way of
	mapping from command names to tkwins-for-toplevels.
	* generic/tkImage.c (Tk_ImageObjCmd): Added check to make sure
	that you're not creating an image named the same as .'s command,
	which refixes 220891, even when the name of the command has been
	changed with 'rename'.  The error message is better too.
	* tests/image.test (image-1.10,image-1.11): Updated to match new
	error message and added test for the rename case.

2003-01-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkImage.c (DeleteImage): delete the image's entry in the
	image table correctly when there are no more instances.  This
	reopens bug 220891. [Bug #669759]

2003-01-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/loadTk.n: note that ::safe::loadTk has a prereq on
	::safe::interpCreate or ::safe::interpInit. [Bug #669159]

	* doc/photo.n: $image put only accepts -format and -to, and note
	extended use of -to.

2003-01-17  D. Richard Hipp <drh@hwaci.com>
	* generic/tkCanvUtil.c: The clipping algorithm introduced on 2003-01-08
	was unnecessarily aggressive in reducing the size of the clipping box.
	This did not cause a problem for normal display, but did create
	trouble for some extensions that attempt to render a canvas on a
	GDI printer under Windows.  The patch here relaxes the constraints on
	the clipping box somewhat.  [Bug #663981]

2003-01-14  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>
	* generic/tkSelect.c (Tk_CreateSelHandler):
	Fix for #666346 "Selection handling crashes under KDE 3.0"
	* tests/unixSelect.test (unixSelect-1.20): Added test case.

2003-01-13  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c (Tk_ChooseDirectoryObjCmd,
	ChooseDirectoryValidateProc, Tk_MessageBoxObjCmd):
	Remove unused tsdPtr variable. Use TEXT macro
	instead of _T macro since _T does not work
	under Cygwin. Declare flags as UINT to avoid
	compiler warning when compiling with mingw.

2003-01-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/Makefile.in: Add TCL_DEFS to AC_FLAGS
	so that compiler flags defined by Tcl get
	passed to the compiler. Add empty rule
	for cat.c so that Tk compiles under msys.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl, this pulls
	in a subst of TCL_DEFS, it also defines
	USE_THREAD_ALLOC when threads are used
	and it updates the SC_ENABLE_SYMBOLS
	and SC_PROG_TCLSH macros to match the
	ones used in Tcl.

2003-01-10  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tkUnixEvent.c (OpenIM): Remove unused variable
	(Fixes: #664780 "SGI warning: OpenIM")

	* generic/tkCanvLine.c:
	* generic/tkCanvas.h:
	* generic/tkCanvUtil.c: Clip long lines so that they will display
	properly even on windowing systems where coordinates are expressed
	as 16-bit numbers.  [Bug #663981]

2003-01-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkFrame.c (CreateFrame): throw a Tcl error instead of a
	panic when we cannot get a main window and appname is NULL.  This
	can indicate that a user tried to create a frame/toplevel while Tk
	was dying. [Bug #661792]

2002-12-27  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tkText.h: ANSI unfriendly typedef for TkTextBTree
	repaired for C++ compilers.

2002-12-27  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (WaitForEvent): process Map and Unmap events
	as well as Configure events during WaitFor{Configure|Map}Notify.
	Fixes [Bug 578569] (WaitForMapNotify could process Map and Unmap
	events out of order, making Tk think a window was unmapped when
	it really wasn't).

2002-12-18  Todd M. Helfter  <tmh@purdue.edu>

	* doc/label.n: Fixed documentation of the -compound option to
	the label widget.  The option was simply missing from the
	man page [Bug 577540]

2002-12-17  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/photo.n: Fixed documentation of the put subcommand to no
	longer talk about files and to mention that you can use colour
	names for working with solid colours.  [Bug 640026]

2002-12-13  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tkMain.c (Tk_Main):  Call on Tcl*StartupScript*() routines
	to store the startup script, if any.  [Bug 616245].

2002-12-10  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: tclThreadTest.obj not required to link
	tktest.exe [Bug 651396]

2002-12-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkEntry.c (ConfigureEntry): keep a flag to indicate when
	a var is traced to prevent double-traces caused by configuring the
	widget in traces with validation on. (dejong)

2002-12-07  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkInt.decls: add TkWinSetHINSTANCE decl
	* generic/tkIntPlatDecls.h: regen
	* generic/tkStubInit.c: regen
	* win/tkWinInit.c (TkpInit):  While init and cleanup aren't correct
	* win/tkWinX.c (TkWinXInit):  in DllMain, we had to specify the
	* win/tkWin32Dll.c (DllMain): true HINSTANCE or the resources of a
	dynamic Tk weren't being loaded correctly.  Created a new function
	TkWinSetHINSTANCE for this purpose.

2002-12-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tkWinX.c (TkWinXInit):      Move cleanup into an exit handler
	* win/tkWin32Dll.c (DllMain):     to ensure that it will be called
	* win/tkWinWm.c (TkWinWmCleanup): without having to unload the dll.
	Also reset the static int initialized on cleanup to allow reinit.

2002-12-01  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/event.test (_keypress, _text_ind_to_x_y): Force focus to
	widget in _keypress method to avoid problems with window managers
	that use focus follows mouse. [Bug 526209]

2002-12-01  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/wm.test: Add wm-transient-6.3 to check that a transient
	remains withdrawn when it is first withdrawn and then turned into
	a transient.
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c:
	* win/tkWinWm.c: Replace WM_TRANSIENT_WITHDRAWN with WM_WITHDRAWN
	and set this flag whenever a window is explicitly withdrawn. This
	fixes the test case added above. [Bug 644356]

2002-11-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/textDisp.test:
	* generic/tkTextDisp.c (TkTextSeeCmd): handle see for unmapped
	text displays. [Bug #641778]

2002-11-19  Jim Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* macosx/tkMacOSXScrlbr.c (TkpDisplayScrollbar): If the
	scrollbar width is set to 12 or less (but 12 is what you 
	should use) use the small metric scrollbar.

	(UpdateControlValues): Fix thinko in setting off AUTO_ADJUST for
	the place geometry manager.
	
2002-11-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: add macosx/*.tcl (buildTkConfig.tcl in
	particular) to the dist target.

2002-11-14  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Tk_DestroyWindow, DeleteWindowsExitProc):
	Add TkHalfdeadWindow type and halfdeadWindowList to keep track of
	windows that were only partially deallocated before a call to
	exit. Finish cleaning up these windows in DeleteWindowsExitProc.
	Keep track of cleanup status in Tk_DestroyWindow so that a window
	with a Destroy binding which calls exit will get fully destroyed.
	* tests/window.test: Add Tk_DestroyWindow tests for an assortment
	of half dead window cases. [Bug 630533]

2002-11-10  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	removal of libtkstub before Wish was built.

2002-11-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixWm.test: Add short delay to test unixWm-51.7
	to account for raise/lower changes in TIP 107. This allows
	the test case to pass under Window Maker on Linux.

2002-11-07  Peter Spjuth  <peter.spjuth@space.se>

	* tests/place.test:
	* generic/tkPlace.c: place info did not return all settings,
	and didn't make sure the result was a proper list.
	Put '-in' first in result to be more consistent with how
	grid/pack info behaves. [Bug #635025][Bug #532022]

2002-11-07  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: added macosx/README to dist target.
	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj: fix to 'wish' script
	to allow it to work when not installed into '/'.

2002-11-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Check that AR, RANLIB, and RC
	are found on the path when building with gcc.

2002-11-04  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj: added Wish linker flag
	-headerpad_max_install_names to allow use of 'install_name_tool'.
	fixed tkConfig.sh generation and redo_prebinding in the case where
	Tk is not installed alongside Tcl.

2002-11-03  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/winMain.c (Tcl_AppInit): Calls Registry_Init() and
	Dde_Init() when STATIC_BUILD and TCL_USE_STATIC_PACKAGES macros
	are set.

	* win/makefile.vc:  linkexten option now sets the
	TCL_USE_STATIC_PACKAGES	macro which also adds the registry and
	dde static lib files to the link of the shell. [Patch 479697]

	* win/rules.vc: Matches the one from Tcl.

	* win/buildall.vc.bat: More useful commentary.

2002-11-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* win/makefile.vc (TCLREGLIBNAME): Updated to registry 1.1.

2002-10-29  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/README: added info on new package searching in
	Frameworks directories.
	
2002-10-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	*** 8.4.1 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* changes: updated for 8.4.1 release

2002-10-21  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/README: revised according to Jim's suggestions
	* macosx/tkMacOSXAppInit.c: use standard PATH_MAX from <limits.h>
	
2002-10-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/winMain.c (WinMain, main): remove obsolete SetMessageQueue call

	* win/configure: Regen. 
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Check for bug in Cygwin version
	of windres and work around that case by passing a POSIX path
	instead of a Windows native path. One can't always pass a POSIX
	path because the mingw native toolchain accepts only Windows
	native paths. (dejong)

	* win/tkWinPort.h: define OPEN_MAX only if not defined.
	[Patch #625472] (howell)

2002-10-18  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tkMacAppInit.c: removed tcltest dependency.
	[Bug #592639] (porter)

2002-10-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/imgPhoto.test:
	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (ImgPhotoConfigureMaster): fix arg handling
	for missing -format or -data options. [Bug #624974]

	* tests/text.test:                    properly return the number of
	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (ControlUtfProc): bytes consumed. [Bug #624732]

2002-10-17  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/README: info specific to building and running
	TclTk on Mac OS X, answers to tcl-mac list FAQs.
	* macosx/Makefile: permission fix after embedded install.
	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj: after install, fix
	permissions of uninstalled products.

2002-10-17  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj: added TEXT document
	type to plist so that files can be dragged onto Wish Shell.

	* macosx/tkMacOSXInit.c:
	* macosx/tkMacOSXFont.c: added private proc
	TkMacOSXUseAntialiasedText() to enable/disable quickdraw
	text antialiasing where available, default is enabled.
	Added a linked boolean ::tk::mac::antialiasedtext with
	write trace to allow control of antialiasing from tcl.

2002-10-16  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/tkMacOSXMenu.c: fix to accelerators shown in menus
	with non-alphanumeric keys.
	* macosx/tkMacOSXKeyEvent.c: 
	* macosx/tkMacOSXKeyboard.c: applied first patch from [Patch
	#622582] to fix some of [Bug #616988].  Further work is needed
	in this area, but this will let foreign keyboards at least work
	reasonably with Tk.

2002-10-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: add AIX-5 ppc build support. Remove unused
	SC_ENABLE_MEMDEBUG.

	* win/configure:
	* win/tcl.m4: Add --enable-shared=mem support.

2002-10-10  Peter Spjuth  <peter.spjuth@space.se>

	* tests/grid.test:
	* generic/tkGrid.c: The grid size was not updated properly
	when removing a widget from a grid. [Bug #621241] (forssen)

2002-10-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/canvPs.test: tests for canvas embedded window ps generation
	* generic/tkCanvWind.c (CanvasPsWindow): removed dead code loop.
	* generic/tkCanvas.h: moved TkColormapData struct to tkCanvPs.c
	* generic/tkCanvPs.c (TkImageGetColor): corrected bogus use of
	TkColormapData on Windows (Windows now requires RGB pixel data
	from image).
	* win/tkWinImage.c (XGetImage, XGetImageZPixmap): added support
	for generating ps for embedded widgets on canvases on Windows,
	tested for 8, 16, 24 and 32-bit depths (XGetImageZPixmap not used).

	* library/tk.tcl: simplified the adding of extra <ISO_Left_Tab>
	and <hpBackTab> events to <<PrevWindow>>.

2002-10-09  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/README: doc'ed --enable-symbols options.
	* unix/Makefile.in: comment docs
	* unix/configure: regen
	* unix/tcl.m4: replaced SC_ENABLE_MEMDEBUG with a more intelligent
	SC_ENABLE_SYMBOLS that takes yes|no|mem|all as options now.

2002-10-09  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tk.h:  Added reminder comment to edit
	macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj when version number changes.

2002-10-09  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: don't remove tclsh after building embedded.
	
	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj: bumped version to 8.4.1;
	added missing library/mkpsenc.tcl to framework.

2002-10-09  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkInt.decls(tkIntXlib): added XQueryTree declaration for
	mac & aqua, since it's now called from ParentXId via Tk_HandleEvent.
	* generic/tkIntXlibDecls.h:
	* generic/tkStubInit.c: regen.
	* mac/tkMacXStubs.c: added XQueryTree stub

	* mac/tkMacEmbed.c (TkpUseWindow): check that container window
	has -container option set (sync with other platforms).

	* mac/tkMacBitmap.c:
	* mac/tkMacFont.c: 
	* mac/tkMacSend.c: 
	* mac/tkMacTest.c: 
	* mac/tkMacWm.c: CONSTification.

	tk library projects.

2002-10-09  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (ImgPhotoSetSize): Only error-out if we
	fail to allocate a non-empty buffer; getting a NULL when we
	allocate an empty buffer is no problem since nothing will look at
	the value anyway. [Bug 619544]
	Also tidied up file to take into account the fact that we're using
	32 bits per pixel in the master to accommodate the alpha channel
	as well as RGB.

2002-10-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/winButton.test: add option clear to top to prevent option
	leakage from other tests causing problems. [Bug #582382]

	* generic/tkPanedWindow.c (Tk_PanedWindowObjCmd): leave the
	DestroyPanedWindow proc to free the pwPtr, add a Preserve
	reference to the pwPtr->tkwin.
	(DestroyPanedWindow): Release the pwPtr->tkwin.

	* generic/tkFocus.c (TkFocusFilterEvent): Ignore event if we are
	focusing into a dead window. [Bug #588831] (griffin)

2002-10-02  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* macosx/tkMacOSXScrlbr.c (TkpDisplayScrollbar): Put the Tk scrollbar
	pointer into the control reference data for the Mac scrollbar, so we
	can get it out again in the ScrollbarActionProc.

2002-10-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkText.c (TextBlinkProc): don't blink the cursor unless
	it is visible. [Bug #616791] [Patch #614474] (bonfield)

	* tests/entry.test: added entry-20.7
	* generic/tkEntry.c (EntryTextVarProc): check if the entry is
	being deleted before handling an associated textvariable.
	[Bug #607390 #617446]

2002-10-01  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/unixSelect.test (unixSelect-1.1[89]): Altered these tests
	to work around [Bug #616923]
	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c (SelRcvIncrProc,TkSelPropProc): It turns out
	a much simpler and more robust solution is possible if we leverage
	Tcl's encoding engine by using the same code path as for the
	normal string selection.  It might be a bit slower, but it should
	be a lot more correct.  [Bug #614650]

2002-09-30  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/panedwindow.test: added panedwindow-28.[12]
	* generic/tkPanedWindow.c (PanedWindowCmdDeletedProc): 
	(Tk_PanedWindowObjCmd): when destroying the panedwindow, destroy
	the proxy before the parent to avoid dependency conflicts.
	[Bug #616589]

2002-09-30  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/unixSelect.test: Test for various things that can fail to
	work in 8.4.0...
	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c (TkSelPropProc,SelRcvIncrProc): Incremental
	transfers of UTF8_STRING selections should now work; Tk will now
	tag them with the right size and only transfer complete UTF8
	characters.  Previously, things only worked when the transfer
	could only happen in one go, and even then not always. [Bug 614650]

	* doc/bind.n: Doc-fix to mention that %A substitutes UNICODE
	characters rather than ASCII ones.  Tk's done this ever since 8.1
	in any case; after all, it is the right thing to do.

2002-09-27  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* README:		Bumped to version 8.4.1 to avoid confusion
	* generic/tk.h:		of CVS snapshots with release 8.4.0.

	* unix/tcl.m4: improve AIX-4/5 64bit compilation support.

	* unix/Makefile.in: add macosx subdir to dist target.
	Do not generate .Z, only .gz and .zip in alldist target.

2002-09-18  Mumit Khan  <khan@nanotech.wisc.edu>

	Added basic Cygwin support.

	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_PATH_TCLCONFIG): Support one-tree build.
	(SC_PATH_TKCONFIG): Likewise.
	(SC_PROG_TCLSH): Likewise.
	(SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Assume real Cygwin port and remove -mno-cygwin 
	flags.  Add -mwin32 to extra_cflags and extra_ldflags.
	Remove ``-e _WinMain@16'' from LDFLAGS_WINDOW.
	* win/configure: Regenerate.

	* win/tkWinPort.h (tchar.h): Do not include on Cygwin.
	(_T): Define for Cygwin.
	* win/winMain.c (main): Conditionally define.

2002-09-26  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: preserve environment value of INSTALL_ROOT.
	When embedding only use deployment build. Force relink before
	embedded build to ensure new linker flags are picked up.

	* macosx/buildTkConfig.tcl (new):
	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj: synthesize tkConfig.sh
	based on tclConfig.sh in Tcl.framework and tkConfig.sh.in.
	Add symbolic links to debug lib, stub libs and tkConfig.sh
	in framework toplevel. Made tkIntXlibDecls.h a public header
	since Headers/X11/Xlib.h includes it. Install wish8.4 script
	that runs "Wish Shell.app" and corresponding wish link.
	Use tcl headers from built Tcl.framework instead of from tcl
	source directory.

	* macosx/tkMacOSXPort.h: added missing standard unix includes 
	and defines, similarly to tkUnixPort.h.
	* macosx/tkMacOSXNotify.c: removed dependency on internal tcl
	header "tclPort.h"

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/install-sh: copied support for 'install-strip' target
	over from tcl/unix/{Makefile.in,install-sh}

2002-09-22  Jim Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* macosx/tkMacOSXScrlbr.c (UpdateControlValue): HiliteControl
	doesn't give the proper "nothing to scroll" look on Mac OS X.
	You have to set the min value greater than the max value to
	get this.

2002-09-15  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl.
	* unix/tkUnixEvent.c (TkpCloseDisplay): Use PEEK_XCLOSEIM
	to examine the input context queue before invoking
	XCloseIM. Generate an assert if there is an input
	context that has not been freed.
	[Patch 570902]

2002-09-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tk.h: Moved RC_INVOKED down so that tcl.h is still
	  included when running the resource compiler. <tcl.h> excludes
	  the unnecessary parts on its own. This reenables the Windows
	  build. It failed because the non-inclusion of tcl.h caused the
	  resource compiler to miss some vital macro definitions
	  (TCL_FINAL_RELEASE, STRINGIFY, ...).

2002-09-12  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tk.h:
	* mac/tkMacApplication.r:
	* mac/tkMacLibrary.r:
	* mac/tkMacResource.r:
	* macosx/tkAboutDlg.r:
	* macosx/tkMacOSXApplication.r:
	* macosx/tkMacOSXLibrary.r:
	* macosx/tkMacOSXResource.r: unified use of the two equivalent 
	resource compiler header inclusion defines RC_INVOKED and
	RESOURCE_INCLUDED, now use RC_INVOKED throughout.

	* macosx/tkMacOSXAppInit.c: improved detection of Wish startup
	by the finder (by checking if stdin is /dev/null), in which
	case we want to bring up the Tk console window.

	* macosx/tkMacOSXHLEvents.c: added 'rapp' apple event handler.

2002-09-12  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj: reference & install
	tk/generic/prolog.ps instead of tk/library/prolog.ps.

2002-09-10  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj: added backwards
	compatibility for OSX 10.1 ProjectBuilder 2.0.

2002-09-10  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: added DYLIB_INSTALL_DIR variable for Darwin
	and set it to default value ${LIB_RUNTIME_DIR}
	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): use DYLIB_INSTALL_DIR instead of
	LIB_RUNTIME_DIR in the -install_name argument to ld.
	* unix/configure: regen.

	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj:
	* macosx/Makefile: added support for building Tcl as an embedded
	framework, i.e. using an dyld install_name containing
	@executable_path/../Frameworks via the new DYLIB_INSTALL_DIR
	unix/Makefile variable.

2002-09-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	*** 8.4.0 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

2002-09-09  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* macosx/tkMacOSXNotify.c (Tk_MacOSXSetupTkNotifier): corrected
	Mac Jaguar event loop issue.

	* library/tk.tcl: use command instead of control on Aqua bindings.
	Force dialogs to appear below fixed native Mac menubar.
	* macosx/tkMacOSXKeyEvent.c:
	* macosx/tkMacOSXKeyboard.c: Keypress/release events for pure
	modifier keys were not being passed to Tk.
	Deadkey presses were inserting null characters into text windows.
	Now they do nothing. (Still not ideal, but better than before!)
	* macosx/tkMacOSXMenu.c: Allow more than 200 menus to exist -
	increased to 2000.
	* macosx/tkMacOSXMouseEvent.c: Bad interactions between floating
	windows and ordinary ones.  Ensure that local<->global coordinate
	transformations are wrt to the correct window.
	* macosx/tkMacOSXWm.c: Better error msg for 'wm attributes'.
	Remove crash in 'wm transient'.
	Add 'noActivates' and 'noUpdates' flags to unsupported command.
	[Patch #606658] (darley)

	* library/xmfbox.tcl (::tk::MotifFDialog_ActivateSEnt): corrected
	msgcat code with XPG specifier. [Patch #606719] (miller)

	* tests/unixWm.test (unixWm-50.3):  Constrained test that hangs
	on Windows.

2002-09-05  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	TK_PATCH_LEVEL version bump to 8.4.0.

2002-09-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/Makefile.in (install-libraries): Added code section to
	  install the message catalogs. Copied same section from
	  unix/Makefile.in and adapted it to the slightly different
	  environment.

2002-09-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/button.tcl: further restrict buttons to not resetting
	the "original" relief if it has changed in the interim.  This
	prevents code that simulated overrelief buttons from not working
	in 8.4.  [Bug #604270]

2002-09-03  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Wish.pbproj/project.pbxproj: Bumped version number to
	8.4.0 and updated copyright info.

2002-09-03  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

2002-09-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/cursor.test: reverted 2002-08-31 change for OS X to use
	'heart' cursor because 'arrow' on windows has a pre-skewed use
	count. [Bug #602667]

	* tests/button.test: added button-14.1
	* win/tkWinButton.c (TkpComputeButtonGeometry): correct Win button
	sizing to be equal for one-line buttons with -height of 0 or 1, as
	well as -height 0 buttons with empty text and no image, which
	should be the same as single-line text buttons. [Bug #565485]

	* library/button.tcl (::tk::ButtonLeave): correctly restore state
	of button to normal for unix bindings. [Bug #597920]

	* doc/tk.n: added tk windowingsystem docs.

	* tests/wm.test:
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c: remove possible 2-second delay in 'raise'.
	[Patch #601518] (english) TIP #107

	* unix/tcl.m4: add support for 64-bit builds on HP-11 with gcc.
	* unix/configure.in: make sure to substitute LD_LIBRARY_PATH_VAR.
	* unix/configure: regend

	* README:		Bumped version number to 8.4.0

	but only the caret and windowingsystem subcommands may be called.
	* tests/safe.test (safe-1.2): noted that tk is now available in
	safe interps, but not the appname/scaling subcommands.

	* tests/tk.test (tk-1.2): noted new tk windowingsystem subcommand

2002-08-31  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4: update from Tcl

	* unix/Makefile.in: import of TK_SHLIB_LD_EXTRAS for Tk library
	specific linker settings. Added use of new LD_LIBRARY_PATH_VAR.

	* unix/configure: regen

2002-08-31  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	*** macosx-8-4-branch merged into the mainline [tcl patch #602770] ***

	* generic/tk.decls:
	* generic/tkInt.decls: added new "aqua" specific entries to the
	stubs tables. Changed all "unix" entries to "x11" to allow us to
	distinguish and build both "aqua" on MacOSX and "x11" on MacOSX.

	* generic/tk.h: added a #ifnded RESOURCE_INCLUDED so that tk.h can
	be passed to the resource compiler. 
	
	* generic/tkCmds.c (Tk_TkObjCmd): added [tk windowingsystem]
	subcommand: returns "x11" when running on X11, "win32" on Windows,
	"classic" on MacOS9 and "aqua" on MacOSX Aqua (i.e. Carbon)

	* generic/tkFont.c (TkFontGetFirstTextLayout): new private function
	returning the first chunk of a Tk_TextLayout, i.e. until the first
	font change on the first line (or the whole first line if there is
	no such font change).

	* generic/tkMain.c: made Tcl_ThreadDataKey static

	* library/demos/puzzle.tcl: fixed button metrics for aqua

	* tests/cursor.test: check for presence of arrow cursor instead of
	heart cursor

	added to the auto_path. This allows tk apps to embed scripts within
	their bundle directory structure.

	* macosx/tkMacOSXInit.c (new): macosx adapted version of
	tkUnixInit.c: we initialize & cache the Carbon native encoding
	(e.g. 'macRoman') and try to find the tk script library files

	* doc/radiobutton.n:      that when -offrelief is flat and -relief is
	* mac/tkMacButton.c:      sunken and -overrelief is raised, buttons
	* unix/tkUnixButton.c:    work look toolbar buttons under Windows.
	* win/tkWinButton.c:      See also: TIP #82.

2002-08-26  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* win/Makefile.in:	Removed dependence on the (parts of) the
	* win/winMain.c:	tcltest executable on Windows.  It was not
	used, and the dependency complicated the Makefile.  [Bug 592638].

2002-08-20  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* README:		Bumped version number to 8.4b3 to distinguish
	* generic/tk.h:		HEAD from the 8.4b2 release.
	* unix/configure.in:
	* win/configure.in:
	* unix/tk.spec:
	
	* unix/configure:	autoconf
	* win/configure:

	* generic/tk.h:	Added compile-time check that the tcl.h header file
	#included by Tk 8.4 is one from Tcl 8.4.  This is needed to be sure
	that new #defines like CONST84 are available. [Bug 597432].

2002-08-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in (install-binaries): simplified pkgIndex.tcl
	file created on installation.
	* win/Makefile.in (install-binaries): corrected and simplified
	creation of pkgIndex.tcl file on installation.

2002-08-14  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c:
	* win/makefile.vc: broken compilation and link from changes
	Hobbs-08-07 fixed.
	* win/tkWinTest.c: CONST problem resolved.

2002-08-13  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/button.tcl: change the bindings to use Priv($w,relief)
	instead of just Priv(relief).  This ensures that neighboring
	buttons don't confuse (over)relief settings.

2002-08-13  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/tkUnixSend.c (Tk_SetAppName): Fixed a compiler warning.

2002-08-12  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/demos/image2.tcl: Tweaked the behaviour of the directory
	box on resize, as resizing of the overall window tends to be
	common given the sample images.

2002-08-08  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (WmTransientCmd): Apply fix for
	wm transient assertion error that was applied
	to tkWinWm.c for Tk Bug #592201.

2002-08-08  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/wm.test: Add deleteWindows at start of
	new transient tests so they do not fail if the
	toplevels already exist.
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c: Revert patch for Tk Bug #592201
	which incorrectly removed numTransients member.

2002-08-08  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c:
	* win/tkWinWm.c:
	* tests/wm.test: Fix for Tk Bug #592201 "wm transient fails with two
	  masters"; fixes panic after a transient window is reassigned to
	  new master and either master is subsequently destroyed.

2002-08-08  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* tests/unixWm.test:  Corrected packaging of unixWm-50.3 so that
	[setupbg] and [cleanupbg] always balance, no matter what tests
	are skipped.

2002-08-08  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Fixed typos in DISTNAME, and ZIPNAME.

2002-08-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	*** 8.4b2 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* generic/tkButton.c (TkButtonWorldChanged): added GCFont handling
	to the disabledGc of buttons when compound != none.  The drawing
	appears to be incorrect across platforms still.  [Bug #477740]

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c (FileReadGIF): fixed -from handling for gifs
	[Bug #467524] (obermeier)

2002-08-07  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkCanvUtil.c (TkSmoothParseProc): recognize the built-in
	bezier method by name. [Bug #578654]
	* doc/canvas.n: update to note that -smooth really doesn't take
	or return just booleans.

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (TkpSetWindowMenuBar): fixed logic bug in when
	to idle call ReconfigureWindowsMenu.

	* doc/GetBitmap.3: removed doc refs to deprecated
	Tk_GetBitmapFromData. [Bug #590379]

	* generic/tkPanedWindow.c (Tk_PanedWindowObjCmd): 
	* library/panedwindow.tcl: changed class from PanedWindow to
	Panedwindow to not conflict with existing bwidgets, but also to be
	more regular with other names used in the core.

	* tests/panedwindow.test: added -text foobar to some test buttons
	to enable correct testing of panedwindow across platforms.
	[Bug #582370]

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: enabled use of the updated native Windows
	directory browser (tk_chooseDirectory).  This does require
	shell32.dll v4.71 or greater. [Patch #468139]

	* win/configure:
	* win/tcl.m4: added shell32 to libs for updated native Windows
	tk_chooseDirectory dialog.

2002-08-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tkPanedWindow.c (RESIZE_PENDING): Separated out flag for
	indicating that a resize needs to be issued.
	(PanedWindowReqProc): Do the old behaviour when the panedwindow is
	not mapped; easiest way of making the test suite pass while still
	preserving improved behaviour in the face of children whose size
	is not known immediately.

2002-08-06  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* tests/defs.tcl: removed file.  No longer needed now that Tk is 
	using the tcltest package to do its testing.

2002-08-05  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* win/tkWinFont.c:	Additional changes to fix CONST warnings on
	* win/tkWinWM.c:	Windows due to latest patch.  Tks Vince Darley.

	* doc/3DBorder.3:	Applied companion patch for Tcl Patch 585105,
	* doc/BindTable.3:	updating Tk to use Tcl 8.4's fully CONST-ified
	* doc/ConfigWidg.3:	interface, and fully CONSTifying Tk at the
	* doc/CrtImgType.3:	same time.
	* doc/CrtWindow.3:
	* doc/DeleteImg.3:	This patch includes purging Tk of its last
	* doc/FindPhoto.3:	direct access to interp->result.  [Bug 589853]
	* doc/GetAnchor.3:
	* doc/GetBitmap.3:	The substantial changes include copying
	* doc/GetCapStyl.3:	event sequence strings into Tcl_DStrings
	* doc/GetClrmap.3:	in tkBind.c, and copying [text] indices into
	* doc/GetColor.3:	Tcl_DStrings because parsing them involved
	* doc/GetCursor.3:	overwriting them.  If this causes performance
	* doc/GetFont.3:	trouble, that can be resolved by further
	* doc/GetImage.3:	converting them to Tcl_Obj's.
	* doc/GetJoinStl.3:
	* doc/GetJustify.3:	The #defines USE_NON_CONST and USE_COMPAT_CONST

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl.

2002-07-29  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Remove code that was setting
	CC_SEARCH_FLAGS and LD_SEARCH_FLAGS to try to
	account for cc vs ld linking. Tcl now handles this.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl.

2002-07-27  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Add MAJOR_VERSION, MINOR_VERSION,
	PATCH_LEVEL, INSTALL_LIBRARY, STUB_LIB_FILE, and LIB_FILE
	to support changes in tcl.m4 related to library builds.
	Use MAKE_LIB macro to avoid dealing with RANLIB issues.
	Rename TK_CC_SEARCH_FLAGS to CC_SEARCH_FLAGS and
	rename TK_LD_SEARCH_FLAGS to LD_SEARCH_FLAGS.
	Use new INSTALL_LIB and INSTALL_STUB_LIB substs to
	deal with ranlib issues when install libraries.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Remove AC_PROG_RANLIB since
	this is done by tcl.m4 now. Define CC_SEARCH_FLAGS
	instead of TK_CC_SEARCH_FLAGS and so on.
	Use MAKE_LIB and MAKE_STUB_LIB from tcl.m4.
	Remove AC_SUBST calls that are no done in tcl.m4.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl.
	* unix/tkConfig.sh.in: Subst CC_SEARCH_FLAGS and
	LD_SEARCH_FLAGS.

	* generic/tkInt.h:
	* generic/tkWindow.c:
	* mac/tkMacWm.c:
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c:
	* win/tkWinWm.c:
	* tests/wm.test:
	* tests/winWm.test:
	* tests/unixWm.test: Objectifed wm. [Patch #564521]
	Note: At this point the Mac file is completely untested
	and may not even compile.

2002-07-25  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/spinbox.test: added spinbox-22.[1-3]
	* generic/tkEntry.c (ConfigureEntry): made the textvariable value
	take precedence over changed -from/-to values, unless it must be
	constrained.  [Bug #559078]

	* library/spinbox.tcl (MouseSelect): when not in the entry, just
	return instead of invoking - ButtonUp handles invoking already.
	[Bug #499168]

	* library/tk.tcl (RestoreFocusGrab): handle the case where the
	FocusGrab info is not set. [Bug #553283]

2002-07-24  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/canvas.test: added canvas-14.[1-6]
	* generic/tkCanvas.c (CanvasWidgetCmd): corrected handling of
	'scan' subcommand args.  Also removed early return cases to goto
	done instead where the canvasPtr would be Tcl_Release'd.  This may
	solve other problems with unreleased canvasPtr's. [Bug #581560]

	* win/tkWinButton.c (TkpDisplayButton): corrected display of focus
	ring around the actual text when the button is a compound button.
	[Bug #583691]

	* unix/README: Corrected notes about running user interactive Tk
	tests. [Bug #462320]

	* generic/tkText.c (TextEditUndo): set isDirtyIncrement to -1 when
	reverting to note proper "dirtiness". [Bug #580362] (callewaert)

	* generic/tkEntry.c (DisplayEntry): correct cursor position before
	calling Tk_SetCaretPos. (yamamoto)

2002-07-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl.

2002-07-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/choosedir.tcl (tk::dialog::file::chooseDir):
	* library/clrpick.tcl (tk::dialog::file::chooseDir):
	* library/msgbox.tcl (tk::MessageBox):
	* library/tkfbox.tcl (tk::dialog::file):
	* library/xmfbox.tcl (tk::MotifFDialog):
	Revert [Tk patch 568278]. The transient window workaround
	is no longer needed since the fix for [Tk bug 570764]
	solved the problem for withdrawn transients.

2002-07-19  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in: Add AC_PREREQ(2.13) in an attempt
	to make it more clear that the configure scripts
	must be generated with autoconf version 2.13.
	[Tcl Bug 583573]

2002-07-19  D. Richard Hipp  <drh@hwaci.com>

	* library/mkpsec.tcl: Fix a bug that was causing postscript generation
	to fail under Win2K.

2002-07-18  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/tkUnixSend.c: Using Tcl_GetTime instead of TclpGetTime.

2002-07-17  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* library/unsupported.tcl: Extended ExposePrivateVariable, and
	ExposePrivateCommand to accept patterns as well.	

2002-07-17  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tkFont.c: Corrected reversed logic in assert -> panic
	conversion.  [Bug 582799]

2002-07-16  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkFont.c (TkFontPkgFree): Call panic instead
	of assert since assert is not used in the rest of Tk.
	[Tk bug 579651]

2002-07-16  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in: Add a more descriptive warning
	in the event `make genstubs` needs to be rerun.

2002-07-16  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tkWinWm.c: 
	* doc/wm.n: fix for part of [Bug 581627], and made iconbitmap
	code on Windows more flexible about reading in icons [Bug
	220800].

2002-07-15  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.bc (new): re-add of the borland makefile.  Submitted
	by Helmut Giese <hgiese@ratiosoft.com>.  This needs testing, still.

2002-07-15  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* Fixes for [Bug 581627, 581795].
	* generic/tkTest.c:		Test commands not supported on non-Unix
	  platforms should not be defined there in the first place.
	* tests/constraints.tcl:	Fixed "secureserver" constraint.
	* tests/unixWm.test:		Some tests needed "unix" constraint.
	* win/tkWinWm.c:		Typo in error message.

2002-07-14  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* tests/event.test:	Fixes to enable testing of only userInteraction
	* tests/visual_bb.test:	tests.

	* README:		Bumped HEAD to version 8.4b2 in order to 
	* generic/tk.h:		distinguish it from the 8.4b1 release.
	* unix/configure*:	Also extended LOCALES to cover all message
	* unix/tk.spec:		catalogs.
	* win/configure*:

	* tests/focustTcl.test:	Conversion bug: Corrected backwards logic.
	* tests/imgPhoto.test:	Conversion bug: overwrote unix/README.

	* tests/all.tcl:		Completed conversion of Tk test suite
	* tests/constraints.tcl:	to use tcltest.
	* tests/[b-v]*.test:
	* unix/Makefile.in:

2002-07-12  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* tests/constraints.tcl:	Converted more files to tcltest and
	* tests/[g-x]*.test:		factored out common code.

2002-07-11  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* tests/canvPsImg.tcl:			Converted several files in the
	* tests/constraints.tcl (new file):	Tk test suite for testing by
	* tests/[r-x]*.test:			tcltest 2.1.
	* unix/Makefile.in:

2002-07-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c (Tk_ChooseDirectoryObjCmd): initialize
	utfTitle to NULL, add a few more notes about limitations of
	possible new Tk_ChooseDirectoryObjCmd function.

2002-07-11  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/imgPhoto.test (imgPhoto-15.1): Added test of mem-alloc
	failure, but this is non-portable.
	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (ImgPhotoSetSize): Allowed this function to
	fail when it can't allocate enough memory.  Note that not all the
	places that call it can fail nicely without API changes; some
	still panic but at least some of the potential failures are now
	handled gracefully.

	* tests/visual_bb.test (lpr): Stopped this from relying on
	external files; direct piping is much more flexible for this
	application.

2002-07-09  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tkTest.c:	Removed unused dependence on TclThread_Init()
	* tests/defs.tcl:	and [testthread].  [Bug 578165, Tcl Bug 531413]

2002-07-08  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Added missing win/lamp.bmp to the dist
	target.

2002-07-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	*** 8.4b1 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

2002-07-04  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/bgerror.tcl (bgerror): Stopped the bgerror dialog from
	getting wider than the screen; in theory really long messages
	could make it become taller than the screen now, but that's much
	less likely to happen.  Also trimmed a little bit of internal
	space so that the icon-message gap is the same as the icon-frame
	and message-frame gaps.

2002-07-01  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: Updated to latest tcl.m4 from Tcl.

2002-06-28  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/msgbox.tcl (MessageBox): Force all non-button widgets to
	have the same background as the containing toplevel.  [Bug #552515]

2002-06-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/Makefile.in (install-binaries): Fix of troubled Makefile
	quoting introduced by [Patch 521356] causing the installed to
	fail.

2002-06-25  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c: (Tk_DrawChars) silence compiler warning.

2002-06-26  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tkStyle.c: <eol> of the committing cvs client didn't
	match the <eol> of the file itself.  Windows users where getting
	\r\r\n.  Problem fixed.

2002-06-26  Anton Kovalenko <a_kovalenko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkFont.c (TkTextLayoutToPostscript): fixed potential
	buffer overflow which could be intentionally triggered from
	within safe interpreter -- malicious applet could modify 
	tk::psglyphs array.

2002-06-26  Anton Kovalenko <a_kovalenko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/font.test (font-32.1): updated this test
	to expect the new behavior of canvas postscript.

2002-06-25  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:	Expanded install-binaries target to create
	* win/Makefile.in:	and install a pkgIndex.tcl file to enable
	Tk as a loadable package [Patch 521356]

2002-06-25  Anton Kovalenko <a_kovalenko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/mkpsenc.tcl: (added) utilities to generate
	Postscript prolog for current system encoding.
	* generic/tkCanvPs.c (TkCanvPostscriptCmd): now
	uses mkpsenc.tcl to generate Postscript prolog.
	* generic/tkFont.c (TkTextLayoutToPostscript): modified
	according to patch #546910. Now outputs system-encoded
	characters (for unibyte) or Adobe glyph names (for
	multibyte or outside-locale).
	* tests/canvText.test (canvText-17.1): updated this test
	to expect the new behavior of canvas postscript.

2002-06-25  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/tcl.m4:       New macro SC_CONFIG_MANPAGES.
	* unix/configure.in: Added support for symlinks and compression
	* unix/Makefile.in:  when installing the manpages. [Patch 518052]
	                     Default is still hardlinks and no compression.

	* unix/mkLinks:      generated
	* unix/configure:

	* unix/README:       Added documentation for the new features.

	* unix/configure:                  Replaced ${exec_prefix}/lib
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_PATH_TCLCONFIG): by ${libdir}.

2002-06-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/winWm.test: Verify that both an unmapped
	and already mapped toplevel are raised and receive
	the focus when deiconified.
	* tests/wm.test: Add wm deiconify tests. Check that
	a toplevel that has never been mapped is not mapped
	by the deiconify command since it should be done
	at idle by MapFrame.
	* win/tkWinWm.c (Tk_WmCmd): Check the WM_NEVER_MAPPED
	flag while processing the wm deiconify command.
	The WM_UPDATE_PENDING flag should never be set when
	WM_NEVER_MAPPED is set, but double check so that
	the implementation is more explicit and matches
	the comment just above.
	Return without invoking TkWmRestackToplevel or
	TkSetFocusWin on a toplevel that has never been
	mapped. This fixes a bug where a toplevel is mapped
	with the wrong size and is then resized by the
	idle call to MapFrame. [Tk bug 233150]

2002-06-23  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c (UpdateGeometryInfo): remove the check for a null
	wrapper introduced in r1.41 on 2002-06-15 because it prevented
	geometry setting from taking effect if the window was not on the
	screen.  Another check may go in it's place as IsIconic and
	IsZoomed should not be passed NULL.

2002-06-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/wm.test: Remove invalid minsize test. Add update
	calls to wm transient tests so that idle handlers get
	run. This is needed to get the tests to pass under Win32.
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (WmWaitMapProc): Move the special
	transient withdrawn check into the if body to
	make it easier to set a breakpoint on this test
	inside a debugger. No functional changes.
	* win/tkWinWm.c (WmWaitVisibilityOrMapProc): Ditto.

2002-06-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/wm.n:                   TIP #95 Windows implementation and
	* mac/tkMacWm.c (Tk_WmCmd):   docs with mac and unix stubs.
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (Tk_WmCmd):
	* win/tkWinWm.c (Tk_WmCmd):
	* tests/unixWm.test:
	* tests/winWm.test: more wm attr tests will be needed.

	* generic/tkGrid.c (GridReqProc): check that gridPtr is not NULL
	(may be when embedded). [Bug #548791] (halliday)

	* generic/tkFont.c (TkFontPkgFree): changed panic on freeing fonts
	to an assert, and wrapped panic in #ifdef PURIFY. [Bug #568701]

	* library/menu.tcl: corrected menus from being posted offscreen
	on Windows. [Bug #464451] (darley)

	* library/console.tcl: corrected the defaultPrompt substitution
	[Bug #553207] and made Tab a default expansion key (like Escape).

	* win/tkWinEmbed.c (EmbedWindowDeleted): added a check for a null
	containerPtr.  The core of this bug is likely elsewhere. [Bug #476176]

	* doc/text.n:                             TIP #93 implementation that
	* generic/tkText.c (TextWidgetCmd):       enhances the text get and
	* generic/tkTextIndex.c (TkTextGetIndex): delete methods to accept
	* tests/text.test:                        multiple range pairs.
	This handles the delete case in an atomic, fixed-index fashion.

2002-06-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/wm.test: Add tests to make sure a withdrawn
	transient does not get remapped by state changes
	in the master.
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (Tk_WmCmd, WmWaitMapProc):
	* win/tkWinWm.c (Tk_WmCmd, WmWaitVisibilityOrMapProc):
	Add a WM_TRANSIENT_WITHDRAWN flag that gets set by the
	withdraw, deiconify, or state wm subcommands. Check
	this flag before mapping a transient when processing
	a MapNotify event. [Tk bug 570764]

2002-06-21  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tk.spec (version), README, win/configure.in, unix/configure.in: 
	* generic/tk.h (TK_RELEASE_*, TK_PATCH_LEVEL): Bumped to beta1.

2002-06-21  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/text.n:          TIP #104 implementation which generalizes the
	* generic/tkText.c:    undo/redo stack to not be tied solely to the
	* generic/tkText.h:    text widget.  The APIs are still private.
	* generic/tkUndo.c:    This also adds a stack limiting ability and
	* generic/tkUndo.h:    a -maxundo option to the text widget (in
	* library/text.tcl:    addition to the options from TIP #26) should
	* mac/tkMacDefault.h:  users want to limit the undo/redo stack
	* tests/text.test:     (should not be necessary in most cases).
	* unix/Makefile.in:    [Patch #554763] (callewart)
	* unix/tkUnixDefault.h:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/tkWinDefault.h:

2002-06-21  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:	Removed unnecessary dependence of tktest
	* unix/tkAppInit.c:	executable on the tcltest executable on
	Unix.  If there are similar dependencies on other platforms, they
	can probably be removed as well.  [Bug 572134].

2002-06-20  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/listbox.n:
	* generic/tkListbox.c (DisplayListbox): 
	* mac/tkMacDefault.h:   TIP #94 implementation adding -activestyle
	* tests/listbox.test:   option to the listbox.  This adds the ability 
	* unix/tkUnixDefault.h: to have listboxes look native on Windows, and
	* win/tkWinDefault.h:   "nicer" elsewhere using the 'dotbox' style.

2002-06-20  Peter Spjuth  <peter.spjuth@space.se>

	* generic/tkGrid.c: Corrected the test for grid propagate change.
	[Bug #571433]

2002-06-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/panedwindow.test:
	* generic/tkPanedWindow.c: ensure that sash index is lower bounds
	checked. [Bug #548727]

2002-06-19  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkClipboard.c (TkClipCleanup): Add code
	to set dispPtr->clipWindow to NULL, this was
	accidently removed by last commit. Fixes
	a crash while running the tests under win32.

2002-06-19  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkBind.c (TkBindDeadWindow):
	Handle case where Tk_DestroyWindow is invoked
	on clipboard and send windows.
	* generic/tkClipboard.c (TkClipCleanup):
	Invoke Tk_DestroyWindow to cleanup the
	dispPtr->clipWindow. Call Tcl_Preserve
	and Tcl_Release on the window to avoid an
	invalid memory ref on shutdown.
	* generic/tkEvent.c (Tk_HandleEvent):
	Panic if XCreateIC is invoked twice for
	the same window. This should never happen,
	the check were just added to make sure it
	does not since this could lead to crashes
	in XCloseIM.
	* generic/tkFocus.c (TkFocusDeadWindow):
	Handle case where Tk_DestroyWindow is invoked
	on clipboard and send windows.
	* generic/tkOption.c (TkOptionDeadWindow): Ditto.
	* generic/tkWindow.c (TkCloseDisplay): Move
	deletion of dispPtr->winTable after TkpCloseDisplay
	call since Tk_DestroyWindow uses it and could
	be called by TkpCloseDisplay for clipboard/send windows.
	Also invoke ckfree for the dispPtr instead of
	doing it in TkpCloseDisplay.
	(Tk_DestroyWindow): Check for a null winPtr->mainPtr
	before doing certain cleanup tasks so the we can
	invoke Tk_DestroyWindow on clipboard and send windows.
	We need to do this so that XDestroyIC will get invoked
	for the input contexts of each window.
	* mac/tkMacXStubs.c (TkpCloseDisplay): Don't free
	the displayPtr since this is now done in TkCloseDisplay.
	* unix/tkUnixEvent.c (TkpCloseDisplay, OpenIM): Remove
	conditional compilation around calls to XCloseIM
	since I am confident that the crashes related to
	input contexts has been fixed. Don't free
	the displayPtr since this is now done in TkCloseDisplay.
	* unix/tkUnixSend.c (TkSendCleanup): Invoke the
	Tk_DestroyWindow method to cleanup the special
	send window. This will call XDestroyIC and thereby
	avoid a crash in XCloseIM. The send window needs
	to be Tcl_Preserve and Tcl_Release to avoid an
	invalid memory ref on shutdown.
	* win/tkWinX.c (TkpCloseDisplay): Don't free
	the displayPtr since this is now done in TkCloseDisplay.
	[Tk patch 570902]

2002-06-19  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tkStyle.c: TIP#48 style engine.
	See http://purl.org/tcl/tip/48.html for details.

	* generic/tkConfig.c (GetOptionFromObj): Split to allow for access
	to option tables via name as well as via object.
	(TkGetOptionSpec): Semi-public interface to GetOption functionality.
	(DoObjConfig, Tk_RestoreSavedOptions, FreeResources)
	(GetObjectForOption): Basic style support for configure.

	* generic/tkWindow.c (TkCreateMainWindow, Tk_DestroyWindow): Added
	calls to set up and tear down the style subsystem.

	* generic/tk.decls, generic/tk.h: Many declarations forming TIP#48
	public interface.

	* generic/tkInt.decls (TkStylePkgInit,TkStylePkgFree): 
	* generic/tkInt.h (TkGetOptionSpec): Supporting declarations.

	* unix/Makefile.in, win/Makefile.in, win/makefile.vc: Added
	tkStyle.c to list of generic source files.

2002-06-18  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/defs.tcl (makeFile): Defined the return value of this
	procedure to be the filename of the created file, as in the real
	tcltest package...

2002-06-17  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkImage.c (Tk_ImageObjCmd, DeleteImage): Call
	Tcl_Preserve and Tcl_Release for the masterPtr->winPtr
	window to avoid accessing memory that had already
	been deallocated in DeleteImage.

2002-06-17  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	Trims to support the removal of RESOURCE_INCLUDED from rc
	scripts from Tcl's accepted FR #565088.

	* generic/tk.h: Changed RESOURCE_INCLUDED to be RC_INVOKED
	as the RC tool defines this already by default.

	* win/rc/tk.rc:
	* win/rc/wish.rc: removed the #define RESOURCE_INCLUDED lines.

2002-06-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in (dist): correct installation of
	wish.exe.manifest to DISTDIR target directory.

	* unix/tkUnixKey.c (TkpGetString, Tk_SetCaretPos): 
	* win/tkWinX.c (Tk_SetCaretPos): 
	* tests/tk.test:        Added 'tk caret' implementation of TIP#96
	* doc/SetCaret.3 (new): which adds a TkCaret structure element to
	* doc/tk.n:             TkDisplay for maintaining state.

	* unix/tkUnixSend.c (TkSendCleanup): special cleanup of
	inputContext to avoid bug in XCloseIM. (dejong)

2002-06-17  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* library/msgs/en_gb.msg:  Added catalog for UK English.
	Currently includes only Color -> Colour translation.

2002-06-17  D. Richard Hipp  <drh@hwaci.com>

2002-06-14  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Tk_DestroyWindow): Set the pathName
	component of a window to NULL after its memory has been
	deallocated to avoid a possible illegal memory access
	as a result of a call to Tk_PathName() on a Tk_Window
	structure of a window that has already been destroyed.
	[Tk bug 521946]

2002-06-14  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkOption.c (Tk_GetOption): Allocate
	memory with ckalloc not malloc. This keeps
	Tk from erroring out when built with
	TCL_MEM_DEBUG.

2002-06-14  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkBind.c (HandleEventGenerate): 
	* generic/tkInt.h: changed warpInProgress boolean from int to a
	bit in the flags variable (TK_DISPLAY_IN_WARP)

	* generic/tkCmds.c (Tk_TkObjCmd): 
	* unix/tkUnixKey.c (TkpGetString): 
	* generic/tkEvent.c (Tk_HandleEvent):

	* generic/tkCmds.c (Tk_WmObjCmd): 
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (Tk_WmCmd): 
	* win/tkWinWm.c (Tk_WmCmd): changed wmTracing from being an int to
	just a bit in the flags variable (TK_DISPLAY_WM_TRACING)

	* generic/tkEvent.c (Tk_HandleEvent): 
	* unix/tkUnixEvent.c (OpenIM): 
	* unix/tkUnixKey.c (TkpGetString): 
	* generic/tkInt.h: added TK_DISPLAY_XIM_SPOT flag bit for TkDisplay
	and used this to allow a runtime check to see if over-the-spot XIM
	is possible.  If not it will try and fallback to the old-style
	input context, which handles things like dead keys input.

	* generic/tk.decls:     added TIP #84 implementation that adds a
	* generic/tkDecls.h:    Tk_CollapseMotionEvents API which controls
	* generic/tkEvent.c:    Tk's collapsing of incoming motion events
	* generic/tkInt.h:      on its windows.  The default remains to do
	* generic/tkStubInit.c: collapsing.  Added a flags parameter to the
	* generic/tkWindow.c:   internal display structure to support this
	* doc/QWinEvent.3:      and be used in the future for other bits.
	                        [Tk patch 564642]

	* unix/mkLinks: updated from current docs

2002-06-14  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkEvent.c (TkXErrorHandler): Declare static
	function to avoid compiler error with VC++.
	* generic/tkBind.c (ExpandPercents): Cast argument to

2002-06-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tkAppInit.c: Removed now unneeded and erroneous reference
	  to 'matherr'. See Tcl ChangeLog entry 2002-05-31 Don Porter.

2002-06-14  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/rules.vc: The test for compiler optimizations was in error.
	Thanks goes to Roy Terry <royterry@earthlink.net> for his
	assistance with this.

2002-06-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	Implement TIP 98  [Tk patch 566765]
	
	* doc/FindPhoto.3, generic/tk.h, generic/tk.decls:
	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c: Changed *_Old to *_NoComposite and
	USE_OLD_PHOTO_PUT_BLOCK to USE_COMPOSITELESS_PHOTO_PUT_BLOCK
	following a suggestion from Don Porter. 

	* tests/imgPhoto.test: Added tests of -compositingrule

	* doc/photo.n: Added documentation for "-compositingrule".
	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (ImgPhotoCmd, ParseSubcommandOptions): New
	"-compositingrule" option for [$photo copy] subcommand, using
	OPT_COMPOSITE flag and compositingRule field in SubcommandOptions
	structure.

	* doc/FindPhoto.3: Documented the extra argument for the
	compositing rule and the action to take if anyone wants to
	maintain total backward-compatability.

	* generic/tk.h (TK_PHOTO_COMPOSITE_*): Defined values for use as
	compositing rules. 
	(USE_OLD_PHOTO_PUT_BLOCK): Added a way for users to select the old
	interface to Tk_PhotoPutBlock to provide an easier upgrade path.

	* generic/tk.decls: Alter Tk_PhotoPut*Block to Tk_PhotoPut*Block_Old
	and introduce new slots for the old name of function with an extra
	argument at the end for the compositing rule.

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (ImgPhotoCmd): Updated "transparency set"
	subcommand to use TkSubtractRegion().

	* win/tkWinRegion.c (TkSubtractRegion): 
	* mac/tkMacRegion.c (TkSubtractRegion): 
	* generic/tkInt.decls (TkSubtractRegion): 
	* unix/tkUnixPort.h (TkSubtractRegion): Added function to perform
	the set-difference operation on regions; it seems all platforms
	can support it, and it makes removing rectangular bits from
	regions much easier.

	* generic/tkImgPPM.c (FileReadPPM): Reading a PPM/PGM always uses
	the SET compositing rule because it is faster and the format does
	not have any transparency information.

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c (FileReadGIF): Reading a GIF always uses the
	SET compositing rule because GIF files model transparency as a
	single special colour.

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (Tk_PhotoPutBlock, Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock):
	Added a compositing rule to allow better control over what happens
	to transparent pixels when inserting data into a photo image.

2002-06-13  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/winfo.test: Add basic tests for winfo ismapped.

2002-06-13  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixWm.test:
	* tests/wm.test: Move wm minsize and wm maxsize
	usage tests into the cross platform wm tests.

2002-06-13  Don Porter <dgp@users.sf.net>

	* tests/cursor.test:  corrected error after cursor-2.2.
	* tests/defs.tcl: Added enhancements to Tk's fake version of
	tcltest required by recent cursor.test changes.

2002-06-13  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/cursor.test (cursor-2.[34]): Tests added to ensure that
	cursor specs really are well-behaved lists.  Also some general
	clean-up...
	* win/tkWinCursor.c (TkGetCursorByName): Undone Jeff's back-off
	and fixed things so that they should work now.  Cursor specs are
	lists first and foremost.

2002-06-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes: Clearly label wm transient changes as
	a POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY. 
	* doc/wm.n: Remove "some window managers will" text
	and explicitly state what behavior a transient
	window will display. Also mention that it is an
	error to make a window a transient of itself.

2002-06-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/clrpick.tcl (tk::dialog::file::chooseDir):
	* library/msgbox.tcl (tk::MessageBox):
	* library/tkfbox.tcl (tk::dialog::file):
	* library/xmfbox.tcl (tk::MotifFDialog): Remove the
	transient property on dialogs after they have been
	dismissed to insulate them from further state changes
	in the master. This keeps a withdrawn dialog from
	being mapped when the master is deiconified. [Tk patch 568278]

2002-06-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tkWinCursor.c (TkGetCursorByName): reverted fix from
	2002-06-06 because it broke the ability to use built-in cursors
	like left_ptr.

2002-06-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/msgbox.tcl (tk::MessageBox):
	* library/tkfbox.tcl (tk::dialog::file):

	Only make the dialog window a transient if
	the master is visible. This check already
	appeared in some of the dialogs. This patch
	just copies the check into those that were
	lacking. [Tk patch 568253]

2002-06-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes: Add note about new transient behavior.
	* tests/unixWm.test: Check that the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR
	property for a transient window is being cleared
	when the master is destroyed.
	* tests/wm.test: Source defs.tcl instead of using
	tcltest to match the rest of Tk's test files.
	Add new tests that ensure that a transient's state
	mirrors the state of the master.
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (WmInfo, TkWmNewWindow, TkWmMapWindow,
	TkWmDeadWindow, Tk_WmCmd, WmWaitMapProc): Add numTransients
	member to WmInfo structure. Keep state of master and
	transient in sync using a callback that tracks MapNotify
	and UnmapNotify events. When the master is mapped, map
	the transient. When the master is unmapped or iconified,
	withdraw the transient.
	* win/tkWinWm.c (TkWmMapWindow, TkpWmSetState,
	TkWmDeadWindow, Tk_WmCmd, WmWaitVisibilityOrMapProc):
	Keep state of master and transient in sync using a
	callback that tracks MapNotify and UnmapNotify events.
	Move masterPtr check from TkpWmSetState into TkWmMapWindow
	to deal with WM_NEVER_MAPPED transients. Cleanup
	numTransients and the callback in TkWmDeadWindow.
	Cleanup numTransients and the callback only after
	deleting a master in wm transient command to avoid
	deleting the callback when an error is raised.
	Add support for MapNotify and UnmapNotify events
	to the master callback. [Tk patch 561708]

2002-06-11  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sf.net>

	* library/menu.tcl: fix for bug report #530212 "Bad Window Path 
	  Name in tkMenuFind"

2002-06-10  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Fixed a win98 issue where the /exclude option
	for xcopy is unsupported.
	Reported by Roy Terry <royterry@earthlink.net>.

2002-06-10  Anton Kovalenko <a_kovalenko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tk.tcl: added utility functions to get "-underline" and 
	"-text" for labels and buttons from translatable string containing 
	"magic ampersand" [patch #566605]
	* library/clrpick.tcl:
	* library/msgbox.tcl:
	* library/tkfbox.tcl:
	* library/xmfbox.tcl: some places where msgcat is used to get
	translated label are modified to handle labels with magic ampersand.
	* library/msgs/ru.msg: russian translations added
	* library/msgs/cs.msg:
	* library/msgs/de.msg:
	* library/msgs/el.msg: 
	* library/msgs/es.msg:
	* library/msgs/fr.msg:
	* library/msgs/it.msg:
	* library/msgs/nl.msg: all translation files now have labels with
	'magic ampersand' where appropriate. In el.msg some ampersands are
	missing, as I don't know which underline positions seems natural
	to "el" users.

2002-06-09  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/bgerror.tcl (tk::dialog::error::bgerror):
	Don't set the bgerror dialog as a transient of
	itself since this operation is ill defined.

2002-06-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* win/tkWinCursor.c (TkGetCursorByName): Fixed so that the reading
	of cursors from a file with a cursor spec was built using [list]
	works when the file has a space in instead of requiring fiddling
	with backslashes.

2002-06-06  Anton Kovalenko <a_kovalenko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/msgbox.tcl (MessageBox): Add -default normal
	when creating non-default buttons for message box.
	They already get -default normal when they're 
	unfocused, and dialog window size used to change suddenly
	in such cases.

2002-06-05  Anton Kovalenko <a_kovalenko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (Tk_DrawChars): Don't assume that
	one char is always one byte, and that required 
	subfont for the last character in any string is 
	the same as for the previous character 
	[Bug #559435] [Patch #559437]

2002-05-27  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes: Document [wm transient .t .t] error.
	* tests/wm.test: Check that setting a window
	as a transient of itself raises an error. Check
	that passing a non-toplevel window to the wm
	transient command uses the enclosing toplevel.
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (Tk_WmCmd): Raise an error
	if the user tries to make a toplevel a
	transient of itself.
	* win/tkWinWm.c (Tk_WmCmd): Raise an error
	if the user tries to make a toplevel a
	transient of itself. Test for other error
	before checking for the transient self error.

2002-05-27  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (WmInfo, TkWmCleanup, TkWmNewWindow,
	TkWmMapWindow, TkWmDeadWindow, Tk_WmCmd): Replace
	WmInfo's master and masterWindowName members with
	a masterPtr member. This implementation is much
	simpler and mirrors the Win32 implementation. This
	change makes it easy to check the flags of the
	master window. No user visible changes.

2002-05-27  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkInt.decls: Add unix decl for TkpWmSetState.
	* generic/tkIntPlatDecls.h: Regen.
	* generic/tkStubInit.c: Regen.
	* tests/wm.test: Test state changes between iconic,
	normal, and withdrawn both before and after initial
	mapping.
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (Tk_WmCmd, TkpWmSetState): Move
	state change code into TkpWmSetState to more closely
	match the Win32 implementation. No user visible changes.

2002-05-27  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/embed.test: Added cross platform embed tests.
	Check that window passed to -use has the -container
	option set.
	* tests/wm.test: Remove useless catch call. Deiconify
	. just in case, stackorder tests will not pass unless
	it is in the normal state. Add -container flag to
	embedded stackorder test.
	* unix/tkUnixEmbed.c (TkpUseWindow):
	* win/tkWinEmbed.c (TkpUseWindow): Lookup Tk window
	based on the id passed in as the value for -use.
	Generate an error if the Tk window did not have
	the -container option set.

2002-05-26  Peter Spjuth <peter.spjuth@space.se>

	* generic/tkButton.c (ConfigureButton): When creating
	a radiobutton with -value "" it was not drawn properly
	if the -variable was created by the radiobutton.
	[Bug #548765]

2002-05-26  Peter Spjuth <peter.spjuth@space.se>

	* generic/tkCanvText.c (ComputeTextBbox): Negative
	coordinates were rounded badly causing a 1 pixel
	displacement. [Bug #556526]
	
2002-05-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tkMacWm.c (Tk_WmCmd):
	* tests/unixWm.test: Move wm transient checks over
	to wm.test so they will be run on all systems.
	* tests/wm.test: Add tests to check for error when
	an iconwindow is passed to the wm transient command.
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (Tk_WmCmd):
	* win/tkWinWm.c (Tk_WmCmd): Raise an error if one
	of the windows passed to the wm transient command
	is an iconwindow for another toplevel.

2002-05-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tkMacWm.c (TkWmStackorderToplevelWrapperMap):
	* tests/wm.test: Add embedded Window test case for
	the stackorder command.
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (TkWmStackorderToplevelWrapperMap):
	* win/tkWinWm.c (TkWmStackorderToplevelWrapperMap):
	Ignore embedded windows during wm stackorder command.

2002-05-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Invoke SC_ENABLE_SHARED before
	calling SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS so that the SHARED_BUILD
	variable can be checked inside SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl.

2002-05-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tk.tcl:  A little namespace cleanup on Daniel Steffen's
	latest revisions to avoid defining new global commands.

2002-05-20  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tkMacInit.c:
	* mac/tkMacTclCode.r: include msgcat package in resources
	as bgerror depends on it. Restores ability of mac static
	build to run standalone (except for encoding file issues).

	* mac/tkMacInit.c:
	* library/console.tcl:
	* library/tk.tcl: fix tk.tcl not sourcing library files
	that define bindings at startup on mac. (independent of
	tk library files being in resources or on auto_path)

2002-05-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/bgerror.tcl:
	* library/tclIndex:  Cleaned up namespace usage of the bgerror
	dialog.  Completes soft dependence on msgcat.  [FR 539309]

2002-05-07  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>
	* win/makefile.vc: Problem with TCLDIR macro not accepting
	forward slash path seperators resolved.  Added the same logic
	to INSTALLDIR, too. [Bug #553208]

2002-04-26  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: change HP-11 SHLIB_LD_LIBS from "" to ${LIBS} so
	that the .sl knows its dependent libs.

2002-04-24  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tkMacTclCode.r:
	* mac/tkMacResource.r: added check of
	TCLTK_NO_LIBRARY_TEXT_RESOURCES #define to allow disabling the
	inclusion of the tk library code in the resource fork of Tk
	executables and shared libraries.
	Moved tk library code inclusion to separate file like in tcl.
	Added 'panedwindow' resource.

2002-04-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/button.tcl (ButtonLeave): corrected the 3
	implementations of ButtonLeave to check for Priv(relief) existing
	before trying to use it. [Patch #541849]

	* generic/tkTextDisp.c (DisplayLineBackground): 
	* unix/tkUnix3d.c (Tk_3DHorizontalBevel): 
	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (Tk_DrawChars): applied fixes to not overrun
	the X window 16-bit size limit. [Patch #541999] (bonfield)

2002-04-22  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tkTextDisp.c (GetXView, GetYView): Comparison with
	previous values of scrollbar range are now done in a way that is
	sensitive to the bizarreness of floating-point on architectures
	where IEEE-FP is not used on the processor.  Also increased the
	size of the temporary buffer to take account of the fact that
	TCL_DOUBLE_SPACE is meant to only imply enough space to take a
	printed double and trailing '\0', and no more.  [Bug #223739]
	(FP_EQUAL_SCALE): New macro to help compare floating-point numbers
	for equality in a sane way, used in GetXView and GetYView.

2002-04-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkWindow.c (TkCloseDisplay): Added to centralize where a
	display was closed.  This handles freeing memory associated with a
	display and closing it.
	(DeleteWindowsExitProc): actually close displays.  This would also
	ideally be done in Tk_DestroyWindow when the last window on the
	display has been closed, but that still has unresolved order of
	cleanup problems.
	(Tk_DestroyWindow): added TkFocusFree call.

	* generic/tkStubInit.c:
	* generic/tkIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tkIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tkInt.decls: added TkFocusFree, TkClipCleanup and
	TkGCCleanup generic private procs, and TkWmCleanup, TkSendCleanup
	and TkFreeXId unix private procs.

	* generic/tkInt.h:
	* unix/tkUnixXId.c (TkFreeXId): frees XID resources.
	Made idCleanupScheduled a Tcl_TimerToken (was int) in TkDisplay
	structure to allow us to delete the timer scheduled for it.

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (TkWmStackorderToplevel): ensure children
	structure is freed.
	(ConfigureEvent, ComputeReparentGeometry): Add extra wm tracing info
	(TkWmRestackToplevel): initialize changes to 0 to prevent UMR.
	Use WaitForConfigureNotify on all windows.  This part still
	requires fixing as it is the root of the 2 second raise delay on
	some window managers (those that use extra wrapper windows of
	their own).

	* unix/tkUnixSend.c (TkSendCleanup): free send-related resources

	* unix/tkUnixEvent.c (TkpCloseDisplay): call TkSendCleanup and
	TkWmCleanup.

	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c (SelRcvIncrProc): added missing Tcl_Release
	of interp

	* generic/tkGet.c (FreeUidThreadExitProc): free thread-specific
	resources on thread exit

	* generic/tkFocus.c (TkFocusFree): frees TkMainInfo data
	* generic/tkClipboard.c (TkClipCleanup): frees TkDisplay data
	* generic/tkGC.c (TkGCCleanup): frees TkDisplay data

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (FontPkgCleanup): cleanup thread specific font
	resources on thread exit.

	* mac/tkMacXStubs.c (TkpOpenDisplay): memset the initial display
	structures to 0.

	* generic/tkOption.c (OptionThreadExitProc): freed tsd option
	stacks on thread exit.
	(Tk_GetOption): free mem used to get Tk_Uid

	* generic/tkMenu.c (ConfigureMenu): freed saved options in all
	error cases.

	* win/tkWinInt.h: declaration for TkWinGetUnicodeEncoding
	* win/tkWinDialog.c (GetFileNameW): use TkWinGetUnicodeEncoding
	* win/tkWinInit.c (TkpDisplayWarning): use TkWinGetUnicodeEncoding
	* win/tkWinFont.c: use TkWinGetUnicodeEncoding instead of static
	unicodeEncoding.

	* win/tkWinX.c (Tk_SetCaretPos): remove WM_IME_STARTCOMPOSITION
	and place the IME position within Tk_SetCaretPos.  Cache results in
	Tk_SetCaretPos to reduce unnecessary repositioning.  Also call
	DestroyCaret if we receive WM_KILLFOCUS.
	(TkpOpenDisplay): ZeroMemory the initial display structures.
	(TkWinGetUnicodeEncoding): Added so that Windows only needs to
	cache this value one, and then free it in TkWinXCleanup.
	(HandleIMEComposition): add support for Win98 and ATOK13
	IME. (yamamoto)

	* generic/tkConsole.c (ConsoleCmd): correct return that should
	have just set result code.

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c: Added PhotoFormatThreadExitProc to clean
	up on thread exit. (Tk_PhotoPutBlock) slight code updates

	* generic/tkPanedWindow.c (DestroyPanedWindow, ConfigureSlaves):
	fix mem leaks in not freeing slave info

	* win/configure:
	* win/tcl.m4: Enabled COFF as well as CV style debug info with

	* doc/wm.n:
	* mac/tkMacWm.c:
	* tests/wm.test:
	* unix/tkUnixWm.c:
	* win/tkWinWm.c: Update wm stackorder usage message
	to make it clear that either 1 or 3 arguments are
	required. [Bug 540013]

2002-04-08  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tkMacProjects.sea.hqx: added tkPanedWindow.c to projects
	* mac/tkMacAppInit.c: fixes to MSL stdin/stdout hookup to the
	TkConsole when using shared MSL libraries; fix for crashing
	bug on exit: writing to stdin/sterr when console has already
	been destroyed. (both fixes need support in MSL, see 
	'CW Pro6 changes' in tcl/mac/tcltkMacBuildSupport.sea.hqx)
	* mac/tkMacDialog.c: fixes to Navigation Services Dialog filter.
	* mac/tkMacDraw.c: add panic for overwide TkImages that would
	crash Tk on mac otherwise.

2002-04-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* mac/tkMacXStubs.c: added Tk_SetCaretPos stub (does nothing).
	* win/tkWinX.c: added Tk_SetCaretPos code to position IME windows
	correctly when WM_IME_STARTCOMPOSITION is received.
	* unix/tkUnixKey.c: added Tk_SetCaretPos and code for setting
	XIM caret in TkpGetString.

	* generic/tkStubInit.c:
	* generic/tkDecls.h:
	* generic/tk.decls: added Tk_SetCaretPos declaration.  This command
	allows users to indicate the cursor position and is used by XIM
	(Unix) or IME (Windows) to place the caret box correctly.  It is
	also part of correct Accessibility style on Windows to make the
	magnifier jump to the focus point.

	* win/tkWinButton.c (TkpDisplayButton): 
	* generic/tkTextMark.c (TkTextInsertDisplayProc):
	* generic/tkCanvText.c (DisplayCanvText):
	* generic/tkEntry.c (DisplayEntry): added Tk_SetCaretPos calls

	* generic/tkInt.h: added TK_XIM_SPOT #define (default 1).
	Added XFontSet attribute to TkDisplay when TK_XIM_SPOT is true.
	* generic/tkEvent.c (Tk_HandleEvent): made sure inputContexts are
	not getting created on DestroyNotify events (for dead windows).
	Added over-the-spot support if TK_XIM_SPOT is defined (default).
	The is the nicer XIM behavior, but uses a bit more memory.

	* unix/tkUnixEvent.c:
	* generic/tkWindow.c: moved OpenIM over to tkUnixEvent.c.
	Removed setting inputContext to null in Tk_MakeWindowExist as it
	was redundant.

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (CreateWrapper): Removed redundat setting of
	inputContext to null.

	* win/Makefile.in: changed gdb and shell targets to properly build
	all binaries before running (otherwise an error often occured).

2002-03-28  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/.cvsignore (new):
	* win/lamp.bmp (new):
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/nmakehlp.c (new):
	* win/rules.vc:  Brought the makefile up-to-date with Tcl's one.
	This now has support for Win9x issues and the winhelp target now
	exists.  Color scheme can be changed.  I'm just imparting a first
	suggestion using orange :)  I'll have to think about the install
	portion of the helpfile as I'll need to do some tricks to insert
	tk's contents file into Tcl's using some special winhlp32.exe
	switches.  [Bug 533862 527941]

	* win/makefile.vc:  Tk helpfile is now installing itself into Tcl's
	contents file as part of the install target and rebuilding the
	contents table as desired.  [Bug 527941]

	* doc/console.n:  Changed topic from "Tcl Built-In Commands" to
	"Tk Built-In Commands"

	* win/buildall.vc.bat:  Update to match Tcl.

2002-03-26  Andreas Kupries  <andreask_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c: Added inclusion of <arpa/inet.h>. This fixes
	  a GCC/HPUX problem with missing a "htons". See also
	  "tclUnixPort.h" for equivalent code.

2002-03-21  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Changed optimize flag to -0ti instead of -02.

2002-03-07  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/text.tcl (TextPasteSelection): Renaming of TextPaste to
	prevent confusion with tk_textPaste.  Stopped code from inserting
	selections twice, which seems to have happened with TIP#26, and
	reorganized code to reduce amount of stuff protected by catch
	which is tricky to maintain.
	(tk_textPaste): Reduce amount of code protected by catch.

2002-03-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tkWinX.c: Define _WIN32_IE as 0x0300
	before including commctrl.h so that we can
	access the InitCommonControlsEx API when
	building Tk with mingw.

2002-03-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* README, generic/tk.h, unix/configure.in, unix/tk.spec:
	* win/configure.in: Bumped patchlevel; this might need to change
	in the future, but it will help us distinguish between the CVS
	version and the most recent released version.

2002-03-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	*** 8.4a4 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* unix/README: updated --* options docs.

	on state change where necessary. [Bug #503772]

	* tests/listbox.test:
	* generic/tkListbox.c: corrected error handling when setting to an

	y args at all (they aren't used).
	Added proc comments.  Made configuring sash cursor more efficient.
	Added Cursor timer that restores the default cursor when pointer
	is no longer over the sash.  This is necessary because Leave
	events won't be seen when moving into a paned child.

2002-02-22  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/demos/widget: New section "Paned Windows"

	drag as well as triple click and drag in the text and
	entry widgets.

2002-02-14  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/event.test (_text_ind_to_x_y, _get_selection): Fix

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Don't set TCL_LIB_SPEC and

	of LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LIBPATH, and SHLIB_PATH
	before running tktest since it should no
	longer be required.

2002-01-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	Enable use of Tcl stubs when building Tk as
	a shared library. This should fix the build
	under AIX. [Bugs 220858, 220955, 220921]

	* unix/Makefile.in: Add TCL_STUB_LIB_SPEC and
	TCL_STUB_LIB_FLAG variables.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Pass TCL_STUB_LIB_SPEC into
	Makefile and use it when linking the tk shared library.
	Define USE_TCL_STUBS when building shared. Subst
	TCL_STUB_LIB_SPEC and TCL_STUB_LIB_FLAG.

2002-01-08  D. Richard Hipp  <drh@hwaci.com>

	* win/tkWinMenu.c: Fix the following bug: If you select an entry
	on a cascade menu then the next time the parent menu is posted, the
	cascade entry was active.  Also, if you traverse to a disabled entry
	using keystrokes and press ENTER on the disabled entry, then that
	entry appears active the next time the menu is posted.  The same
	patch fixes both problems.

2002-01-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkBind.c (TkBindFree):
	* generic/tkGrid.c (ResolveConstraints,CheckSlotData,DestroyGrid):
	* generic/tkSelect.c (Tk_DeleteSelHandler,TkSelDeadWindow): Replaced
	Tcl_Free calls with ckfree so that memory debugging is fully supported.

2001-12-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* test/winButton.test:
	* win/tkWinButton.c: added updated patch #463234 which returns the
	default sizing behavior (not so native), but enables native L&F
	with negative sizing (-11 for example).

	* library/text.tcl (tk::TextButton1): made text receive focus even
	in disabled state for Windows to show selection and allow
	mouse-wheel scrolling.

	* win/tkWinInit.c (TkpDisplayWarning): added Tcl_DStringFree's

	* win/tkWinInt.h:
	* win/tkWinX.c: added TkWinProcs that represent a function table
	to switch between unicode and ansi procs on Windows.  This is
	analogous to the TclWinProcs.  Using Tcl_WinUtfToTChar, we can
	easily take advantage of using unicode functions where available
	without having to switch on the platform id each time.

	* win/tkWinWm.c (InitWindowClass): corrected init routines to
	allow unicode in window titles on Windows (for Win2K/XP).
	(TkWmStackorderToplevel): Corrected casts to enable debug compile

	* win/configure: regen'ed
	* win/tcl.m4: added shell32.lib to link libs, as these are
	necessary for new directory chooser (when enabled).

	* win/tkWinDialog.c (Tk_MessageBoxObjCmd): use MessageBoxW for
	proper display of unicode errors.
	Added patch which uses new OLE based directory chooser.  This
	still has some issues, so is disabled by default. [Patch #468139]
	(ColorDlgHookProc) Corrected ability to use unicode chars in
	tk_chooseColor -title.

2001-12-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tkWinInit.c (TkpDisplayWarning): Use MessageBoxW in case the
	error displayed has unicode chars. [Bug #485986]

2001-12-27  Daniel Steffen <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tkMacInit.c:
	* mac/tkMacResource.r: synced up tkInit features to unix/win:
	use existing tkInit proc if defined. Added spinbox.tcl resource.
	Used TclGetEnv() instead of Tcl_GetVar2(interp, env)
	* mac/tkMacApplication.r:
	* mac/tkMacLibrary.r: minor version resources cleanup

2001-12-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkButton.c (ButtonTextVarProc): guard against being
	called while the *button/label is being deleted. [Bug #490051]

	* library/entry.tcl: 
	* library/spinbox.tcl: 
	* library/text.tcl: added extra checks against bug #220269 and
	made spinbox reuse more of the entry procedure code.

2001-12-20  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl.

	Tcl configure script to fix AIX build with gcc. [Bug 220955]

2001-12-18  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in: Use $(MAKE) instead of make
	in the tcltest rule.

2001-12-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/event.test (event-click-drag-1.2): Corrected test that
	failed on Solaris/CDE due to text scrolling.  [Bug 413735]

2001-12-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/spinbox.tcl (ButtonDown): added catch to ignore
	possible error in after cancel when Priv(afterId) isn't defined.

	* doc/spinbox.n: corrected spin(up|down) -> button(up|down)

2001-12-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/getOpenFile.n: Documented change.
	* library/tkfbox.tcl (SetFilter): Added code to guess the correct
	default extension from whatever value was selected in the
	filetypes option menu.  Adapted from code by Chris Nelson
	submitted in Patch #492220.

2001-12-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (TkWmStackorderToplevelWrapperMap): added static

2001-12-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkText.c:
	* generic/tkText.h: changed TkTextEditType enums to be prefaced
	with TK_EDIT_ to prevent name collision.

2001-12-05  Daniel Steffen <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tkMacWm.c: mac implementation of wm stackorder
	(patch 481148, TIP 74)

2001-12-03  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	Add TK patch 481148 to implement TIP 74, the
	wm stackorder command.

	* doc/winfo.n: Update documentation for the winfo
	children command to indicate that top-level windows
	are not returned in stacking order.
	* doc/wm.n: Add documentation for wm stackorder.
	* generic/tkInt.decls (TkWmStackorderToplevel):
	Add decl for new function.
	* generic/tkIntDecls.h: Regen.
	* generic/tkStubInit.c: Regen.
	* tests/unixWm.test: Add stackorder command to test
	for wm command usage message.

	better use of fonts, added an icon, fixed the About box.  Prompted
	by Bug #487442 from Vincent Wartelle.

2001-11-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/palette.tcl (tk_setPalette): Added heuristic to guess
	from the background whether to use black or white for the
	foreground when not told specifically.  Suggested by Chris Nelson,
	this makes the command fit the documentation better!

2001-11-27  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Fixed CAT32 target.  cat.c is located in the Tcl
	source, not the Tk source.

2001-11-27  D. Richard Hipp <drh@hwaci.com>

	* library/menu.tcl: Do not allow keyboard traversal of torn-off
	menus to visit the (invisible) tearoff bar.

2001-11-26  D. Richard Hipp <drh@hwaci.com>

	* win/tkWinMenu.c: disabled menu items show the activebackground
	color in their background.  This change makes menu behavior
	consistent with what native windows does.

2001-11-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Add comments to better describe
	TCL_EXE and when it should be available. Add
	rule that prints message about running `make genstubs`
	when tkStubInit.c is out of date.
	* win/Makefile.in: Add TCL_TOOL_DIR and TCL_EXE
	variables to better match the Tcl Makefile. Add
	genstubs rule so tkSTubInit.c can be regenerated.

2001-11-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Don't AC_SUBST CFLAGS_DEBUG, CFLAGS_OPTIMIZE,
	or CFLAGS_WARNING since it is now done in SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): AC_SUBST DL_LIBS, CFLAGS_DEBUG,
	CFLAGS_OPTIMIZE, and CFLAGS_WARNING.

2001-11-23  Daniel Steffen <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	Up-port to 8.4 of mac code changes for 8.3.3 & various new
	changes for 8.4, some already backported to 8.3.4 (patch #435660)

	* library/tk.tcl: added <Key-F1> binding for <<Undo>> on the mac (TIP26)

	* library/button.tcl: fixed undefined $Priv(repeated) error for button
	without -repeatdelay support

	* generic/tkConsole.c:
	* library/console.tcl:
	* mac/tkMacInit.c:
	* mac/tkMacResource.r: corrected how mac deals with tcl library
	files present both in resources and in $tk_library directory.

	* generic/tkConsole.c: crashing bug fix when printing to console
	at program exit after the console has already been closed.
	Now setting gStdoutInterp=NULL in ConsoleClose().

	* mac/tkMacInit.c: correct use of Tcl_JoinPath in tk_library
	initialization

	* mac/tkMacMenu.c: special MDEF_PROC_OFFSET only needed for
	exactly one specific version of the MWERKS 68k compiler .

	* mac/tkMacShLib.exp: removed file

	* unix/Makefile.in: removed reference to .exp files

	* mac/MWTkBuildLibHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TkBuildLibHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TkHeaderCommon.h:
	* mac/MW_TkOldImgStaticHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TkStaticHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TkStaticHeader.pch: new precompiled header files

	* mac/MW_TkHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TkOldImgHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TkTestHeader.pch: revised precompiled header handling: now
	include a common header file 'MW_TkHeaderCommon.h' from all .pch files,
	the .pch files themselves now only setup #defines (e.g. BUILD_tk,
	STATIC_BUILD, TCL_DEBUG, TCL_THREADS) like in makefiles on other
	platforms.

	* mac/tkMac.h:
	* mac/tkMacPort.h:
	* mac/tkMacInt.h: use of BUILD_tk and TCL_STORAGE_CLASS like on other
	platforms, standardize #include'd files to what's done on other
	platforms, removed use of #pragma export, changed extern to EXTERN
	where appropriate to enable DLL export via the TCL_STORAGE_CLASS
	mechanism.

	* mac/tkMacAppearanceStubs.c: removed use of #pragma export

	* mac/widget.r: new resource file for 'Widget Demos'

	* mac/tkMacProjects.sea.hqx: updated mac build project files:
	build support for CodeWarrior Pro6, UnivIntf 3.4 & shared runtime
	libraries (see Tcl ChangeLog for details).
	changed weak linking so that CFM68k binaries now work on all OS
	versions from the free 7.5.5 onwards, with or without AppearanceMgr
	and/or NavigationMgr installed.
	added target to automatically build 'Widget Demos'
	included XML versions of the projects for CW Pro5 or Pro7 users.
	use compat/strtod.c instead of MSL's strtod()

	* generic/tkInt.decls:
	* generic/tkIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tkIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tkStubInit.c:

	* mac/tkMacInt.h: MAC_TCL tk stub support was badly broken due to
	multiply defined (mac specific) names in tk.decls and tkInt.decls,
	removed the duplicates from the internal unsupported interfaces
	"interface tkInt" and "interface tkIntPlat"; moved declaration of
	TkpIsWindowFloating from tkMacInt.h to tkInt.decls: interface tkIntPlat.
	- these changes to the stub tables might require you to recompile your
	Tk extensions if they turn out to reference one of the removed routines
	in the wrong table (should be unlikely).

	* generic/tkMain.c: MAC_TCL: workaround for broken/non-standard isatty
	on MW Pro6, #include <unistd.h> instead of defining isatty
	
	* generic/tkPointer.c: MAC_TCL: #include tkMacInt.h

	* generic/tkStubLib.c: MAC_TCL: removed obsolete special casing of mac
	headers, standardize #include'd files to what's done on other platforms

	* mac/tkMacFont.c:
	* mac/tkMacDialog.c: 
	* mac/tkMacButton.c: renamed obsolete apple API names to modern
	equivalents; UH3.4 support: added #include <ControlDefinitions.h>;
	fixed munged non-ASCII chars in sources due to bungled latin1<->mac
	roman encoding in CVS repository.

	* mac/tkMacDialog.c: added support for -filetypes option (fix for bug
	tcl #221636); added update event handling for background windows while
	in a NavigationMgr dialog; fixed nasty bug when calling CustomGetFile
	(missing addr operator) (fix for bug tk #220911 & tcl #219367); renamed
	routines conflicting with standard MoreFiles headers (see Tcl ChangeLog
	for details)

	* mac/tkMacApplication.r:
	* mac/tkMacLibrary.r:
	* mac/tkMacResource.r: fixed obsolete copyrights/dates in version
	strings, updated version strings to standard usage, added support for
	'(Support Libraries)' subfolder for shared runtime libraries in
	unmerged binaries, commented out demo setting of "Tcl Environment
	Variables"; reorganized resources among these files to avoid 
	multiple copies in applications and shared libraries, the script
	libraries/Xcursors etc are now no longer duplicated in Wish but are
	only included in the resources of Tk.shlb.

	* mac/tkMacMenu.c: 
	* mac/tkMacMDEF.r: changes to support MW Pro 6 68k (vers 0x2400 only) 
	compiler producing different offset to start of MDEF; fix to static 68k
	presence testing when calling the custom MDEF

	* mac/tkMacWm.c.c:
	* mac/tkMacWindowMgr.c: added/fixed AppearanceMgr checks; override
	AppearanceMgr version detection on static 68k to ensure static 68k Wish
	runs on PPCs with recent AppearanceMgr

	improved speed. (callewaert, darley)
	(DestroyText): plugged mem leak when not clearing stack (callewaert)
	(TextGetText): more efficient string size calculation (darley)

2001-11-19  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/demos/entry3.tcl: New demo showing off validation and
	password entry.

	simpler, plus a new entry demo.

2001-11-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tkWinButton.c (TkpComputeButtonGeometry): corrected the
	default size of Windows buttons to conform to the Windows style.

2001-11-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/demos/image2.tcl: Many improvements to this
	image-viewing demo; now uses labelframes and tk_chooseDirectory

	* library/palette.tcl (::tk::RecolorTree): Made this work better
	with CDE, which does some extremely annoying things with the
	option database that interact badly with Tk's way of handling
	options.

	* doc/text.n: Overhauled the documentation of undo to make it
	easier to understand.
	* library/tk.tcl (::tk::EventMotifBindings): Added Emacs-like undo
	binding, but not behaviour (we separate undo and redo.)
	* library/demos/text.tcl: Show off our undo capability!

2001-11-12  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/mkd.bat:
	* win/rmd.bat:  Removed -kb CVS attribute and added changes

	* library/demos/menu.tcl: Show off -compound support in menus.

	* library/demos/radio.tcl: Added some code to both show off the
	extra capabilities of the buttons and also show what can be done
	with compound images on the sly.

2001-11-10  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in: Add "make gdb" target. This target
	can run wish inside either gdb or insight.

2001-11-09  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/clrpick.tcl: changed a few parameters so that the full
	0..255 range could be accessed via the mouse. [Bug #478498]

	of the MS Common Controls library when available (WinXP+).  This
	enables use of the themeable widgets (like scrollbars) to be used
	in Tk. [Patch #478933]

2001-11-09  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure:

	Avoid adding libc to the LIBS and WISH_LIBS
	variables since it is not needed when linking with CC.
	If required when linking with LD it should be done
	on a case by case basis in tcl.m4.

2001-11-05  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/demos/dialog2.tcl: Typo-fix.
	* library/demos/browse, library/demos/ixset, library/demos/rolodex:

	out.

2001-10-30  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/demos/widget: Integrated labelframe item into the labels
	section and added a spinbox demo to the (retitled) entry section.

	labelframe widget to better effect and have a better description.

	* library/demos/spin.tcl: New demo to show off spinbox capabilities.

	* library/demos/rolodex: Changes up-ported from core-8-3-1-branch
	to make the script use more 8.*-isms, but not menus due to the way
	the context help system works.

	* library/demos/ixset: Changed to use the labelframe widget and
	the grid geometry manager.

2001-10-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/demos/browse: Changes up-ported from core-8-3-1-branch
	to make the script much more robust, particularly when neither the
	current version of wish or the script are on the path.

	* library/demos/hello: Added emacs trailing tag-line.

	* library/demos/tcolor: Changes up-ported from core-8-3-1-branch
	to make the script compliant with current good practise, as well
	as extensive use of the new labelframe widget.

	* library/demos/timer: Changes up-ported from core-8-3-1-branch to
	make the script look and work better.

	* library/demos/rmt: Changes up-ported from core-8-3-1-branch to

	useful to people.

2001-10-23  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tkCursor.c (Tk_GetCursorFromData): Fixed uninit nextPtr

	* generic/tkObj.c (TkGetWindowFromObj): Rewrote window code to
	reuse a previously worked-out set of window information exactly
	when the reference window is the same and no window deletions have
	occurred since the object was allocated (display has same epoch
	counter.)  Required changing the internal rep of the window quite
	a bit as now need to save three words-worth of information in the
	internal rep (this window, reference window, display epoch.)
	* generic/tkObj.c (SetWindowFromAny, DupWindowInternalRep,
	FreeWindowInternalRep): Code to support new internal rep for
	window objects.

	* generic/tkObj.c (TkGetWindowFromObj): Was failing to reuse
	cached window objects, forcing a call to Tcl_GetStringFromObj and
	Tk_NameToWindow every time.  This fault has been in there for
	nearly three years...

2001-08-15  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes: Labelled the TIP 44 changes as "POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY".
	Although technically internal changes are not incompatible, they'll
	be perceived as such by those who get bitten, and this will help
	them find the cause of their trouble.

2001-08-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* win/winMain.c (WishPanic): fixed CONST changes to go with
	CONST-ification in Tcl.

	* win/configure: regenerated
	* win/tcl.m4: fixed DLLSUFFIX definition to always be ${DBGX}.dll.
	This is necessary for TEA compliant builds that build shared

	backslash [Bug #438247]

2001-07-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Tk_DestroyWindow): changed to use
	Tcl_EventuallyFree instead of ckfree so that widgets that have
	references to a tkwin can use them.

	* generic/tkCanvArc.c:
	* generic/tkCanvBmap.c:
	* generic/tkCanvLine.c:
	* generic/tkCanvPoly.c:
	* generic/tkCanvText.c:
	* generic/tkCanvWind.c:
	* generic/tkRectOval.c: corrected argument handling in

	* library/console.tcl:
	* library/entry.tcl:
	* library/spinbox.tcl:
	* library/text.tcl:
	* library/tk.tcl: added private ::tk::GetSelection command to

	Entry and Console to use this command.

	* tests/select.test:
	* generic/tkSelect.c (Tk_CreateSelHandler, Tk_DeleteSelHandler):
	on Unix, a UTF8_STRING handler will be created when the user
	requests a STRING handler (in addition to the STRING handler).
	This provides implicit support for the new UTF8_STRING selection
	target.
	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c (TkSelEventProc, ConvertSelection): Added
	support for UTF8_STRING target. [RFE #418653, Patch #433283]

	* win/tcl.m4: Fix silly typo in last checkin.

2001-06-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Set CFLAGS to @CFLAGS@ and @CFLAGS_DEFAULT@.
	Set LDFLAGS to @LDFLAGS@ and @LDFLAGS_DEFAULT@. Add LDFLAGS_DEBUG
	and LDFLAGS_OPTIMIZE to match the way CFLAGS_DEFAULT works. Use
	new LDFLAGS variable in the Makefile instead of @LDFLAGS@.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Don't set CFLAGS to CFLAGS_DEFAULT, instead
	subst CFLAGS_DEFAULT into the Makefile. Add AC_SUBST for CFLAGS_DEBUG,
	CFLAGS_OPTIMIZE, LDFLAGS_DEFAULT, LDFLAGS_DEBUG, and LDFLAGS_OPTIMIZE.
	Remove unused LD_FLAGS subst.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl.
	* win/Makefile.in: Set CFLAGS to @CFLAGS@ and @CFLAGS_DEFAULT@.
	Set LDFLAGS to @LDFLAGS@ and @LDFLAGS_DEFAULT@.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Don't set CFLAGS or LDFLAGS, instead subst
	CFLAGS_DEFAULT and LDFLAGS_DEFAULT into the Makefile.
	* win/tcl.m4: Update from Tcl.

2001-06-21  eric melski  <ericm@interwoven.com>

	* doc/colors.n: Corrected bogus documentation with respect to
	several shades of blue, all of which were listed as RGB 0 0 0.
	[Bug #432104].

	docs.  [Patch #422256]

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c: Corrected support for iso10646 (X11 Unicode)
	fonts on Unix. This adds a ucs-2be (UCS-2 Big Endian) encoding in
	Tk on Unix that is used for those fonts (X11 requires
	big-endianness). (welch) [Patch #406411; Bug #220890 #220899]
	This differs from the 8.3.3 patch by not adding ucs-2be in the
	preferred encodingList (seems works fine without).
	Added alias for jisx0201* fonts to jis0201 encoding. [Bug #414033]

2001-05-30  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tkWinKey.c (TkpSetKeycodeAndState): removed old debug info

2001-05-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	TkWinXInit to TkWinGetPlatformId because static builds could call
	it before it was initialized. [Bug #427278]

2001-05-28  Peter Spjuth  <peter.spjuth@space.se>

	* generic/tkFrame.c:
	* generic/tkWindow.c:

	* unix/tkUnixMenubu.c: Implementation of TIP #11, the addition of
	a -compound option to the menubutton allowing text and an image to
	be displayed at the same time.  This behavior is identical to the
	behavior of the button widget.

2001-05-16  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/console.n: Added - was erroneously placed in Tcl before...

	tests fail.

	* tests/winDialog.test: string totitle'd some results that
	expected [pwd] to return a capital drive letter.

	'arrow' on windows has a pre-skewed use count.

	* win/tkWinDialog.c (GetFileNameA): initialize multi to 0.

2001-04-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	BRANCH dgp-privates-into-namespace:
	* library/unsupported.tcl: New file for Tk's unsupported

2001-02-12  D. Richard Hipp  <drh@hwaci.com>

	TIP #21: Asymmetric padding in the pack and grid geometry managers.
	With this changes, you can now say "-padx {10 20}" to put 10 pixels
	of padding on the left and 20 on the right.  Similar rules apply
	for vertical padding.  See the revised documentation for details.

2001-01-02  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

2000-12-12  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/entry.n: Improved documentation of interplay between the
	  -state and -textvariable options.

2000-11-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/image.test (image-1.10): Improved this test, which
	  previously only worked if the command failed to delete the root
	  window, and caused *major* trouble otherwise...
	* generic/tkImage.c (EventuallyDeleteImage): Created this function
	  so that images that get deleted during the creation of an image
	  won't cause a nasty core dump.  Properly fixes bug #120819.

2000-11-28  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/image.n: 
	* generic/tkImage.c (Tk_ImageObjCmd): Backed out previous change.
	  Bug #120819 is back again in force.  Left the test in there
	  though.

2000-11-23  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/image.n: 
	* tests/image.test (image-1.10):
	* generic/tkImage.c (Tk_ImageObjCmd): Prohibited image names that
	  start with "." since they can cause some really obscure
	  crashes.  Fixes Bug #120819.

2000-11-21  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	Overall change:  Implemented TIP 5, which exports
	TkClassProcs/TkSetClassProcs as Tk_ClassProcs/Tk_SetClassProcs,
	adding a size field to Tk_ClassProcs to allow for future
	expansion, and renaming the geometryProc to worldChangedProc,
	which is more in keeping with the actual use of the callback.

	* unix/mkLinks: Added link for Tk_SetClassProcs.

	* doc/SetClassProcs.3: Documentation for
	Tk_ClassProcs/Tk_SetClassProcs.

	* generic/tkCanvas.c:
	* generic/tkEntry.c:
	* generic/tkFrame.c:
	* generic/tkListbox.c:

	instead of TkClassProcs/TkSetClassProcs.

	* generic/tkMenubutton.c:
	* generic/tkScrollbar.c:
	* generic/tkButton.c: Updated to use Tk_SetClassProcs instead of
	TkSetClassProcs.

	* generic/tkStubInit.c:
	* generic/tkIntDecls.h: Regenned from tk.decls, tkInt.decls.
	
	* generic/tk.h: Added declaration of Tk_ClassProcs, with size
	field.  Added typedef's for Tk_ClassCreateProc,
	Tk_ClassWorldChangedProc, Tk_ClassModalProc.  Added definition of
	Tk_GetClassProc macro, shorthand for extracting a member of the
	Tk_ClassProcs structure.

	* generic/tkInt.h: Removed declaration of TkClassProcs,
	TkClassGeometryProc, etc.

	* generic/tkBind.c (Tk_BindEvent): Updated to use Tk_GetClassProc
	macro to extract modalProc; added check that the modalProc is non-NULL.

	* generic/tkFont.c (RecomputeWidgets): Updated to use
	Tk_GetClassProc macro to extract worldChangedProc; added comment
	about the choice of a recursive versus iterative algorithm for
	propagating world changed messages.

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Tk_MakeWindowExist): Updated to use
	Tk_GetClassProc macro to extract createProc from Tk_ClassProcs.

	* generic/tk.decls: Added declaration for Tk_SetClassProcs.

	* generic/tkInt.decls: Commented out declaration for
	TkSetClassProcs, which is made public by this change.  The entry
	is left in place, but commented, so that future developers will
	know not to reuse it's stub number.

2000-11-21  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/ConfigWidg.3: Added deprecation note from Bug #120944 - use
	Tk_SetOption() instead.

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (TkPhotoGetValidRegion): Applied patch to
	create this function and add it to tkInt stubs.  Should now be
	possible to write an extension that accesses the transparency data
	in a photo image.  Bug #120930

2000-11-03  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	8.4a2 RELEASE

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Initialize): added call to Tcl_SetMainLoop.
	This only has effect when tclsh is run (not wish), and then Tk is
	loaded in interactively.

2000-11-02  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkWinButton.c:
	* win/tkWinDialog.c:
	* win/tkWinScrlbr.c:
	* win/tkWinWm.c: fixed up code for Win64 support.  This mostly
	remains in _WIN64 #ifdef's, until updated compilers are standard.

	* win/tcl.m4:
	* win/makefile.vc: updated for Win64 compile support

	* unix/configure:
	* win/configure: checked in configure scripts so people doing
	CVS checkouts aren't required to have autoconf.  Changes to
	configure.in in the future will require the corresponding
	configure script to also be re-autoconf'ed and checked in.

	* doc/event.n: added note that key events require window focus.

2000-11-01  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c (GetFileNameW, GetFileNameA,
	Tk_ChooseDirectoryObjCmd): created
	work-around for change in NT5.0/98 that caused no initialdir
	setting to open the browser up in the user's documents dir.

	* tests/color.test: marked color-2.6 nonPortable as we can't
	reliably assume what 'red' maps to.

2000-11-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tests/winDialog.test: Corrected expected results for bad option
	tests (5.2, 5.5) to include -multiple option.

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Added branch for 0 return from
	CommDlgExtendedError() switches; this was formerly treated as an
	error, but it actually is not, since it just means the user hit
	cancel or closed the dialog.  (GetFileNameW): Added better smarts
	such that -multiple is not considered a valid option for
	tk_getSaveFile.
	Removed CommDlgExtendedError() checks for color and choosedir
	dialogs, and removed all except the explicit invalid filename
	checks for the file dialogs.

	support for building a static wish shell with cursor resources.

2000-10-27  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4: added support for AIX-5.

	* tests/tk.test: 
	* doc/tk.n: updated to reflect default on status of useinputmethods.
	* library/tk.tcl: tk useinputmethods is set to 1 by default.  This
	enables Kanji and dead-char input by default.  Intro'd in
	1999-12-16 with default off to avoid some problems with older X
	servers that would slow down widget creation over time.

	* win/Makefile.in (test, winhelp, tktest): corrected the
	TCL_LIBRARY path specification.

2000-10-18  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkWinDraw.c (RenderObject): Applied patch from [Bug: 6368],
	which corrects rendering of 1-pixel wide stippled lines on Windows.

	* generic/tkCanvLine.c (DisplayLine): Applied patch from 
	[Bug: 6368], corrects bugs relating to use of active- and
	disabledwidth values for displaying lines (disabledwidth was never
	used, and activewidth/disablewidths would only possibly be used
	when greater than default width, rather than when simply not equal
	to default width).

	* library/tkfbox.tcl (OkCmd): Applied patch from [Bug: 6365],
	which adds safety for directory names containing spaces or which
	are non-lists.

	* win/tkWinDialog.c (GetFileNameW, GetFileNameA, 
	Tk_ChooseColorObjCmd, Tk_ChooseDirectoryObjCmd): Added error
	checking for the return value from the common dialog functions, so
	that the commands will not silently fail if the common dialog
	returns an error. [Bug: 6369].

2000-10-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkConfig.c (Tk_InitOptions): Added
	Tcl_IncrRefCount/Tcl_DecrRefCount calls on valuePtr, to prevent
	memory leaks when the value object comes from the option
	database.  [Bug: 6275].

2000-10-06  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/Makefile.in (cat32.${OBJEXT}): add win/ subdirectory to
	cat32 target to correctly find the source file.

2000-10-05  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkCmds.c (Tk_WinfoObjCmd): Added check for
	TK_ANONYMOUS_WINDOW flag in the [winfo children] subcommand; if
	set, the window will not be printed in the list of children.

	* doc/CrtWindow.3: Added entry for Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow.

	* generic/tkWindow.c 
	(Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow): New API for creating anonymous
	windows.  These windows are manipulable from C, but not from Tcl,
	because they have no pathname associated with them.  They are used
	initially by widgets that do rubber-band resizing (panedwindow,
	multi-column listbox, etc.), and may be useful for other widgets
	as well (dropbox, combobox).
	(Tk_DestroyWindow): Added check for TK_ANONYMOUS_WINDOW flag when
	determining whether to generate a DestroyNotify event.

	* generic/tkStubInit.c: 
	* generic/tkDecls.h: Regen'd from tk.decls.

	* generic/tk.decls: Added Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow declaration.

	* generic/tk.h: Added TK_ANONYMOUS_WINDOW flag for Tk_Window's.

2000-10-04  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* doc/MaintGeom.3: Noted that Tk_MaintainGeometry handles direct
	descendants properly.

	* generic/tkGeometry.c (Tk_MaintainGeometry): Added a check for
	the case in which the slave window is a direct descendant of the
	master window.  In this case, we need not set up the additional
	infrastructure normally provide by Tk_MaintainGeometry, because we
	can rely on the parent/child relationship to handle it for us
	implicitly.  In this case, Tk_MaintainGeometry just calls directly
	to Tk_MoveResizeWindow.  This allows geometry managers to simply
	always use Tk_MaintainGeometry to maintain geometry for slaves,
	and avoid doing the direct descendant check themselves.
	(Tk_UnmaintainGeometry): Added a matching check for the direct
	descendant case; in this case, Tk_UnmaintainGeometry simply
	returns immediately.

2000-10-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkButton.c (ConfigureButton): Added tests for -compound
	option, so that when there is a textvariable and an image, and
	-compound is not none, the button will display both the
	textvariable and the image.

	* doc/SetOptions.3: Added note that restoreProc and freeProc may
	be NULL.

	* generic/tkConfig.c (Tk_RestoreSavedOptions): For custom options,
	added test that the restoreProc is not NULL, to allow for custom
	options that don't care about supporting Tk_RestoreSavedOptions.

2000-09-29  D. Richard Hipp <drh@hwaci.com>

	* generic/tkBitmap.c: Changes to prevent a BadMatch error from the
	Xserver when the same bitmap is used on two or more screens of the
	same display.

	* tests/menu.test: Print a warning if the TK_ALT_DISPLAY environment
	variable is not configured so as to test for the bug fix above.

	* library/tk.tcl (::tk::SetGrabFocus): "Catch" the grab in case
	another application already holds the grab and the "grab" command
	fails.

2000-09-29  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: commented use of TESTFLAGS
	* unix/Makefile.in: added TESTFLAGS to test and testlang targets to
	conform with Windows makefile and TEA style.

2000-09-29  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkTest.c: Fixed tests to use updated API.

	* doc/SetOptions.3:
	* generic/tk.h: 
	* generic/tkConfig.c: Changed interface for Tk_CustomOptionSetProc
	and Tk_CustomOptionGetProc; these now take a pointer to the start
	of the widget record, and an integer offset to the slot for the
	option value, instead of just a pointer to the slot.  This allows
	more sophisticated options to do interesting things based on other
	data in the widget record.

2000-09-17  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tk.h: Added declaration of Tk_ObjCustomOption structure,
	used for TK_OPTION_CUSTOM, and typedef's of the functions
	Tk_CustomOptionSetProc, Tk_CustomOptionGetProc,
	Tk_CustomOptionRestoreProc, and Tk_CustomOptionFreeProc, used for
	TK_OPTION_CUSTOM.

	* doc/SetOptions.3: Added documentation of TK_OPTION_CUSTOM, and
	section "CUSTOM OPTION TYPES" explaining how to create and use
	custom options.

	* tests/config.test: Added tests for custom option type.

	* generic/tkTest.c: Added test support for TK_OPTION_CUSTOM to
	TestobjconfigObjCmd.  Added CustomOption* functions to implement a
	test custom option.

	* generic/tkConfig.c: Added new option type TK_OPTION_CUSTOM,
	which allows the definition of custom option types by creating
	parsing, printing, freeing, and restoring procedures for a custom
	option.  This is needed by the text and canvas widgets if they are
	to be fully objectified.

2000-09-07  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/Tk_Init.3:
	* doc/bell.n:
	* doc/loadTk.n: minor doc cleanup

2000-09-06  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* doc/HWNDToWindow.3: 
	* doc/GetHWND.3: Changed synopsis to indicate the tkPlatDecls.h
	should be included, not tk.h.

	* generic/tkPlatDecls.h: Removed #include <windows.h> for Windows,
	a better solution for now is to update the docs and have extension
	authors #include <tkPlatDecls.h>.

	* generic/tk.h: Removed '#include "tkPlatDecls.h"', as the
	incorrect inclusion order between windows.h/tkPlatDecls.h causes
	build conflicts on Windows.

	* generic/tkPlatDecls.h: Added #include <windows.h> for Windows,
	so that HWND, etc., are defined properly.

2000-09-06  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/canvas.n: fixed doc bug (ellson). [Bug: 6218]

	int to fix pedantic warning.

2000-09-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/makefile.vc (install-libraries): 
	* win/Makefile.in (install-libraries): 
	* unix/Makefile.in (install-libraries): Added tkPlatDecls.h to
	list of header files to install.

	* generic/tk.h: Added #include "tkPlatDecls.h", which declares the
	platform specific component of the public Tk stubs API's.

2000-08-29  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (DrawWindowsSystemBitmap): Use scratchDC
	for determining the source's logical coordinates.  Patch from 
	[Bug: 6134 (Markus Oberhumer)].

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (SetDefaults): Compute the indicatorDimensions[]
	under Windows NT/2000 in the same way as under Windows 95/98.
	Patch from [Bug: 6134 (Markus Oberhumer)].

	* win/tkWinFont.c (GetScreenFont): Added a memset() to
	pacify memory checkers.  Patch from [Bug: 6134 (Markus Oberhumer)].

	* library/tkfbox.tcl (::tk::dialog::file::Update): Corrected
	handling of multi-pattern filters (eg, "* *.*"), which was broken
	by the getOpenFile performance patches applied earlier.

2000-08-24  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

2000-08-18  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (ImgPhotoGet): Removed redundant call to
	DitherInstance; this call was formerly being made from
	ImgPhotoGet->ImgPhotoConfigureInstance->DitherInstance, and
	ImgPhotoGet->DitherInstance.  The second call was removed.

2000-08-10  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/SetOptions.3: added missing ')'.

2000-08-09  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* doc/SetOptions.3: Updated documentation to reflect support for
	TK_OPTION_NULL_OK for TK_OPTION_DOUBLE and TK_OPTION_PIXELS.

	* doc/place.n: Updated, reformatted manual entry.

	* tests/place.test: Added many tests.

	* generic/tkPlace.c (Tk_PlaceObjCmd): Updated to use Tk
	widget-option management facilities to manage place options (-x,
	-y, etc.), which simplifies the placer code.  Added support for
	[place configure pathName] and [place configure pathName -option],
	similar to the behavior of the configure subcommand supported by
	widgets.

2000-08-08  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tests/place.test: Extended test suite to test error returns from
	[place].

	Tcl_Obj'ified command.

	* generic/tkCmds.c (Tk_BindtagsObjCmd): Tcl_Obj'ified [bindtags]
	command.

2000-08-02  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkCmds.c (Tk_TkwaitObjCmd): Tcl_Obj'ified [tkwait] command.

	* generic/tkWindow.c: Updated "tkwait" command entry to use
	Tcl_Obj'ified command.

2000-08-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkInt.h: Replaced prototype for Tk_MessageCmd with
	prototype for Tk_MessageObjCmd.

	* generic/tkWindow.c: Marked message command as using the new
	MessageObjCmd instead of the old MessageCmd.

	* tests/message.test: Added tests for the message widget.

2000-07-28  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* unix/tkUnixButton.c (TkpDisplayButton): Added bits to change
	the indicator color when radio-/check-buttons are disabled.  This
	reduces the visual incongruity when a group of these controls are
	disabled together.

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (ReconfigureWindowsMenu): Added MF_GRAYED bit
	for disabled menu entries, to ensure that those which are drawn by
	the system are shown grayed (such as entries on menubars) [Bug: 4372].

	* doc/label.n: Added -disabledforeground to list of options [Bug:
	6053].

	* mac/tkMacDefault.h: 
	* unix/tkUnixDefault.h: Added default values for listbox
	disabledforeground and state.

	* win/tkWinDefault.h: Changed default listbox background color to

	"Microsoft Windows User Experience"; added default values for
	listbox disabledforeground and listbox state.

	* doc/listbox.n: Added documentation for -state option.

	* generic/tkListbox.c: Added support for -state to listbox. [RFE:
	6052].

	* tests/listbox.test: Tests for listbox disabled state.

2000-07-27  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure.in: TCL_STUB_LIB_FLAG and
	TK_STUB_LIB_FLAG should not include ${TCL_DBGX}
	in win/tkConfig.sh, fix that.

2000-07-25  Joe English  <jenglish@flightlab.com>
	* doc: CanvPsY.3, ConfigWidg.3, CrtImgType.3, CrtItemType.3, 
	FontId.3, GetFont.3, canvas.n, font.n, options.n, text.n:
	Documentation fix: Replaced references to XFontStruct *
	and Tk_FontStruct with Tk_Font.

2000-07-24  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tests/text.test: Added tests for -regexp -nocase searches with
	backslash character classes.

	* generic/tkText.c (TextSearchCmd): Text search did not work
	properly when -regexp and -nocase were used, in combination with
	backslash character classes represented by capital letters (ie,
	\W, \M); altered implementation of -regexp -nocase searches to use
	new regexp interfaces to fix this problem.  [Bug: 5988].

2000-07-21  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tests/text.test: Added tests for searching when text is elided.

	* generic/tkText.c (TextSearchCmd): Text search was not returning
	the correct index when the search covered (but did not search)
	elided characters; corrected this by adjusting the match index by
	the number of elided characters preceeding the start of the match,
	just as is done with embedded windows, etc. [Bug: 5470].

2000-07-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure.in: Add TK_STUB_LIB_FLAG and
	TK_BUILD_STUB_LIB_SPEC. These are needed to build a stub enabled
	extension.

2000-07-20  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* unix/tkUnixDraw.c (TkScrollWindow): Replaced a use of a trinary
	operator with an if/else, to avoid build problems on some
	platforms [Bug: 5819].

	* win/makefile.vc: Applied patch from Don Porter to enhance nmake
	support on NT/Alpha [RFE: 5939].

2000-07-19  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* library/text.tcl: Enhanced <Tab> binding to behave like normal
	<Tab> bindings when the text widget is disabled (ie, it advances
	focus to the next widget).

	* generic/tkText.c (TextSearchCmd): Added a test for a NULL
	segment pointer when doing backwards searches for "" on an empty
	text widget. [Bug: 6007].

2000-07-18  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/aclocal.m4: Use tcl.m4.

	* unix/configure.in: Properly quote LOCALES variable. Properly quote

	so that it uses the TK_SRC_DIR in the same way
	as the unix version.

2000-07-17  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkConsole.c: Added comments for a Win2K OS bug with
	GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE).  No change was done to the code
	as the resulting behaviour of ShouldUseConsoleChannel() was
	correct, anyways. [BUG: 5971]

2000-07-17  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkStubImg.c (Tk_InitImageArgs): Applied patch from [Bug:
	5990], from Anselm Lingnau, which correctly sets the value of
	useNewImage to 0 when the new image system is not to be used,
	instead of leaving it at -1, which causes the check to be
	performed more times than is really necessary.
	
	* library/bgerror.tcl: Fixed a typo in one of the bgerror dialog
	label.

	* library/msgs/it.msg: Italian message catalog, from Paolo
	Brutti. [RFE: 6012].

	Nijtmans.

2000-06-30  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* doc/keysyms.n: 
	* doc/colors.n: Added extra .CE/.CS pairs to break up the large
	text block, so that the generated Windows help file could
	accomodate the manual entry. [Bug: 5862]

	* tests/filebox.test: Adjusted tests to accomodate -multiple.

	* library/xmfbox.tcl: Adjusted arguments list construction such
	that -multiple is not presented as an option for tk_getSaveFile.

	* library/tk.tcl: Added test for safe interpreter status before
	attempting to load message catalogs (which is impossible in a
	standard safe interpreter).  This means that SafeTk will not have
	localized dialogs, unless a means is found for loading the message
	catalog files.

2000-06-29  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/msgs/de.msg: German message catalog.

	provide localization of Tk dialogs. [RFE: 2671].

2000-06-27  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkMenu.c (DeleteMenuCloneEntries): Applied fix from
	[Bug: 5275], which corrected a segfault-causing indexing problem
	when deleting entries from torn-off menus.

2000-06-22  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* doc/getOpenFile.n: Updated with information about -multiple.

	* library/choosedir.tcl: Tweaked to handle modified tkIconList API's.

	* library/tkfbox.tcl: Preliminary implementation of multiple
	selection; based on patch from [RFE: 604].  Some of the tkIconList
	functions changed to support this and to make the dialog faster.

	* library/xmfbox.tcl: Added support for multiple selection, from
	patch in [RFE: 4999].

2000-06-21  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/text.tcl: Corrected behavior of text widget with respect
	to this sequence of events:  click, shift-click.  Previously, the
	shift-click just moved the cursor and anchor; now, the shift-click
	will select the text between the click and the shift-click, which
	is the behavior most users expect. [Bug: 5929].

2000-06-19  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/bgerror.tcl: Added auto-truncation for long error
	messages (more than 30 characters wide, or more than 4 lines
	long), so that the dialog remains a manageable size. [RFE: 5782]

2000-06-15  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Patched to support tk_getOpenFile
	-multiple. [RFE: 604].

2000-06-13  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/aclocal.m4: 
	* win/configure.in: 
	* win/Makefile.in: Applied patch from [RFE: 5844], to provide
	support for the mingw compile environment for Windows.

2000-06-06  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	8.4a1 RELEASE

	* generic/tkDecls.h:
	* generic/tk.decls: Added Tk_CreateClientMessageHandler and
	Tk_DeleteClientMessageHandler declarations.
	* generic/tkEvent.c (Tk_HandleEvent): Added
	Tk_CreateClientMessageHandler and Tk_DeleteClientMessageHandler to
	allow adding event handlers that invoke for ClientMessage events.
	This is necessary to support unix dnd protocols.

2000-06-02  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* canvas.test: added test for 5783.
	* generic/tkCanvPoly.c (DisplayPolygon): added checks for the
	polygon fillGC not being empty to prevent segfault. [Bug: 5783]

2000-05-31  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/bgerror.tcl: Improved bgerror based on work by Donal
	K. Fellows; no longer dependant on tk_dialog; features a
	Windows-esque "Details" button, and a customizable extra function
	button that allows the user to (for example) save the stack trace
	to a file.

2000-05-30  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c: Changed defines for GIF87a/GIF89a to be
	static char arrays with integer initialization, to address EBCIDIC
	vs. ASCII encoding issues and to handle compilers that don't deal
	with "\xAB" syntax for specifying hex values in strings.

2000-05-28  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/spinbox.n: (new file) docs for spinbox widget
	* generic/tkInt.h: added Tk_SpinboxObjCmd declaration
	* generic/tkEntry.c: added 'spinbox' widget - an extension of the
	entry widget type.
	* generic/tkWindow.c: added 'spinbox' to core Tk commands
	* library/spinbox.tcl: (new file) binding and helper procs for spinbox
	* library/tk.tcl: added spinbox.tcl to list of files to source
	* tests/entry.test: updated changed error messages
	* tests/spinbox.test: (new file) test suite for spinbox

	* generic/tkPlace.c (Tk_PlaceCmd): reworked place master/slave
	table init'n to prevent seg fault when using place on multiple
	displays.

	* generic/tk.h: added comments ot Tk_FakeWin structure

2000-05-26  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkOption.c (Tk_GetOption): Extended Tk_GetOption to
	support a new syntax for option names in option tables.  If the
	option name has an embedded ".", it indicates that the name field
	contains both an option name and an overriding widget class, in
	the form "class.option".  The lookup for the option value will be
	performed as though the widget class is that specified, rather
	than the actual widget class.
	(SetupStacks): Replaced several lines of array element copying
	with a for loop for conciseness.

2000-05-25  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/button.tcl: Tweaks for -overrelief handling on Windows.

	* library/button.tcl (tkButtonDown, macintosh version): Added
	protection against querying the -repeatdelay option from a widget
	that doesn't support it (ie, checkbuttons, radiobuttons, etc).
	Other platforms use a different binding script for checkbuttons
	and radiobuttons, so they don't have this issue.
	(tkCheckRadioEnter, windows version):  Added code to handle
	-overrelief for check/radiobuttons on windows.

2000-05-22  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkButton.c: Added -activeforeground, -activebackground
	for labels, for the -state option.

	Overall change:  Added "-readonlybackground" option for entries,
	to enable a visual change when state goes to readonly.

	* mac/tkMacDefault.h (DEF_ENTRY_READONLY_BG_COLOR,
	DEF_ENTRY_READONLY_BG_COLOR):
	* win/tkWinDefault.h (DEF_ENTRY_READONLY_BG_COLOR,
	DEF_ENTRY_READONLY_BG_COLOR):
	* unix/tkUnixDefault.h (DEF_ENTRY_READONLY_BG_COLOR,
	DEF_ENTRY_READONLY_BG_COLOR): Added default values for entry
	-readonlybackground option.

	* generic/tkEntry.c: Added -readonlybackground option, cleaned up
	excessive use of graphics contexts.

	* tests/entry.test: Added configuration test for
	-readonlybackground option.

	* doc/entry.n: Added documentation for -readonlybackground option.

	Overall change:  changed implementation of "link" relief for
	buttons.  Instead of a new relief style (-relief link), there is a
	new option, -overrelief, which if set is used when the mouse is
	over the button.

	* doc/SetOptions.3: Added information about TK_OPTION_NULL_OK with
	TK_OPTION_RELIEF.

	* win/tkWinButton.c: Removed bits about TK_RELIEF_LINK.

	* tests/button.test: Added tests for -overrelief; removed tests
	for -relief link.

	TK_RELIEF_LINK.

	* mac/tkMacDefault.h (DEF_BUTTON_OVER_RELIEF): 
	* win/tkWinDefault.h (DEF_BUTTON_OVER_RELIEF): 
	* unix/tkUnixDefault.h (DEF_BUTTON_OVER_RELIEF): Added default
	value for the -overrelief option.

2000-05-16  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (ReconfigureWindowsMenu): Added code to add the
	MF_SEPARATOR bit for SEPARATOR_ENTRY menu items.  This causes
	separator entries on the system menu to be drawn correctly [Bug: 5451].

2000-05-15  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* doc/image.n: Added documentation for [image inuse] command.

	* tests/image.test: Added tests for [image inuse] command.

	* generic/tkImage.c (Tk_ImageObjCmd): Added [image inuse] command,
	which provides a means for programmers to determine if a given
	image is in use by any widgets. [RFE: 3327].

2000-05-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* doc/clipboard.n: Added documentation for "clipboard get".

	* generic/tkClipboard.c (Tk_ClipboardCmd): Added "clipboard get"
	subcommand [RFE: 4628].

	* tests/clipboard.test: Updated to use "clipboard get" instead of
	"selection get -s CLIPBOARD".

	* library/entry.tcl: Adjusted Button-1 binding to set focus to the
	entry when it is readonly or normal.

	* doc/entry.n: Added documentation for readonly state,
	-disabledforeground, -disabledbackground.

	* tests/entry.test: Added tests for readonly state.

	* generic/tkEntry.c: Added support for "readonly" state, and
	redefined "disabled" state.  A disabled entry will display its
	text in a dimmed color and possibly with a different background,
	and will be completely unusable (no selection, no editing).  A
	readonly entry will look like a normal entry, but it will not be
	editable; selection is still allowed. [RFE: 4239].  To support the
	new disabled state properly, "-disabledforeground" and
	"-disabledbackground" options were added.
	*** THIS IS A BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE BEHAVIOR CHANGE ***

	* win/tkWinDefault.h:
	* mac/tkMacDefault.h:
	* unix/tkUnixDefault.h: Added DEF_ENTRY_DISABLED_FG,
	DEF_ENTRY_DISABLED_BG_COLOR, DEF_ENTRY_DISABLED_BG_MONO.

	* mac/tkMacButton.c (TkpDisplayButton, TkpComputeButtonGeometry): 
	* win/tkWinButton.c (TkpDisplayButton, TkpComputeButtonGeometry): 
	Added code for drawing compound buttons.

	error messages are used.

	* generic/tk.h: Changed values of
	TK_OPTION_LINK_OK/TK_CONFIG_LINK_OK for link relief support.

2000-05-12  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinFont.c (LoadFontRanges): improved support for all chars
	in 0-255 range for bitmap ANSI fonts.  May be improved to handle
	bitmap non-ANSI fonts in the future. [Bug: 2172]

	* win/tkWinWm.c (RaiseWinWhenIdle): added TK_DONT_DESTROY_WINDOW
	to flag check to prevent timing related core dump. [Bug: 5438]

2000-05-11  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinTest.c (TestclipboardObjCmd): ensured CloseClipboard
	would always get called for each OpenClipboard.

	* tests/focus.test (focusSetupAlt): removed wm withdraw from proc
	as it would cause a hang for tkwait visibility

	* tests/menu.test:
	* generic/tk3d.c:
	* generic/tkColor.c:
	* generic/tkCursor.c: corrected handling of 3DBorder, Cursor and
	Color objects on multiple screens. [Bug: 5454]

2000-05-09  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* doc/button.n: Added documentation for link relief.

	* tests/button.test: Added tests for link relief for buttons.

	* mac/tkMacButton.c (TkpDisplayButton): 
	* unix/tkUnixButton.c (TkpDisplayButton): Added support for link
	relief. [RFE: 4348]

	* generic/tkOldConfig.c (Tk_ConfigureWidget): 
	* generic/tkConfig.c (DoObjConfig): Added understanding of link
	relief, which is allowed only for widgets that have
	TK_OPTION_LINK_OK or TK_CONFIG_LINK_OK set for the "-relief"
	option. [RFE: 4348]

	* generic/tkButton.c: Added TK_OPTION_LINK_OK to "-relief" option
	for buttons. [RFE: 4348]

	* win/tkWinWm.c (EX_TRANSIENT_STYLE): Removed WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW
	style bit, so that transient windows have full-size titlebars
	(like the tk_getOpenFile dialog).

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (GetMenuSeparatorGeometry): Tweaked height
	requested for separator bars to be (linespace - (2*descent))
	instead of just (linespace); this makes the separator occupy a
	more correct amount of vertical space. [Bug: 5303].

2000-05-09  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* library/focus.tcl: fixed calling of takeFocus proc [Bug: 5372]

2000-04-24  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkImage.c (Tk_PostscriptImage): added check to create
	necessary prolog for photos
	* generic/tkCanvPs.c: added Tk_PostscriptPhoto that outputs PS for
	photo images

2000-04-22  Jim Ingham	<jingham@cygnus.com>

	* mac/tkMacDialog.c (Tk_MacGetOpenFile): Add empty bodies for the 
	"-initialfile" and "-defaultextension" options.

	* mac/tkMacDialog.c (NavServicesGetFile): Only cons the result up
	into a list if multiple is true.

	* mac/tkMacMenus.c (SourceDialog): Use the "tk_getOpenFile"
	instead of hand-coding the dialog with StandardGetFile.  This way
	we get the Navigation dialogs for free.

	* doc/getOpenFile.n: Document the -multiple and -message flags
	which are only implemented on the Mac.  Also note that the -title
	works on the Mac with Nav Services installed.

2000-04-19  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* doc/WinViewable.3: 
	* unix/mkLinks: Removed docs for Tk_IsViewable.

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Removed calls to Tk_IsViewable.

	* generic/tkUtil.c: 
	* generic/tkStubInit.c: 
	* generic/tkDecls.h: 
	* generic/tkCmds.c: 
	* generic/tk.decls: Removed Tk_IsViewable function (it was not
	actually needed).

2000-04-19  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/aclocal.m4: made SC_PROG_TCLSH search specifically for
	tclsh*.exe type files to find an executable.

	* win/Makefile.in: fixed up cleanup, winhelp, cat32 targets

	* library/console.tcl: made console use systemfixed font on Win

	* generic/tkEntry.c: removed unnecessary ENTRY_VALIDATE #define

2000-04-19  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkRectOval.c (ConfigureRectOval): Added checks for valid
	outline settings before creating of outline GC; this means that it
	is really possible now to have an oval or rectangle with no
	outline.  [Bug: 5029].

2000-04-19  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* library/choosedir.tcl (::tk::dialog::file::chooseDir::Config):
	* library/tkfbox.tcl (::tk::dialog::file::Config): removed the
	extraneous glob on -initialdir after file isdir already returned 1
	and moved cd trick into this case as the else already uses [pwd].
	[Bug: 5181]

	* win/winMain.c: moved extern call out of WinMain func

	* README:
	* generic/tk.h:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tk.spec:

	places, realign icon to anchor nw.

	* mac/tkMacScale.c: reverted tkMacScale.c to 1.5 equivalent (it
	was accidentally bumped forward).

2000-04-18  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinPointer.c: Changed Mod2Mask in TkWinGetModifierState to
	ALT_MASK, to fix some event problems [Bugs: 1160, 5088].

	* win/tkWinX.c: Changed Mod2Mask in GetState to ALT_MASK, to fix
	some event problems [Bugs: 1160, 5088].

	* generic/tkInt.h: Moved definition of ALT_MASK and META_MASK here
	so that it would be accessible from other modules than tkBind.c.

	* generic/tkBind.c: Added code in BindEvent to check for ALT_MASK
	and META_MASK in the event state field, as this field may not be
	set up with the correct display modifier mask bits if the XEvent
	structure was created by [event generate] or by the Windows X
	emulation. [Bugs: 1160, 5088].

2000-04-18  Scott Redman  <redman@HILO>

	* win/tk.rc:
	* win/wish.rc:
	* win/wish.ico:  Modified copyright dates in Windows resource
	files.  Updated the icon for wish.exe.

2000-04-17  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Added checks for visibility of parent window
	before creating MessageBox and ChooseColor dialogs; this prevents
	the application from locking when the parent is withdrawn and the
	message box is created.  In these cases, the window will be
	created without a parent.

	* unix/mkLinks: Added WinViewable.3.

	* tests/msgbox.test: Added tests for patch from [Bug: 4997].

	* library/msgbox.tcl: 
	* library/dialog.tcl: Applied patch from [Bug: 4997]; detaches
	dialog window from parent if parent is not viewable.

	* library/bgerror.tcl: Removed workaround from [Bug: 4370]; this
	is superceeded by patches to dialog.tcl.

	* generic/tkCmds.c: Changed WinfoObjCmd to use Tk_IsViewable
	function to determine visibility of windows instead of inlining
	the code.

	* generic/tkStubInit.c: 
	* generic/tkDecls.h: 
	* generic/tk.decls: Added Tk_IsViewable declaration.

2000-04-17  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/text.tcl: Tweaked double-/triple-click selection;
	previously, anchor and insert marks were placed in unexpected
	locations following a double or triple click.  Now they are placed
	logically.  Also tweaked the extension of selection via
	shift-double-clicks so that it no longer selects the contiguous
	whitespace on the side of the selection opposite the
	double-click. [RFE: 4253].

	* doc/menu.n: Added note regarding rendering of
	checkbuttons/radiobuttons in menubars on different platforms --
	some systems do not draw indicators for check/radiobuttons in
	menubars.

	* library/menu.tcl: Corrected behavior of
	checkbuttons/commands/radiobuttons in menubars [Bug: 630].

	* tests/grid.test: Added test for [grid propagate . 0] to not toggle.
	
	* generic/tkGrid.c: Fixed bogus logic in [grid propagate] that
	caused [grid propagate . 0] to act as a toggle instead of an
	absolute set. [Bug: 2286].

2000-04-16  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinColor.c (FindSystemColor): correct calculation of
	colors when shifting value. [Bug: 4919]

2000-04-16  Jim Ingham   <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* mac/tkMacPort.h: protect against strncasecmp already defined -
	it is in the Pro5 version of MSL.

	* mac/tkMacWindowMgr.c (GenerateKeyEvent): Check for a null tkWin.
	If the hidden window we use for double-buffering controls manages
	to percolate to the top (should never happen, but...) this will
	keep us from crashing.

	* mac/tkMacButton.c (InitSampleControls): Hide the
	double-buffering window BEHIND the first "." window you can find.
	This will keep it from ever being the front window, and thus a
	black hole for events.  * mac/tkMacButton.c (ButtonEventProc):
	Disable the controls when the window is in the background.  This
	is required by the MacOS HIG. This doesn't always get called when
	it should, it still needs more work.

	* mac/tkMacDialog.c: Pretty substantial rewrite to include
	Navigation Services support for systems which have it.

2000-04-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinKey.c: Added check for ASCII delete character in
	KeycodeToKeysym, to fix [Bug: 5090].  See comment in code for more
	information.

	* generic/ks_names.h: Added Scroll_Lock and Sys_Req definitions.

	* win/tkWinKey.c: Changed implementation of KeycodeToKeysym,
	et. al., to use a keycode table for lookups; this will result in
	faster keycode -> keysym translations for non-ASCII keys like
	Control, Alt, etc.

2000-04-14  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c (WmProc): added check in WM_MOUSEACTIVATE so we
	correctly activate native menus when clicking in when we didn't
	have focus [Bug: 2272]

	* generic/tkCanvas.c (CanvasEventProc:2451): corrected cast

	* generic/tkEntry.c (Tk_EntryObjCmd): adjusted finishing error
	cases and changed TK_CONFIG_NULL_OK to TK_OPTION_NULL_OK

	* tests/scale.test:
	* generic/tkScale.c:
	* generic/tkScale.h:
	* unix/tkUnixScale.c:
	* mac/tkMacScale.c: moved (PixelToValue|ValueToPixel|SetScaleValue)
	to tkScale.c.  Caused an associated variable to be immediately set
	[Bug: 4833]

	* library/scale.tcl (tkScaleActivate): reduced number of scale
	redisplays by checking current value of state before setting it
	again.  [Bug: 4191]

	* tests/winDialog.test: tk_chooseDirectory seems to get a noop
	from GetOpenFileName in the static build, hanging some tests.
	The tests were fixed to timeout (noop cause unknown).

	* unix/aclocal.m4 (SC_ENABLE_THREADS): enhanced the detection of
	pthread_mutex_init [Bug: 4359] and (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS) added
	--enable-64bit-vis switch for Sparc VIS compilation [Bug: 4995]

2000-04-13  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinKey.c: Added smarts to check whether the left or right
	Control, Shift, or Alt key was pressed.  [Bug: 870].

	* win/tkWinMenu.c: Corrected code that created separator items on
	menus; originally, it requested that the system be responsible for
	drawing those items, so it would ignore configuration items like
	the widget background.  Now, we draw the separators ourselves (as
	we do with every other kind of menu item already). [Bug: 1166].

	* win/tkWin3d.c: 
	* unix/tkUnix3d.c: Applied patch from [RFE: 2501]: adds more
	sophisticated smarts to TkpGetShadows, so that the highlight of a
	very bright color is actually distinguishable from the color, and
	the shadow of a very dark color is similarly distinguishable from
	the color.

	* generic/tkCanvas.c: Applied patch from [Bug: 4202]; adds a check
	for NULL tkwin in Tk_CanvasEventuallyRedraw.

2000-04-12  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* test/winClipboard.test:
	* win/tkWinInt.h:
	* win/tkWinClipboard.c (UpdateClipboard):
	* win/tkWinX.c (GenerateXEvent): added updatingClipboard tsd and
	TkWinUpdatingClipboard accessor function to allow us to flag
	ourselves when we are the ones updating the clipboard.  This
	corrected inability to create our own clipboard types within a Tk
	application.  [Bug: 2338 4318]
	* win/tkWinTest.c (TestclipboardCmd): improved TestclipboardCmd
	with better error handling and obj'ification

2000-04-11  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* msgcat.n: Added docs for new behavior from patch in [Bug: 4158].

	* msgcat.test: Added tests for new behavior from patch in [Bug:
	4158].
	
	* msgcat.tcl: Applied patch from [Bug: 4158], which enables
	msgcat::mc to search the entire namespace ancestry chain for
	message translations (ie, first it checks the current namespace,
	then the parent, then the parent's parent, etc).  Also allows the
	specification of additional args for msgcat::mc; if extra args are
	given, the [format] command is used to substitute the additional
	args in the translated message.

	* library/bgerror.tcl: Moved check for withdrawn state after check
	for tkerror; this was causing problems when tkerror was used.

2000-04-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/bgerror.tcl: Added check for withdrawn state of . and
	unsetting of transient bit for .bgerrorDialog if . is not
	viewable; this protects against the application hanging on systems
	like Windows, where transient windows are withdrawn with their
	parents. [Bug: 4370].

	* tests/event.test: Added test for [event generate $widget
	<Alt-z>] [Bug: 4611].

	* tests/choosedir.test: Changed "namespace import ::tcltest" to
	"namespace import -force ::tcltest".

	* win/tkWinKey.c: 
	* unix/tkUnixKey.c: 
	* mac/tkMacKeyboard.c: Changed InitKeymapInfo to
	TkpInitKeymapInfo. [Bug: 4611].

	* generic/tkStubInit.c: 
	* generic/tkIntDecls.h: Re-gen'd from tkInt.decls.

	* generic/tkInt.decls: Added TkpInitKeymapInfo to list of function
	decls.

	* generic/tkBind.c (HandleEventGenerate): Added code to initialize
	keymap info if necessary, and to correctly set modifier bits in
	XEvent structure create to handle [event generate] calls.
	Previously, the alt/meta bits were not set correctly, so [event
	generate $widget <Alt-z>] would always fail. [Bug: 4611]

2000-04-07  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkGrid.c (InitMasterData): fixed uninit'd data in
	GridMaster struct [Bug: 4387]

	* library/safetk.tcl (disallowTk): made disallowTk work in the
	simple case.

	* library/comdlg.tcl (tkFocusGroup_In): fixed key navigation
	problems in dialogs under CDE [Bug: 2960]

	* tests/winDialog.test: removed knownBug constraint from 5.16

	* win/tkWinFont.c (GetScreenFont): corrected adjustment against
	LC_FACESIZE limitation for NT [Bug: 4931]

	* win/makefile.vc (TKTEST_OBJS):
	* win/Makefile.in (TKTEST_OBJS): moved tkWinTest.c from normal
	objs to TKTEST_OBJS where it belonged.

2000-04-03  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkTest.c: fixed incorrect platform inclusion for
	TkplatformtestInit (it would never get called).

	* unix/Makefile.in (MAN_INSTALL_DIR): patch to accept --mandir
	correctly [Bug: 4085]

	* library/clrpick.tcl (tkColorDialog_Config): error now thrown
	when -initialcolor "" specified. [Bug: 4198]

2000-03-31  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/DrawFocHlt.3: doc name correction

	* generic/tkEntry.c: set TK_OPTION_NULL_OK bit on -invcmd option
	and removed #ifdef ENTRY_VALIDATE expressions

	* library/menu.tcl (tkMenuInvoke): corrected naming of tearoffs
	[Bug: 4506]

	* library/tkfbox.tcl (tkIconList_Goto): caused browsecmd to be
	called in tkIconList_Select.  This causes the entry to be set
	properly when using the type-in-name-in-listbox bindings.

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: added unicode-aware open/save file dialogs

	* win/tkWinFont.c (TkpFontPkgInit): move private ref to platformId
	to TkWinGetPlatformId

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (SetDefaults): moved private use of versionInfo
	to TkWinGetPlatformId and removed all code for
	(versionInfo.dwMajorVersion < 4) (== Win32s)

	* win/tkWinX.c:
	* win/tkWin32Dll.c: moved TkWinGetPlatformId to tkWinX.c
	* win/tkWinInit.c: added TkWinXInit to TkpInit to ensure that its
	called for static Windows shells. [Bug: 3647]

	* win/tkWinInt.h:
	* win/tkWinX.c:
	* win/tkWinDraw.c (SetUpGraphicsPort): 
	* win/tkWinScrlbr.c (UpdateScrollbar): removed use of tkpIsWin32s

	* win/tkWinInt.h (TkWinDCState struct): added bkmode value
	* win/tkWinDraw.c (TkWinGetDrawableDC, et al): added support for
	properly transparent dashed lines on Windows. [Bug: 4617]

2000-03-30  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c: Fixed some ANSI specific bits to avoid
	compile problems with non-ANSI compilers (ie, replace const with
	CONST, etc).  [Bug: 4223].

	* unix/configure.in: Applied patch from [Bug: 4237]; ensures that
	srcdir is fully qualified.

	* unix/Makefile.in: Applied patch from [Bug: 4237]; if tcltest was
	not compiled, make test/tktest failed.  Now it has a rule to build
	tcltest if it has not been built.

2000-03-28  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/tkfbox.tcl: Moved an overlooked tkFDialog* function in
	::tk::dialog::file namespace.

	* tests/unixWm.test: Added tests for memory leak conditions in
	tkUnixWm.c.

	* tests/canvas.test: Added test for bad configuration options on
	empty and non-empty canvas.

	* generic/tkCanvas.c: Removed bad code in CANV_CONFIGURE block of
	CanvasWidgetCmd; this was causing non-empty canvases to improperly
	handle bad configuration options [Bug: 4456].

2000-03-27  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c: Applied patch from [Bug: 4405]; fixes memory
	leak in Unix wm command.

2000-03-24  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/filebox.test: 
	* tests/choosedir.test: Updated tests.

	* library/xmfbox.tcl: Updated to stash data array in
	::tk::dialog::file namespace instead of in global namespace.

	* library/tkfbox.tcl: Extended some functions to support creation
	of a choosedir dialog, to allow greater code reuse between the two
	dialogs.  Moved tkFDialog* functions into a namespace
	(::tk::dialog::file).  Because these are private Tk functions (and
	should thus not be used directly by users), this should not impact
	anybody (the tk_getOpenFile and tk_getSaveFile commands still
	exist at the global scope).

	* library/tk.tcl: 
	* library/tclIndex: Updated function names for tkFDialog*
	functions and choosedir functions.

	* library/choosedir.tcl: New and improved implementation of
	tk_chooseDirectory dialog.  Based on tk_getOpenFile dialog.

2000-03-23  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkWindow.c: 
	* generic/tkInt.h: Updated Tcl_OptionCmd -> Tcl_OptionObjCmd

	* generic/tkOption.c: Tcl_Obj'ectified the "option" command.

2000-03-22  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/listbox.tcl (tkListboxCancel): Added a check for empty
	string value for tkPriv(listboxPrev).  Without this check, it's
	possible to get a stack trace under certain conditions. [Bug: 4373].

2000-03-15  Sven Delmas  <sven@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Changed the behavior for the
	tk_chooseDirectory dialog under Windows. Instead of trying to
	return the currently selected listbox entry (which didn't work in
	case the user selected the initial directory anyway), we now
	return the value shown in the entry. This seems to be in
	accordance with the expected behavior for this dialog.

2000-03-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/choosedir.test: Marked test 3.1 and 3.2 as bad until the
	issue with those tests on IRIX can be determined.

2000-03-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/menu.tcl: Applied patch from [Bug: 4155]; protects
	against grabs on non-viewable windows.

2000-03-08  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/choosedir.test: Modified test 3.1 (-mustexist works) to be
	more careful about cleaning up its potentially troublesome after 
	events.

2000-03-07  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/button.test: 
	* generic/tkButton.c: Added -disabledforeground/-state to labels.

2000-03-07  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/entry.test:
	* generic/tkEntry.c (EntrySetValue): malloc the value when
	validating because validation could cause the pointer to become
	invalid.  Also fixed configure to not trigger focus-based
	validation.  Improved use of Tcl_WrongNumArgs. [Bug: 4320]

2000-03-06  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/menu.tcl: Added a check in tkMenuFirstEntry that changes
	menu behavior to only auto-post an immediate child cascade if we
	are currently on a menubar menu.  This prevents massive
	auto-cascading in cases where the first entry of the cascade is
	itself a cascade, and the first entry of that cascade is a
	cascade, and the first entry of that cascade is a cascade
	... [Bug: 676].

	* generic/tkOldConfig.c: Added check for NULL tkwin value in
	Tk_ConfigureWidget [Bug: 4079]

	* generic/tkWindow.c: Added check for NULL tkwin value in
	Tk_NameToWindow [Bug: 4079]

2000-03-02  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/color.test:
	* xlib/xcolors.c (XParseColor FindColor):
	* win/tkWinColor.c (XAllocColor): Fixed bit fiddling for colors to
	return "correct" values for color mapping. [Bug: 4282]

	* unix/Makefile.in (SCRIPT_INSTALL_DIR): removed extraneous '/'
	* unix/aclocal.m4: corrected TCL_NEEDS_EXP_FILE to be 1 for AIX

	* win/tkWinInt.h: change extern to EXTERN for TkWinChildProc
	declaration with extra #defs. [Bug: 4240]

	* library/focus.tcl: fixed tkFocusOK to protect $w in
	uplevel with list. [Bug: 4208]

	* doc/CrtItemType.3: fixed docs for Tk_CreateItemType to reflect
	changes made in 8.3.0 (but old style would still work as well).
	[Bug: 4252]

	* tests/config.test: extra test to check object cleanup when
	destroying the widget
	* generic/tkListbox.c (DestroyListbox): fixed crash in
	DestroyListbox due to null tkwin.  [Bug: 4207]

	* tests/entry.test: added test suite for entry validation
	* doc/entry.n: improved docs discussing caveats and gotchas when
	mixing textvar with widget validation
	* generic/tkEntry.c (EntryValidateChange): improved handling of
	validation with relation to -textvariable.  Previously, it would
	turn off whenever the textvar was set.  Now it will it will turn
	off only when the textvar is set and validation returns 0.  Added
	%V (type of validation occuring) to %-subs to help work with
	trickier validation.

2000-03-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/clrpick.test: 
	* library/clrpick.tcl: Added code to make color chooser dialog
	inherit screen setting from parent (bug #2334)

2000-02-25  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c (RaiseWinWhenIdle): Checked for the possibility
	that the window could be destroyed (can occur with
	wm deiconify .toplevel; destroy .toplevel).

2000-02-25  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c: Applied "spirit of" the patch in 1605 (the
	submitted patch was more complicated than necessary and did not
	extend to writing GIF's, only reading), to allow reading/writing
	of GIF files on EBCDIC and other non-ASCII based systems.

2000-02-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tk.spec: RPM specification for producing a binary Tk RPM
	for Linux.

	* unix/Makefile.in: Added rpm target to generate Tk
	binary RPM.

2000-02-10  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	8.3.0 RELEASE

	* changes: updated for 8.3.0 release

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c (FileReadGIF): added cast for trashBuffer

	* generic/tkIntXlibDecls.h:
	* generic/tkInt.decls: declared some Xlib emulation calls for
	the Mac

	* generic/tkFrame.c (TkInstallFrameMenu): added extra panic to
	inform user of bad call when framePtr is NULL [Bug: 2530]

	* generic/tkMenu.c (DestroyMenuInstance): Placed checks around
	menu name objects before trying to incr the ref.  [Bug: 3402]

	* generic/tkTest.c: removed USE_OLD_IMAGE def for Mac

	* library/listbox.tcl:
	* library/text.tcl: added support for <4> and <5> for mousewheel
	style scrolling on Unix for mice that map to these buttons.

	* tests/scrollbar.test: fixed check of testmetrics command to
	allow unix tests to run (testmetrics is mac/pc only)

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (Tk_CoordsToWindow): qualified delete of error
	handler as the goto label is reached from above and below.

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/aclocal.m4: cleaned up macros to coincide with tcl.m4,
	added -export-dynamic to LDFLAGS for FreeBSD-3+ [Bug: 2998]

	* unix/README:
	* unix/Makefile.in (dist): removed porting.notes and porting.old
	from distribution and CVS.  The information was very outdated.  Now
	refer to http://dev.scriptics.com/services/support/platforms.html

	* xlib/xgc.c: #def'd out XDrawSegments for the Mac, and added
	some extra include info for the Mac

2000-02-09  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* mac/tkMacButton.c: Stop removing the appearance window from the
	Window List.  It is not clear why Ray did this, and it causes the
	Appearance manager to crash at random times.
	
	* mac/tkMacWM.c: Add support in unsupported1 style for the Appearance
	specification of window styles, including floating window support.
	* mac/tkMacWindowMgr.c: Operate on the front non-floating window,
	unless the mouse is directly over the floating window.  Also,
	keystrokes go to the front non-floating window.
	* mac/tkMacAppInit.c: Initialize floating window support.
	* mac/tkMacScrlbr.c:
	* mac/tkMacmenu.c: Fixes for floating windows - operate on the 
	FrontNonFloatingWindow.
	* mac/tkMacLibrary.r: Fix typo in File info string.
	* mac/tkMacApplication.r: Fix typo in file info string.  Add
	Finder balloon help for no apparent reason.
	
	* mac/tkMacSubwindows.c: Change panic in tkMacGetDrawablePort to
	Debugger.  This is only a temporary fix.  The panic is only
	triggered when a safeTk interpreter is torn down, and ignoring it
	does no harm.  I haven't figured out how to avoid it yet, however.
	Also use the Appearance MoveWindowStructure call when available.
	
	New Files:
	* MW_TkOldImageHeader.h: Handle #defining USE_OLD_IMAGE for tkImgPPM.c.
	* MW_TkTestHeader.h:
	* MW_TkTestHeader.pch:
	* MW_TkHeader.h: Add separate prefix files for test & release
	versions of Tk, so we can just have separate targets w/o having to
	edit files.
	
	* tclets.r: The D&D Tclets icon in rez form so we can have a
	target for this.

	The above are curtesy of Daniel Steffen (steffen@math.mq.edu.au)
	
	* tkMacAppearanceStubs.c: Stubs of the Mac Appearance calls I use
	so I can link the static 68K Shell without putting ifdef's all
	over the code.

	* generic/tk.decls:
	* generic/tkBind.c:
	* generic/tkInt.decls:
	* generic/tkIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tkStubInit.c:
	* mac/tkMacKeyboard.c:
	* unix/tkUnixKey.c:
	* win/tkWinKey.c: Fix for keyboard handling of "dead" keys and
	caps lock from Peter Spjuth. [Bug: 4105 3359 2493]
	Split functions into platform specific files:
	Static functions GetKeySym(), SetKeycodeAndState() and InitKeymapInfo()
	from tkBind.c moved into platform files tkWinKey.c tkUnixKey.c and
	tkMacKeyboard.c.  GetKeySym() and SetKeycodeAndState() renamed to 
	Tkp* and made public (as private functions) in tkInt.decls.

	Step 2, fixes in tkWinKey.c
	New static function: KeycodeToKeysym(), based on XKeycodeToKeysym()
	but with different arguments, and a lot of improvements.
	TkpGetString() changed to use KeycodeToKeysym() + other fixes.
	TkpGetKeySym() changed to use KeycodeToKeysym() + other fixes.
	InitKeymapInfo() changed to use KeycodeToKeysym().
	TkpSetKeycodeAndState() rewritten, mostly by copying code from
	XKeysymToKeycode().
	XKeycodeToKeysym() rewritten. Preferably it should be removed.

	EXPLANATION: The main problem is ToAscii() which has a lot of side
	effects, and also that XKeycodeToKeysym() is not provided enough
	input to do a proper job.  The changes' main goal is to avoid
	calling ToAscii() if not necessary, and to provide it with as
	correct information as possible when called.  Also some attempts
	to clean up what ToAscii() did are done.  See the code for details.

	BUGS FIXED: Typing shifted (and AltGr) dead keys did not work.
	Keyboard lock lamps did not work on Win98.
	Events regarding AltGr-keys behaved badly.
	Example: On a Swedish keyboard, $ is typed with AltGr-4.
	That keyboard event would get the keysym '4' not 'dollar'.
	Also, doing [event generete . <Key-dollar>] would send keysym '4'.
	Translation to ascii in TkpGetString did not handle return and
	tab correctly. I.e. [event generate . <Key-Return>] gave wrong %A

	* generic/tkDecls.h:
	* generic/tk.decls:
	* generic/tk.h: moved new public functions created in dash patch
	to the stubs interface [Bug: 4062]

	* generic/tk.h: 
	* doc/CrtImgType.3:
	* doc/CrtPhImgFmt.3:
	* generic/tk.h:
	* generic/tkImgGIF.c:
	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c:
	* generic/tkStubImg.c (new file):
	* generic/tkTest.c:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc: improved support for moving from the old style
	image C API to the new obj'ified one with new Tk_InitImageArgs
	command and stub'ing of image code.  See docs for how to make the
	transition. [Bug: 4060]

	* library/tk.tcl: wrapped check for tcl_platform(os) around info
	exists because it won't in safe interpreters

	* win/tkWinFont.c: corrected symbol font use to only work on 8-bit
	characters [Bug: 2406]

	* unix/aclocal.m4: changed all -fpic to -fPIC

	* README:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* win/configure.in:
	* generic/tk.h (TK_RELEASE_SERIAL): Moved to 8.3.0 patchlevel

2000-02-07  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/tkfbox.tcl: Applied patch from bug #4117,
	tk_getOpenFile/getSaveFile doesn't do the right thing when user
	types a directory name in the entry and a default extension is
	specified.

2000-02-05  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tkUnixScale.c (TkpDestroyScale): changed ckfree to
	Tcl_EventuallyFree to behave with Tcl_Preserve in TkpDisplayScale
	(prevents possible segfault).

2000-02-03  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/canvText.test: test for fix for bug #2525.

	* generic/tkFont.c (Tk_ComputeTextLayout): Was erroneously setting
	the width of newline-only text display chunks to some arbitrary
	huge number, instead of 0; this was interfering with things like
	the canvas find enclosed feature. (bug #2525).

	* tests/text.test: 
	* generic/tkText.c (DumpLine/DumpSegment): Changed DumpSegment to
	take a TkTextIndex instead of two integer offsets, so that it
	could use TkTextPrintIndex to format the offsets into an index,
	which makes it UTF smart (bug #2582).

2000-02-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/tk.tcl: 
	* library/tclIndex: 
	* library/choosedir.tcl: Moved choosedir functions into the
	::tk::dialog::chooseDir namespace instead of a toplevel
	::tkChooseDirectory namespace.  Additional cleanup on the
	chooseDir dialog.

2000-02-01  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/text.n: clarified docs on what happens during a search with
	-count when images/windows are embedded

	* win/Makefile.in (install-*): reduced verbosity of install

	* win/tkWinPixmap.c (XGetGeometry): added support for windows in
	XGetGeometry [Bug: 4069]

	* win/tkWinFont.c (GetScreenFont): fixed possible mem overrun with
	long font names [Bug: 4108]

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: added EnableWindow calls to dialogs to
	correct for possible loss of control in parent Tk toplevel
	[Bug: 1212 et al]

	* generic/tkRectOval.c (ConfigureRectOval): 
	* generic/tkCanvLine.c (ConfigureLine):

	* library/text.tcl: fixed double-click selection behavior where
	there were embedded windows/widgets in the same line. [Bug: 3989]

	* win/tkWinWm.c (TkWmProtocolEventProc): cached atom name as the
	window could get destroyed during eval [Bug: 2513]

	coords were passed to a line with certain options set (it should
	always have thrown an error anyway). [Bug: 4042]

	* tests/grid.test: Added a test for the consecutive ^ and multiple
	widget case (bug #1386).

	characters in grid command.  Previously, ^ ^ was interpreted as
	meaning that there must be a 2-column widget above to extend,
	neglecting the case where there was actually 2 1-column widgets
	above.  Now, ^ ^ is interpreted as a possible width; the gridder
	will consume as many ^'s as there are columns in the widget, and
	leave the rest for the extension of other widgets.  (bug #1386).

2000-01-19  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* TK 8.2.0 RELEASED

1999-08-13  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* mac/tkMacMenu.c: Tk_DrawChars ends up setting the menu background
	wrong.	There is no clean way to stop it, so I use lower level routines
	here to draw the text.
	* mac/tkMacProjects.sea.hqx: Rearrange the projects so that the build 
	directory is separate from the sources.  Much more convenient! 

1999-08-10  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	Also added runtest target.

1999-07-29    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkConsole.c: Allow tcl to open CON and NUL, even for std
	channels.  Checking for bad/unusable std channels was moved to Tk

	Window for the std channels.  [Bug: 2393 2392 2209 2458]

	* win/Makefile.in: Corrected building threaded tktest.exe on
	Windows.  Needed to link in .obj files from Tcl, needs to change

	tkStubLib.obj is built with -DSTATIC_BUILD.

	* win/tkWinX.c (TkWinChildProc): Changed to pass
	WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED through to DefWindowProc to make OpenGL
	sub-windows happy.  This allows Windows to generate the WM_SIZE
	and WM_MOVE messages.

1999-07-08    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in: Fix Tk stub lib file names and flags.

1999-06-30    <redman@scriptics.com>

	has not been initialized in TkWinWmCleanup.  [Bug: 2269]
	
1999-06-16    <wart@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/aclocal.m4: Numerous build changes to make Tk conform to
	the proposed TEA spec

	* tkConsole.c: changed some variable types from (int) to (size_t)
	to prevent compiler warnings.  Cast return value from strlen()
	to (int) in one place for the same reason.

	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c: 
	* tests/unixSelect.test: 
	* generic/tkSelect.c: Fixed selection code to handle Unicode data

1999-06-02    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkIntXlibDecls.h: 
	* xlib/X11/Xlib.h: Added Mac specific defines to help with
	compilation. 

	* generic/tkFont.c: lint

1999-06-01    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c: Improved I18N selection support.
	COMPOUND_TEXT is converted to/from iso2022, and STRING is
	converted to/from iso8859-1.  There are still a few loose ends to
	tie up before this is completely done.

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c: Eliminated redundant case folding code.

	* generic/tkFont.c: Eliminated use of isupper/tolower in favor of
	Unicode variants.

	Scriptics Corp. in wish console about box.
	
1999-05-19    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tk.h: Add extern "C" block around entire header file for
	C++ compilers to fix linkage issues.  Submitted by Don Porter and
	Paul Duffin.

1999-05-18    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/winClipboard.test: 
	* win/tkWinClipboard.c: Fixed clipboard code so it handles Unicode

	* generic/tkIntPlatDecls.h: 
	* generic/tkIntXlibDecls.h: 
	* generic/tkPlatDecls.h: 
	* generic/tkStubInit.c: Changed to avoid the need for forward
	declarations in stub initializers.  Added extern "C" blocks around
	stub table pointer declarations so the stubs can be used from C++
	code. [Bug: 1934]

	* generic/tkInt.decls: Added TkClipBox, XDrawSegments, and
	XForceScreenSaver to stubs.

1999-04-20    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* xlib/X11/Xlib.h: changed definition of Status type to use a
	typedef instead of a #define to avoid conflicting with the cygwin
	win32 headers [Bug 1804]

1999-04-15    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* Merged 8.1 branch into the main trunk

1999-04-09    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkWindow.c: Fixed deadlock situation when the Initialize()
	function returns without releasing the mutex.  Found while testing
	Bug 1700, during safe.test (tk).

1999-04-06    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkMain.c (Tk_MainEx): Changed to reset result before
	calling Tcl_EvalFile.  The ensures that error messages will be
	generated cleanly.

	* tests/winfo.test: Enabled tests that previously failed.

1999-04-05    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* library/tk.tcl: Lots of minor performance improvements
	contributed by Jeffrey Hobbs. [Bug: 1118]

	* win/tkWinWm.c (Tk_WmCmd): Fixed bad code in tracing
	suboption. [Bug: 1519]

	* library/tkfbox.tcl: Change to restore button text after an
	action to avoid the sticky "Open" button in a save dialog.
	[Bug: 1640]

	* library/entry.tcl: Fixed so selection is returned using the
	-show character during cut and paste operations. [Bug: 1687]
	
1999-04-5     <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkInt.decls:

	* generic/tkStubInit.c:
	* xlib/xgc.c:
	* xlib/X11/Xlib.h:

	tables.
	
1999-04-05    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in:
	* generic/tkCanvPs.c: Added configure test for pw_gecos field in
	pwd to support OS/390. [Bug: 1724]

1999-04-02    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/text.test: 
	* generic/tkText.c: Fixed handling of Unicode in text searches.
	The -count option was returning byte counts instead of character
	counts. [Bug: 1056, 1148, 1666]

1999-04-01    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tk.decls:
	* generic/tk.h:
	* generic/tkStubInit.c:
	* generic/tkWindow.c:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc: Tk now uses its own stub library to store
	pointers to its own stubs table.

	* doc/dde.n: (removed)
	* doc/send.n:
	* generic/tk.decls:
	* tests/winSend.test:
	* generic/tkPlatDecls.h:
	* win/tkWinSend.c:  Removed the DDE-based send and dde commands,
	they were causing Tk to lock up when any window on the system was
	not processing its message queue (more importantly, windows in Tcl
	and Tk).  The send command needs to be rewritten to prevent the
	deadlock situation (soon).  The dde command is being pushed into
	its own package and will provide almost all of the capabilities
	that send did before (using a "dde eval" command), not yet
	completed.

1999-03-31    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinSend.c: Modified dde/send code to work properly on
	Win95/Win98. String lengths are not returned properly by DDE, so
	NULL terminate all strings going in and ignore the string length
	coming back out.  Do not destroy handles until all necessary work
	on those handles (and child handles) is done.

1999-03-30    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Tk_DestroyWindow): Image handlers are now
	finalized before the font subsystem since complex image handlers
	may contain references to fonts (e.g. Tix compound images).
	[Bug: 1603]

1999-03-29    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* doc/MeasureChar.3:

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c: 
	* unix/tkUnixMenu.c: 
	* win/tkWinFont.c: 
	* win/tkWinMenu.c: Standardized text layout and font interfaces
	so they are consistent with respect to byte versus character
	oriented indices.  The layout functions all manipulate character
	oriented values while the lower level measurement functions all
	operate on byte oriented values.  This distinction was not clear
	and so the functions were being used improperly in a number of
	places.  [Bug: 1053, 747, 749, 1646]

	* generic/tk.decls: Eliminated uses of C++ STL types string and
	list from declarations.

	* generic/tkFont.c: Changes to named fonts were not being
	propagated in some cases. [Bug: 1144]
	
	* xlib/X11/Xlib.h:
	* generic/tkInt.decls: Added XParseColor to xlib stub
	tables. [Bug: 1574] 

	* doc/GetBitmap.3: 
	* generic/tkBitmap.c (BitmapInit): Eliminated use of Tk_Uid's in
	bitmaps.  Added a few CONST declarations.

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/Makefile.in:

	* generic/tkIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tkIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tkPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tkIntXlibDecls.h: Removed stub functions. Always use the
	Tcl stubs when building with --enable-shared.
	

1999-03-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkTextIndex.c:
	* tests/testIndex.test: Avoid looking past the beginning of the
	array storing data for the text widget (.t index end-2c).  Added
	test case to check for the bug.  [Bug 991]
	
	* generic/tkConsole.c: Copy static strings into a Tcl_DString
	before passing to Tcl_Eval, in case the compiler puts static
	strings into read-only memory.

1999-03-26    <suresh@scriptics.com>
	
	* unix/configure.in:
	--nameble-shared is now the default and builds Tk as a shared
	library; specify --disable-shared to build a static Tk library
	and shell.

1999-03-26    <surles@scriptics.com>

	* library/menu.tcl: Fixed bug reported by Bryan Oakley in the
	menubutton bindings.  There was a false assumption that there was
	always a menu attached to the button.  [Bug 1116] 

1999-03-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in: Removed --enable-tcl-stub.  Linking Tk to Tcl
 	stubs is causing too many problems when linking executables like wish.
  	Until the Tk is a fully loadable extension, linking against the Tcl
 	stubs is not supported in Tk.

1999-03-19    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkBitmap.c:
	* generic/tkCursor.c:
	* generic/tkGC.c: When creating hash tables that key off of XID
 	handles, make sure to pass TCL_ONE_WORD_KEYS.  XIDs are guaranteed
 	to be 32bit numbers, although on some 64bit systems (including 64bit
 	Solaris 7) they are packed into a 64bit value where the upper 32bits
 	are zero. The normal method of sizeof(XID)/sizeof(int) causes the
 	hash table code to assume that the XID is a pointer to an array of 
	two ints, which it is not.  Tk now supports 64bit Solaris 7.

1999-03-17    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: 
	* generic/tk.h: Changed to use TCL_BETA_RELEASE macro, and fixed
	so this works in rc files.
	
	* win/makefile.vc: 
	* win/makefile.bc: 
	* win/README: 
	* unix/configure.in:

	* unix/Makefile.in: Install tkDecls.h in addition to tk.h.

	* generic/tkStubLib.c: Added flags to ensure we are using Tcl
	stub macros.

1999-03-11    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkInt.decls: Added reserved slot for XSetDashes for use
	by the dash patch.

	* unix/tkUnixMenubu.c: Stubs implementation for 8.1.  Tk_Main() is
	replaced with a macro which calls Tk_MainEx(). Tk can link to the Tcl
	stubs library, wish links directly to Tcl and Tk. Use
	--enable-tcl-stubs to link Tk to the Tcl stubs library (Unix), on
	by default on Windows. Exported all public functions through the
	stubs mechanism (see the *.decls files) and many of the internal
	functions. Most of the changes dealt with shifting around the
	function declarations in the header files.  Mac code may not
	compile, but it shouldn't take much work to fix this.
	
	* mac/tkMacMenu.c: Added dummy TkpMenuThreadInit for Mac to be
	consistent with Unix and Windows versions.

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Toplevel class no longer shared between 
	threads.
	
	* win/tkWinX.c: Multiple threads no longer share the same
	TkDisplay structure.  Required because TkDisplay stores much
	thread-specific data for a given thread.

	* win/tkWinSend.c: Moved application instance handle out
	out thread-local storage.  DDE was failing to initialize
	when the instance handles were different between threads.
	
	* win/makefile.vc: Added THREADDEFINES for building with
	threads enabled.
	
	* generic/tkMenu.c:
	* win/tkWinMenu.c:
	* unix/tkUnixMenu.c: Added TkpMenuThreadInit for initializing
	thread-specific Menu state.

1999-03-01    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c: 
	* win/tkWinPointer.c:
	* win/tkWinInt.h: Fix "focus -force" for Windows.  The Win32 API
	function SetForegroundWindow() does not work unless the window
	handle is a toplevel window (a Windows toplevel).  The handle
	being passed was a Tk toplevel, which is a child of the Windows
	toplevel.

1999-02-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/cat.c: Remove this file, use the one in the Tcl source directory.

	* win/makefile.vc: Remove the wishc.exe from the default targets.  Add
	a separate console-wish target to build it.  The need for a 
	console-wish will go away soon, so we don't want to encourage its
	use.

1999-02-25    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Properly initialize the tsdPtr->firstWindow field.
	
	* win/cat.c: Code for cat32.exe, copied from the Tcl sources. Required
	in order to run the test suite from the makefile

	* win/winMain.c: Add main() for a console-based wishc.exe, which meant
	adding code to disable the call to Tk_ConsoleInit().
	
	* generic/tkConsole.c: Check the standard handles before creating the
	new standard channels.	This allows a windows app that has stdin,
	stdout, or stderr to correctly connect to them.
	
	* generic/tkMain.c: Add a proper check for the interactive mode, since
	the standard channels may actually be connected in windows mode or
	even in the console-based wish.
	
	* win/makefile.vc: Add targets for wishc.exe (console-based wish) and
	cat32.exe (for testing). Fix the test suite target so it can be run
	from the makefile (which can happen since the standard handles have
	been fixed).

1999-02-12    <lfb@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkMenuButton.h:
	* generic/tkMenuButton.c:
	* mac/tkMacMenubutton.c:
	* mac/tkMacDefault.h
	* unix/tkUnixMenubu.c: Eliminated Tk_Uids used by -state option.
	* unix/tkUnixDefault.h
	* win/tkWinDefault.h
	

	* generic/tk.h:

	* unix/tkUnixDefault.h:
	* unix/tkWinDefault.h:
	* mac/tkMacDefault.h:  Objectified scale widget.

	* win/tkWinX.c: Removed Thread-specific data from process
	initialization code that was stopping the Tk Dll from 
	loading.

1999-02-11    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* README:
	* generic/tk.h: 
	* unix/configure.in:
	* win/README:
	* win/makefile.bc:
	* win/makefile.vc: Updated version to 8.1b2.
	
	* unix/tkUnixSend.c: Fixed one more Tcl_*ObjVar instance.
	
1999-02-04    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* Various cleanup related to the Tcl_Eval and Tcl_ObjSetVar
	changes in Tcl.
	
	INTEGRATED PATCHES FROM 8.0.5b2: 
	
	* win/tkWinMenu.c (TkpDestroyMenu): Changed so modalMenuPtr is
	cleared when it is being destroyed.

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c: Changed so color tables are freed
	immediately instead of being delayed.  This ensures that color
	tables are properly disposed at process exit.

	* library/prolog.ps: Changed string that determines font height to
	include European character with an umlaut.

	* generic/tkImgBmap.c (ImgBmapConfigureInstance): If an image
	mask changed but ended up with the same XID, the GC failed to be
	updated and so the new mask was not used. [Bug: 970]

	* generic/tkFocus.c (SetFocus): Changed so focus window is always
	set if -force is specified.  This fixes the problem on Windows
	where Tk does not activate the window if it already has focus.

	* generic/tkConsole.c: Fixed so errors in console eval are
	reported properly.  Eliminated duplicate result messages. [Bug: 973]

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Changed so windows that aren't resizable don't
	have resize handles and the zoom box is disabled.

	* win/tkWinInt.h:
	* win/tkWinPointer.c: Changed to cancel the mouse timer when a
	user initiated move/resize loop begins.

	* unix/configure.in: TK_LD_SEARCH_FLAGS was set incorrectly if
	SHLIB_LD_LIBS='${LIBS}', and shared linking is performed through
	the C compiler. Systems affected are Linux, MP-RAS and NEXTSTEP,
	but also with gcc on many more systems. [Bug: 908]

	* win/makefile.vc: First stab at install target.  Fixed quoting so
	paths with spaces work.
	
	* tests/main.test:
	* tests/unixWm.test: Better cleanup of temporary files.
	
	* mac/tkMacAppInit.c:
	* generic/tkTest.c:
	* generic/tkAppInit.c:
	* win/winMain.c: Changed some EXTERN declarations to extern
	since they are not defining exported interfaces.  This avoids
	generating useless declspec() attributes and makes the windows
	makefile simpler.

	* library/menu.tcl (tkMenuFind): Changed so keyboard shortcuts
	will only be found in the current toplevel.  Previously, they
	might be found in menus attached to other toplevels that might not
	even be mapped. [Bug: 924]

	* generic/tkCanvLine.c: Changed to treat zero width lines like
	they have width 1 for purposes of selection. [Bug: 925]

	* win/tkWinFont.c (Tk_MeasureChars): Added a workaround for a bug
	in GetTextExtentExPoint on Win NT 4.0/Japanese. [Bug: 1006]

	* unix/tkUnixSend.c (Tk_SetAppName): Fixed uninitialized memory
	access bug. [Bug: 919]

1999-1-28    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkGrid.c: Fixed bug in "grid forget" that failed to cancel
	pending idle handlers, resulting in a crash in a few odd cases.

1999-01-06  <lfb@JUSTICE>

	* generic/tk.h, generic/tkGet.c, generic/tkConfig.c, 
	* generic/tkOldConfig.c, generic/tkEntry.c, generic/tkMenubutton.c, 
	* generic/tkMenubutton.h, generic/tkScale.c, generic/tkScale.h, 
	* generic/tkTextDisplay.c, generic/tkText.c, unix/tkUnixMenubu.c, 
	* unix/tkUnixScale.c, mac/tkMacMenu.c, mac/tkMacMenubutton.c, 
	
	Removed global Tk_Uids dealing with "-state" configuration option
	and added new TK_CONFIG_STATE configSpec that doesn't use 
	Tk_Uids.

1998-12-11    === Tk 8.1b1 Release ===
	
1998-12-11    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkMain.c (Tk_Main): Fixed improper command line encoding
	handling. 

1998-12-08    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* win/tkWinClipboard.c (TkSelGetSelection, TkWinClipboardRender):
	Changed to handle multibyte characters properly. [Bug: 935]

1998-12-07    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* library/xmfbox.tcl (tkMotifFDialog_Create): In the cached case,
	the data array was not being initialized with the correct set of
	widgets.

1998-12-4    <welch@SAGE>

	* Changed patchLevel to 8.1b1

	* generic/tkMenu.c (ConfigureMenuCloneEntries): The -menu configuration
	option was being incorrectly specified as just "menu". 

1998-11-30    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkButton.c (ConfigureButton): The error result was
	getting lost when restoring configuration options. [Bug: 619]

1998-11-25    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (GetFontAttributes): Initialize an unspecified
	family to an empty string.
	(FontMapLoadPage): if the font included characters below 32, the
	index computation was incorrect because the range was shifted up
	to 32.
	(CreateClosestFont): check for empty locale as well as NULL.

	* generic/tkFont.c (TkFontParseXLFD): initialize charset to
	iso8859-1 if no charset is specified.

	* mac/tkMacHLEvents.c (OdocHandler): added conversion from
	external string to UTF [Bug: 869]

	* integrated tk8.0.4 changes.
	
	* generic/tkBind.c: fixed deletion order bug where a crash would
	result if a binding deleted "."

	* generic/tkMenu.c (MenuWidgetObjCmd): disabled menu entries were
	getting reenabled whenever the mouse passed over the entry [Bug: 860]

	* unix/tkUnixMenu.c (TkpComputeStandardMenuGeometry): hidemargin
	option was not honored properly in menus [Bug: 859]

1998-11-24    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tkMacMenu.c, tkUnixMenu.c, tkWinMenu.c, tkMenuDraw.c, tkMenu.h,
	* tkMenu.c: Backed out the previous fix for bug 620 and
	eliminated a bunch of code that created unnecessary objects.
	Changed back to using internal types instead of objects for many
	configuration options.	There are many more fixes like this that
	could be made, but some require a little restructuring of the
	code. In any case the leaks are fixed and there is a lot less
	allocation happening. [Bug: 620]

1998-11-19    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tkMenu.c (DestroyMenuEntry): fixed memory leaks [Bug: 620]
	
	* tkWinX.c (GetTranslatedKey): fixed bad code merge

	* tkWinWm.c, tkWinMenu.c: fixed titles and menus so they properly
	display Unicode [Bug: 819]
