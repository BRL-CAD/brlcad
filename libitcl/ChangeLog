		Previously, one could build Itcl against 8.4 and load into any core 8.1+.  Now

			instead.  Changed a few Tcl_GetStringFromObj() calls to Tcl_GetString()
			when a length int* isn't used.

		  Tcl's internal header, tclInt.h, in 8.4a2 got a small change in the Command
		  structure that needed 2 changes in Itcl to resolve.  1) #if/#else/#endif blocks
		  added in itcl_class.c and itc_ensemble.c allowing Itcl to compile. 2) added
		  a global variable called itclCompatFlags that's sets a flag in Itcl_Init()
		  that will modify the logic around access to cmdPtr->flags/deleted.  This
		  way, any core compile will yeild a fully forward/backward compatible
		  binary (correct logic set at runtime).

	* itcl/win/dllEntryPoint.c:
		a small windows specific fix against Tcl's Stubs library.

2000-08-18  davidg
	* itcl/generic/itcl_cmds.c:
		Tcl_InitStubs was using the TCL_VERSION macro set by the tcl.h header.
		Changed it to be "8.1" instead as it doesn't matter unless Itcl needs
		special/new features of the core it's header is from.  But it doesn't..  so hard
		code it for an 8.1 minimum.

		6/26/00 (bug fix)
		  Fixed Itcl_ClassVarResolver so that the formal parameters in a
		  method/proc take precedence over class data members.
		
		6/30/00 (bug fix)
		  Fixed all itcl/itk/iwidgets3.0.0 tests to run cleanly with the new
		  tcltest package.
		
		7/1/00 (bug fix)
		  Fixed "itk_component delete" so that the composite option list is
		  cleaned up whenever a component is deleted.  For example, suppose
		  a component is the sole contributor of -font.  When that component
		  is removed via "itk_component delete", the -font option goes away
		  as well.  Also fixed the handling of the itk-delete-* binding for
		  the component.  When the component is removed, the binding tag
		  is also removed by itk::remove_destroy_hook.
		
		7/5/00 (bug fix)
		  Fixed the check done during object creation to avoid clobbering
		  existing commands.  Previously, itcl would look for any command--
		  in the local *and* global namespace--that might be clobbered.
		  Now, it looks for commands only in the local namespace, since
		  those are the only ones that could truly be clobbered.
		
		7/5/00 (cleanup)
		  Removed obsolete Makefile/configure files in the various "unix"
		  directories.  Makefiles and configure files now reside one level
		  above, in the standard TEA place.
