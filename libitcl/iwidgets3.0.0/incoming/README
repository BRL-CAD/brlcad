  This directory contains mega-widgets which should be considered beta
versions at best.  They will still have doc, test, and demos, but should
be considered experimental.  We're looking for positive or negative 
feedback concerning their usefullness.  Should enough of a positive
response be felt, then it shall be moved up.  Otherwise, they will find
themseleves in the outgoing directory and later in /dev/null.  Please
see the source code to respond to the correct author of any mega-widgets
found here.

>> Menubar          Author: Bill Scott     Email: bscott@spd.dsccc.com

   The menubar class attempts to simplify the syntax of menubar construction
by providing a grammar and set of commands for menubar creation.  The question
is whether its use does actually make menubars easier to produce and also
manage.
