_________________________________________________________________
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect6" HREF="#toc6"><B>DESCRIPTION</B></A></H2>

The <B>tabnotebook</B> command creates a new window (given by the
pathName argument) and makes it into a <B>tabnotebook</B> widget.
Additional options, described above may be specified on the
command line or in the option database to configure aspects
of the tabnotebook such as its colors, font, and text. The
tabnotebook command returns its pathName argument. At the
time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window
named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.
<P>
A <B>tabnotebook</B> is a widget that contains a set of tabbed
pages. It displays one page from the set as the selected
page. A Tab displays the label for the page to which it is
attached and serves as a page selector. When a page's tab is
selected, the page's contents are displayed in the page
area. The selected tab has a three-dimensional effect to
make it appear to float above the other tabs. The tabs are
displayed as a group along either the left, top, right, or
bottom edge. When first created a tabnotebook has no pages.
Pages may be added or deleted using widget commands
described below.
<P>
A special option may be provided to the tabnotebook. The
<B>-auto</B> option specifies whether the tabnotebook will automatically
handle the unpacking and packing of pages when pages
are selected. A value of true signifies that the notebook
will automatically manage it. This is the default value. A
value of false signifies the notebook will not perform
automatic switching of pages.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#toc7"><B>NOTEBOOK</B> <B>PAGES</B></A></H2>

A tabnotebook's pages area contains a single child site
frame. When a new page is created it is a child of this
frame. The page's child site frame serves as a geometry container
for applications to pack widgets into. It is this
frame that is automatically unpacked or packed when the auto
option is true. This creates the effect of one page being
visible at a time. When a new page is selected, the previously
selected page's child site frame is automatically
unpacked from the tabnotebook's child site frame and the
newly selected page's child site is packed into the
tabnotebook's child site frame.
<P>
However, sometimes it is desirable to handle page changes in
a different manner. By specifying the <B>auto</B> option as <B>false</B>,
child site packing can be disabled and done differently. For
example, all widgets might be packed into the first page's
child site <B>frame</B>. Then when a new page is selected, the
application can reconfigure the widgets and give the appearance
that the page was flipped.
<P>
In both cases the command option for a page specifies a Tcl
Command to execute when the page is selected. In the case of
<B>auto</B> being <B>true</B>, it is between the unpacking of the previously
selected page and the packing of the newly selected
page.
<P>
Notebook pages can also be controlled with scroll bars or
other widgets that obey the <B>scrollcommand</B> protocol. By giving
a scrollbar a <B>-command</B> to call the tabnotebook's <B>select</B>
method, the tabnotebook can be controlled with a scrollbar.
<P>
The notebook area is implemented with the notebook mega
widget.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect8" HREF="#toc8"><B>TABS</B></A></H2>

Tabs appear along the edge of the notebook area. Tabs are
drawn to appear attached to their associated page. When a
tab is clicked on, the associated page is selected and the
tab is drawn as raised above all other tabs and as a seamless
part of its notebook page. Tabs can be controlled in
their location along the edges, the angle tab sides are
drawn with, gap between tabs, starting margin of tabs,
internal padding around text labels in a tab, the font, and
its label.
<P>
The Tab area is implemented with the <B>tabset</B> mega widget. See
<A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man2html?tabset?1">tabset(1)</A>. Tabs may be oriented along either the north,
south, east, or west sides with the <B>tabPos</B> option. North and
south tabs may appear as angled, square, or bevelled. West
and east tabs may appear as square or bevelled. By changing
tab gaps, tab angles, bevelling, orientations, colors,
fonts, start locations, and margins; tabs may appear in a
wide variety of styles. For example, it is possible to
implement Microsoft-style tabs, Borland property tab styles,
or Borland Delphi style tabs all with the same tabnotebook.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="sect9" HREF="#toc9"><B>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</B> <B>METHODS</B></A></H2>

The <B>tabnotebook</B> command creates a new Tcl command whose name
is <I>pathName</I>. This command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget. It has the following general form:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <I>option</I> ?<I>arg</I> <I>arg</I> ...?
<P>
<I>option</I> and the <I>arg</I>s determine the exact behavior of the command.
<P>
Many of the widget commands for a notebook take as one argument
an indicator of which page of the notebook to operate
on. These indicators are called indexes and may be specified
in any of the following forms:
<P>
<I>number</I><BR>

Specifies the page numerically, where 0 corresponds to
the first page in the notebook, 1 to the second, and so
on.
<P>
<B>select</B><BR>

Specifies the currently selected page's index. If no
page is currently selected, the value -1 is returned.
<P>
<B>end</B> Specifes the last page in the tabnotebook's index. If
the notebook is empty this will return -1.
<P>
<I>pattern</I><BR>

If the index doesn't satisfy any of the above forms,
then this form is used. Pattern is pattern-matched
against the label of each page in the notebook, in
order from the first to the last page, until a matching
entry is found. The rules of Tcl_StringMatch are used.
The following commands are possible for tabnotebook
widgets:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>add</B> ?<I>option</I> <I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
Add a new page at the end of the tabnotebook. A new
child site frame is created. Returns the child site
pathName. If additional arguments are present, they
specify any of the following options:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>-angle</B> <I>value</I><DD>
Specifes the angle of slope from the inner edge to
the outer edge of the tab. An angle of 0 specifies
square tabs. Valid ranges are 0 to 45 degrees
inclusive. Default is 15 degrees. If this option
is specified as an empty string (the default),
then the angle option for the overall tabnotebook
is used. This is generally only set at the tabnotebook
level. Tabs normally will want to share
the same angle value.
<P>
</DD>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><B>-background</B> <I>value</I><DD>
Specifies a background color to use for displaying
tabs when they are selected and for displaying the
current page. If this option is specified as an
empty string (the default), then the background
option for the overall tabnotebook is used.
<P>
</DD>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><B>-bevelamount</B> <I>value</I><DD>
Specifes the size of tab corners. A value of 0
with angle set to 0 results in square tabs. A
bevelAmount of 4, means that the tab will be drawn
with angled corners that cut in 4 pixels from the
edge of the tab. The default is 0. This is generally
only set at the tabnotebook level. Tabs
normally will want to share the same bevelAmount.
<P>
</DD>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><B>-bitmap</B> <I>value</I><DD>
If label is a non-empty string, specifies a bitmap
to display in this page's tab. Bitmap may be of
any of the forms accepted by Tk_GetPixmap.
<P>
</DD>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><B>-command</B> <I>value</I><DD>
Specifies a Tcl command to be executed when this
page is selected. This allows the programmer a
hook to reconfigure this page's widgets or any
other page's widgets.
<P>
</DD>
</DL>
If the tabnotebook has the auto option set to
true, when a page is selected this command will be
called immediately after the previously selected
page is unpacked and immediately before this page
is selected. The index value select is valid during
this Tcl command. `index select' will return
this page's page number.
<P>
If the auto option is set to false, when a page is
selected the unpack and pack calls are bypassed.
This Tcl command is still called.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>-disabledforeground</B> <I>value</I><DD>

Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much
extra space to request for a tab around its label
in the X-direction. When computing how large a
window it needs, the tab will add this amount to
the width it would normally need The tab will end
up with extra internal space to the left and right
of its text label. This value may have any of the
forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If this option
is specified as an empty string (the default),
then the padX option for the overall tabnotebook
is used

Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much
extra space to request for a tab around its label
in the Y-direction. When computing how large a
window it needs, the tab will add this amount to
the height it would normally need The tab will end
up with extra internal space to the top and bottom
of its text label. This value may have any of the
forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If this option

<DT><B>-state</B> <I>value</I><DD>
Specifies one of two states for the page: normal
or disabled. In normal state unselected tabs are
displayed using the tabforeground and tabbackground
option from the tabnotebook or the page.
Selected tabs and pages are displayed using the
foreground and background option from the tabnotebook
or the page. The disabled state means that
the page and its tab is insensitive: it doesn't
respond to mouse button presses or releases. In
this state the entry is displayed according to its
disabledForeground option for the tabnotebook and
the background/tabbackground option from the page
or the tabnotebook.

<I>pathName</I> <B>childSite</B> ?<I>index</I>?<BR>

If passed no arguments, returns a list of pathNames for
all the pages in the tabnotebook. If the tab notebook
is empty, an empty list is returned
<P>
If <I>index</I> is passed, it returns the <I>pathName</I> for the
page's child site <B>frame</B> specified by <I>index</I>. Widgets
that are created with this <I>pathName</I> will be displayed
when the associated page is selected. If <I>index</I> is not a
valid index, an empty string is returned.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>configure</B> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
<P>
Query or modify the configuration options of the
widget. If no <I>option</I> is specified, returns a list
describing all of the available options for <I>pathName</I>
(see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the format of
this list). If option is specified with no value, then
the command returns a list describing the one named
option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no option is
specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns an empty string. <I>Option</I> may have any of
the values accepted by the tabnotebook command.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>delete</B> <I>index1</I> ?<I>index2</I>?<BR>

Delete all of the pages between <I>index1</I> and <I>index2</I>
inclusive. If <I>index2</I> is omitted then it defaults to
<I>index1</I>. Returns an empty string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>index</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Returns the numerical index corresponding to <I>index</I>.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>insert</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>option</I> <I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
Insert a new page in the tabnotebook before the page
specified by <I>index</I>. A new child site <B>frame</B> is created.
The additional arguments are the same as for the <B>add</B>
command. Returns the child site <I>pathName</I>.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>next</B><BR>

Advances the selected page to the next page (order is
determined by insertion order). If the currently
selected page is the last page in the notebook, the
selection wraps around to the first page in the notebook.
It behaves as if the user selected the new page.
<P>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>true</B> the current page's
child site is unpacked from the notebook's child site
frame. Then the next page's child site is packed into
the notebook's child site frame. The Tcl command given
with the command option will be invoked between these
two operations.
<P>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>false</B> the Tcl command
given with the command option will be invoked.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>pageconfigure</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
This command is similar to the <B>configure</B> command,
except that it applies to the options for an individual
page, whereas configure applies to the options for the
tabnotebook as a whole. <I>Options</I> may have any of the
values accepted by the add widget command. If options
are specified, options are modified as indicated in the
command and the command returns an empty string. If no
options are specified, returns a list describing the
current options for page index (see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B>
for information on the format of this list).
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>prev</B><BR>

Moves the selected page to the previous page (order is
determined by insertion order). If the currently
selected page is the first page in the notebook, the
selection wraps around to the last page in the notebook.
It behaves as if the user selected the new page.
<P>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>true</B> the current page's
child site is unpacked from the notebook's child site
<B>frame</B>. Then the previous page's child site is packed
into the notebook's child site frame. The Tcl command
given with the command option will be invoked between
these two operations.
<P>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>false</B> the Tcl command
given with the command option will be invoked.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>select</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Selects the page specified by <I>index</I> as the currently
selected page. It behaves as if the user selected the
new page.
<P>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>true</B> the current page's
child site is unpacked from the notebook's child site
frame. Then the <I>index</I> page's child site is packed into
the notebook's child site frame. The Tcl command given
with the command option will be invoked between these
two operations.
<P>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>false</B> the Tcl command
given with the command option will be invoked.
