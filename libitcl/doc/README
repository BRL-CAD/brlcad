 OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If you are just getting started with [incr Tcl], download the
 "tutorial" from the itcl web site:

    http://www.tcltk.com/itcl/

 This has over 100 pages of introductory text and code examples.
 I didn't include it here, since it adds another megabyte to the
 distribution, and long-time users won't need it.

 You can find the same tutorial in the book "Tcl/Tk Tools"
 published by O'Reilly and Associates.
