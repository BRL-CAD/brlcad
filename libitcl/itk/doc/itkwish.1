.SH NAME
itkwish \- Simple windowing shell for [incr\ Tcl] / [incr\ Tk]
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBitkwish\fR ?\fIfileName arg arg ...\fR?
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-display \fIdisplay\fR" 20
Display (and screen) on which to display window.
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR" 20
Initial geometry to use for window.  If this option is specified, its
value is stored in the \fBgeometry\fR global variable of the application's
Tcl interpreter.
.IP "\fB\-name \fIname\fR" 20
Use \fIname\fR as the title to be displayed in the window, and
as the name of the interpreter for \fBsend\fR commands.
.IP "\fB\-sync\fR" 20
Execute all X server commands synchronously, so that errors
are reported immediately.  This will result in much slower
execution, but it is useful for debugging.
.IP "\fB\-\|\-\fR" 20
Pass all remaining arguments through to the script's \fBargv\fR
variable without interpreting them.
This provides a mechanism for passing arguments such as \fB\-name\fR
to a script instead of having \fBitkwish\fR interpret them.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBitkwish\fR is a simple program consisting of the Tcl command
language, the Tk toolkit, the \fB[incr\ Tcl]\fR extension for
object-oriented programming, and the \fB[incr\ Tk]\fR extension
for building mega-widgets.  The main program creates an
interpreter, creates a main window, and then processes Tcl
commands from standard input or from a file.
.PP
\fBitkwish\fR is just like \fBwish\fR, but includes the
\fB[incr\ Tcl]\fR / \fB[incr\ Tk]\fR extensions.
.PP
See the \fBwish\fR man page for details concerning usage.  See
the \fBitcl\fR and \fBitk\fR man pages for an overview of
\fB[incr\ Tcl]\fR / \fB[incr\ Tk]\fR.
