.SH NAME
itk \- framework for building mega-widgets in Tcl/Tk
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Mega-widgets are high-level widgets that are constructed using
Tk widgets as component parts, usually without any C code.  A
fileselectionbox, for example, may have a few listboxes, some
entry widgets and some control buttons.  These individual widgets
are put together in a way that makes them act like one big
widget.  A fileselectionbox mega-widget can be created with a
command like:
.CS
fileselectionbox .fsb -background blue -foreground white
.CE
Once it has been created, it can be reconfigured with a command
like:
.CS
\&.fsb configure -background green -foreground black
.CE
and all of its internal components will change color.  Each
mega-widget has a set of methods that can be used to manipulate
it.  For example, the current selection can be queried from a
fileselectionbox like this:
.CS
set fileName [.fsb get]
.CE
In effect, a mega-widget looks and acts exactly like a Tk widget,
but is considerably easier to implement.
.PP
\fB[incr\ Tk]\fR is a framework for building mega-widgets.  It
uses \fB[incr\ Tcl]\fR to support the object paradigm, and adds
base classes which provide default widget behaviors.
.PP
All \fB[incr\ Tk]\fR widgets are derived from the \fBArchetype\fR
base class.  This class manages internal component widgets,
and provides methods like "configure" and "cget" to access
configuration options.
.PP
The \fBWidget\fR base class inherits everything from \fBArchetype\fR,
and adds a Tk frame which acts as a container for the mega-widget.
It is used to build mega-widgets that sit inside of other frames
and toplevels.  Derived classes create other internal components
and pack them into the "hull" frame created by the \fBWidget\fR
base class.
.PP
The \fBToplevel\fR base class inherits everything from \fBArchetype\fR,
but adds a Tk toplevel which acts as a container for the mega-widget.
It is used to build mega-widgets, such as dialog boxes, that have
their own toplevel window.  Derived classes create other internal
components and pack them into the "hull" toplevel created by the
\fBToplevel\fR base class.

.SH [incr Widgets] LIBRARY
.PP
\fB[incr\ Widgets]\fR is a mega-widget library built using
\fB[incr\ Tk]\fR.  It can be used right out of the box, and
contains more than 30 different widget classes, including:
.IP -
fileselectiondialog
.IP -
tabnotebook
.IP -
panedwindow
.IP -
combobox
.IP -
optionmenu
.IP -
scrolledlistbox
.IP -
scrolledframe
.IP -
messagedialog
.IP -
and many others...
.LP
The \fBcatalog\fR demo in the "iwidgets/demos" directory
shows all of the available widgets in action.  Each widget
class has its own man page describing the features available.
