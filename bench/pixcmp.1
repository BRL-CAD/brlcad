.SH NAME
pixcmp \- compare two pix image files pixel by pixel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pixcmp
.RB [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
\fIFILE1\fR [\fIFILE2\fR [\fISKIP1\fR [\fISKIP2\fR]]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pixcmp
is a program to compare two BRL-CAD pix image files pixel by pixel.  The following \fIOPTIONS\fR are available:
.TP
\fB\-l\fR
Output pixel numbers, counting from 1, and values for all pixels that differ.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR
Use bytes instead of pixels for both processing and output.  With this option, the \fB-i\fR SKIP values should be specified as bytes instead of pixels.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR \fISKIP\fR
Skip the first SKIP pixels of input (for FILE1 and FILE2).
.TP
\fB\-i\fR \fISKIP1\fR:\fISKIP2\fR
Skip the first SKIP1 pixels of FILE1 and the first SKIP2 pixels of FILE2.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Silent output.  Only return an exit status.
.PP
SKIP1 and SKIP2 are the number of pixels to skip in each file.
.PP
If FILE is \`\fB\-\fR\' or missing,
.I pixcmp
reads from the standard input.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.PP
The
.I pixcmp
utility returns \fB0\fR if there are no differences, \fB1\fR if there are only off-by-one differences, \fB2\fR if there are off-by-many errors, \fB126\fR if there are file processing problems, and \fB127\fR if there are argument processing or usage errors.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\fBpixcmp -l file1 file2\fR
.br
The two files are compared pixel by pixel with each difference printed instead of just the summary.
.TP
\fBpixdiff file1.pix file2.pix | pixcmp - file3.pix\fR
.br
The
.I pixdiff
tool compares the pixels in file1.pix with those in file2.pix and then outputs a resulting \`diff\' image which is then processed by
.I pixcmp
as input and compared against file3.pix, reporting on the differences.
