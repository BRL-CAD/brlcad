/** @file pixcmp.c
 *
 *  Compute the difference between two .pix files.
 *  To establish context, a monochrome image is produced when there
 *  are no differences;  otherwise the channels that differ are
 *  highlighted on differing pixels.
 *
 *  This routine operates on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and thus
 *  is independent of the resolution of the image.
