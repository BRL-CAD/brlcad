.SH NAME
benchmark \- runs the BRL-CAD benchmark
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B benchmark
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The benchmark suite will test the performance of a given system by
iteratively rendering several well-known datasets into 512x512 images
where performance metrics are documented and fairly well understood.
The local machine's performance is compared to the base system (called
VGR) and a numeric "VGR" mulitplier of performance is computed.  This
number is a simplified metric from which one may qualitatively compare
cpu and cache performance, versions of BRL-CAD, and different compiler
characteristics.
.PP
There are several environment variables that will modify how the
BRL-CAD benchmark behaves so that it may be run in a stand-alone
environment:
.PP
\&
.B RT
\- the rt binary (e.g. ../src/rt/rt or /usr/brlcad/bin/rt)
.br
\&
.B DB
\- the directory containing the reference geometry (e.g. ../db)
.br
\&
.B PIX
\- the directory containing the reference images (e.g. ../pix)
.br
\&
.B LOG
\- the directory containing the reference logs (e.g. ../pix)
.br
\&
.B CMP
\- the name of a pixcmp tool (e.g. ./pixcmp)
.br
\&
.B ELP
\- the name of an elapsed time tool (e.g. ../sh/elapsed.sh)
.br
\&
.B TIMEFRAME
\- the minimum number of seconds each trace needs to take
.br
\&
.B MAXTIME
\- the maximum number of seconds to spend on any test
.br
\&
.B DEVIATION
\- the minimum sufficient % deviation from the average
.br
\&
.B AVERAGE
\- how many frames to average together
.br
\&
.B DEBUG
\- turn on extra debug output for testing/development
.PP
The \fITIMEFRAME\fR, \fIMAXTIME\fR, \fIDEVIATION\fR, and \fIAVERAGE\fR options control how the
benchmark will proceed including how long it should take.  Each
individual benchmark run will consume at least a minimum \fITIMEFRAME\fR of
wallclock time so that the results can stabilize.  After consuming at
least the minimum \fITIMEFRAME\fR, additional frames may be computed until
the standard deviation from the last \fIAVERAGE\fR count of frames is below
the specified \fIDEVIATION\fR.  When a test is run and it completes in less
than \fITIMEFRAME\fR, the raytrace is restarted using double the number of
rays from the previous run.  If the machine is fast enough, the
benchmark may accelerate the number or rays being fired.  These
additional rays are hypersampled but without any jitter, so it's
effectively performing a multiplier amount of work over the initial
frame.
.PP
Plese send your BRL-CAD Benchmark results to the developers along with
detailed system information to <devs@brlcad.org>.  Include at least:
.PP
   0) Operating system type and version (e.g. uname -a)
   1) Compiler name and version (e.g. gcc --version)
   2) CPU configuration (e.g. cat /proc/cpuinfo or hinv or sysctl -a)
   3) Cache (data and/or instruction) details for L1/L2/L3 and system
      (e.g. cat /proc/cpuinfo or hinv or sysctl -a)
   4) Output from this script (e.g. ./run.sh > run.sh.log 2>&1)
   5) All generated log files (e.g. *.log* after running run.sh)
   6) Anything else you think might be relevant to performance
