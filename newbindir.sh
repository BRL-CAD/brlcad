#  Script to permanantly modify your copy of the BRL-CAD distribution to
#  place the installed programs in some place other than BRL's usual place.
#
#  Changed from Release 4.0
#  Formerly, this script dumped everything into one place.  Messy.
#  Now, the whole "/usr/brlcad/" tree can be re-vectored anywhere you want,
#  while preserving the tree structure below there.
#
#  Once this script is run, the "master" definition of BASEDIR is
#  kept in "machinetype.sh"
#
#  $Header$
