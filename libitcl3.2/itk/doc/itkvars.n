.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The following global variables are created and managed automatically
by the \fB[incr\ Tk]\fR library.  Except where noted below, these
variables should normally be treated as read-only by application-specific
code and by users.
.TP
\fBitk::library\fR
When an interpreter is created, \fB[incr\ Tk]\fR initializes this
variable to hold the name of a directory containing the system library
of \fB[incr\ Tk]\fR scripts.  The initial value of \fBitk::library\fR
is set from the ITK_LIBRARY environment variable if it exists,
or from a compiled-in value otherwise.
.sp
When \fB[incr\ Tk]\fR is added to an interpreter, it executes
the script "\fCinit.itk\fR" in this directory.  This script,
in turn, looks for other script files with the name "\fCinit.\fIxxx\fR".
Mega-widget libraries will be automatically initialized if they
install a script named "\fCinit.\fIxxx\fR" in this directory,
where "\fIxxx\fR" is the name of the mega-widget library.
For example, the \fB[incr\ Widgets]\fR library installs
the script "\fCinit.iwidgets\fR" in this directory.
This script establishes the "iwidgets" namespace, and sets
up autoloading for all \fB[incr\ Widgets]\fR commands.
