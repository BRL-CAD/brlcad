 Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [incr Widgets] is an object-oriented mega-widget set which extends 
 Tcl/Tk and is based on [incr Tcl] and [incr Tk].  This set of mega-widgets
 delivers many new, general purpose widgets like option menus, comboboxes, 
 selection boxes, and various dialogs whose couterparts are found in Motif 
 and Windows. Since [incr Widgets] is based on the [incr Tk] extension, the 
 Tk framework of configuration options, widget commands, and default bindings
 is maintained.  In other words, each [incr Widgets] mega-widget seamlessly 
 blends with the standard Tk widgets. They look, act and feel like Tk 
 widgets. In addition, all [incr Widgets] mega-widgets are object oriented and 
 may themselves be extended, using either inheritance or composition.

 [incr Widgets] offers a strong object-oriented foundation which addresses 
 the need for a flexible and extensible mega-widget set. Its usage replaces 
 common widget combinations with higher level abstractions, simplifying code,
 reducing errors, increasing readability, adding productivity, and promoting 
 a singular look-and-feel.  The ability to extend [incr Widgets] enables 
 developers to create new mega-widgets based on previous work.

 In short, [incr Widgets] is a library of reusable mega-widgets that can 
 be easily extended using composition or inheritance, allowing quicker 
 development of large scale applications. Usage drastically reduces 
 development time. New dialogs can be created in hours. Whole applications 
 in a few days. Reuse becomes a reality. Many projects are benefitting frm
 the intergration of this mega-widget set into their development strategy. 
 [incr Widgets] is an [incr Tcl] and [incr Tk] success story. Good products 
 come from good foundations.


 Distribution
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The [incr Widgets] distribution is included with [incr Tcl] version 2.2
 and greater. It is available via ftp at ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/extensions. 
 Consult the included release documentation for installation notes.  For
 the latest in distribution information, this web site should be consulted.

 The [incr Tcl] distribution will always include the most current release 
 of [incr Widgets] which was possible at the time of its release. It is
 anticipated that [incr Widgets] will change more rapidly than [incr Tcl]. 
 This being the case, in between [incr Tcl] releases, the latest version 
 of [incr Widgets] is also separately available via ftp at the same
 location list above as well as the web site. 

 The version number of [incr Widgets] tracks the release of [incr Tcl] 
 for which it is compatible. The version numbering system for [incr Widgets]
 includes an extra number. For example version 2.0.3 of [incr Widgets] is 
 compatible with [incr Tcl] 2.0. As the minor number of [incr Tcl] increases
 the second digit of the [incr Widgets] version varies. This makes for
 easy release identification.

 Web site
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 For the most current news regarding [incr Widgets] please consult the web
 set - http://www.tcltk.com/iwidgets.  The site contains a lot of good
 information such as tutotials, man pages, and examples.  Plus, I'm real
 proud of our new logo.  Also, catch our picture under the development
 team link.  Many thanks to the good people at Webnet Technologies for
 the excellent web production work.  Joe Bob says "Check it out !"
  

 Getting started
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The "doc" directory contains man pages and a technical paper. The man
 pages are installed under the man directory off your --prefix.  In
 addition, the makefile includes an install-html target for creating 
 a HTML version of the man pages.  They are placed under your prefixed
 doc directory.

   doc/iwidgets.ps ... Updated paper presented at Tcl Workshop 95.

   doc/*.n ........... Man pages

 The "demos" directory contains demo scripts for each mega-widget.  The
 demos are also installed under the lib directory off your --prefix.

   catalog ........... Comprehensive demo package which illustrates
                       [incr Widgets] usage additionally displaying the 
                       source.

 The "tests" directory contains a set of test scripts for [incr Widgets].
 They also make for a great demo of the flexiblity of the mega-widgets.
 Once you've built your itkwish, try firing it up and sourcing "all" in
 the tests directory.


 Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [incr Tcl] with [incr Widgets]

  As previously stated, the latest version of itcl contains the latest
  version of iwidgets.  Having the itcl distribution is a prerequsite
  to using iwidgets.  Thus, if you don't have itcl follow the these steps
  to acquire itcl and iwidgets.

  1)  Read the distribution section notes above.

  2)  Obtain the [incr Tcl] 2.x distribution from an archive site like this:

        ftp ftp.aud.alcatel.com
        cd pub/tcl/extensions
        binary
        get itcl2.2.tar.gz
        quit

  3)  Follow the directions in the itcl README file.

  If you've already got itcl and have found a newer version of iwidgets
  at alcatel, then follow the following steps.

  1)  Read the distribtion scetion notes above.

  2)  Obtain the [incr Widgets] 2.x.y distribution from an archive site 
      like this:

        ftp ftp.aud.alcatel.com
        cd pub/tcl/extensions
        binary
        get iwidgets2.2.0.tar.gz
        quit
 
  3)  cd to your compatable itcl source directory.  For example:

        cd /usr/local/src/itcl2.2

  4)  Uncompress and untar the iwidgets distribution:

        gunzip iwidgets2.2.0.tar.gz
        tar xvf iwidgets2.2.0.tar

  5)  Run the configuration script:

        cd iwidgets2.2.0/unix
        ./configure

      or, for systems that don't recognize "#!" in shell scripts:

        cd iwidgets2.2.0/unix
        /bin/sh ./configure

      By default, the configuration script will set things up
      to be installed in "/usr/local".  You can change this
      by specifying a different "prefix" in the "configure" command.
      You'll want to use the same value you used for the prefix in 
      the configuration of your itcl2.2 distribution.

        ./configure --prefix=/your/install/path

      The "configure" script generates new Makefiles from their
      respective templates (Makefile.in).

  6)  Build the iwidgets library:

        make all

  7)  Install the iwidgets library, man pages and script files.

        make install

  8)  Optionally, you can install the html'ed version of the iwidgets
      man pages:

        make install-html


 Contributions

 I feel that [incr Widgets] is a good start in the direction of establishing 
 a strong set of object-oriented mega-widgets, but I swear that everytime I 
 go back and look at the source I see an even better more simplier way 
 something could have been accomplished.  Should anybody within the Tcl/Tk 
 community come upon an even better way, a great enhancement, or an awesome 
 new mega-widget altogether, please don't hesitate to send it to the author 
 listed in the header or myself, mulferts@spd.dsccc.com, as moderator. I or 
 any of the development team members are always available via email for a 
 technical interchange of ideas.

 [incr Widgets] is a continuing effort. We have many new mega-widgets 
 currently under development and are actively looking for volunteers willing
 to contribute their own [incr Tk] based mega-widgets for inclusion into 
 the [incr Widgets] set. The distribution is moderated. Contributed 
 mega-widgets should be of good quality and complete with documentation, 
 tests, and demonstrations. Please follow the coding style found in the 
 distribution source. This includes man page and test script formats as well.
 The languages and extensions on which [incr Widgets] is based are of high 
 standards. [incr Widgets] strives to attain this same level.  Be fore
 warned, the moderator is a facist.

 Those mega-widgets which we are looking for include but are not limited 
 to the following list. Should you be interested in signing up for any of 
 those listed here, please send email to the distribution moderator: 
 mulferts@spd.dsccc.com.  Also, should you have any ideas on others not 
 listed, please send email to the same.

    Dial                        Table                     Tree
    Spreadsheet                 Printdialog               Labledframe
    Timer                       Fontdialog                Biswitch
    Colordialog                 Colorgrid                 Istrumentation
    Printdialog                 Graphs

 Any other ideas ?
