# Build Iwidgets.rsrc
#
# This script should be run in Toolserver or MPW to rebuild the
# iwidgets2.2.0.rsrc file, for instance if you change some file in the
# iwidgets distribution.
#
# Set the directory to the iwidgets2.2.0:mac directory, then
# just run this script, and then rebuild the shells, and the sharable
# libraries.
