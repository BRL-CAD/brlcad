#	unixOnly -	1 means this is a UNIX platform, so it's OK
#			to run tests that only work under UNIX.
#	macOnly -	1 means this is a Mac platform, so it's OK
#			to run tests that only work on Macs.
#	pcOnly -	1 means this is a PC platform, so it's OK to
#			run tests that only work on PCs.
#	unixOrPc -	1 means this is a UNIX or PC platform.
#	macOrPc -	1 means this is a Mac or PC platform.
#	macOrUnix -	1 means this is a Mac or UNIX platform.
#	nonPortable -	1 means this the tests are being running in
#			the master Tcl/Tk development environment;
#			Some tests are inherently non-portable because
#			they depend on things like word length, file system
#			configuration, window manager, etc.  These tests
#			are only run in the main Tcl development directory
#			where the configuration is well known.  The presence
#			of the file "doAllTests" in this directory indicates
#			that it is safe to run non-portable tests.
#	tempNotPc -	The inverse of pcOnly.  This flag is used to
#			temporarily disable a test.
#	nonBlockFiles - 1 means this platform supports setting files into
#			nonblocking mode.
#	asyncPipeClose- 1 means this platform supports async flush and
#			async close on a pipe.
#	unixExecs     - 1 means this machine has commands such as 'cat',
#			'echo' etc available.

# test fails.  If VERBOSE has been set, it also prints a message
# even if the test succeeds.  The test will be skipped if it
# doesn't match the TESTS variable, or if one of the elements
# of "constraints" turns out not to be true.
#
# Arguments:
# name -		Name of test, in the form foo-1.2.
# description -		Short textual description of the test, to
#			help humans understand what it does.
# constraints -		A list of one or more keywords, each of
#			which must be the name of an element in
#			the array "testConfig".  If any of these
#			elements is zero, the test is skipped.
#			This argument may be omitted.
# script -		Script to run to carry out the test.  It must
#			return a result that can be checked for
#			correctness.
# answer -		Expected result from script.
