BRL-CAD Bugs
============

Bugs should be reported to the bug tracker on the project website at
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=640802&group_id=105292

The bugs and issues listed in here may or may not be the same as or
related to the bugs reported to the bug tracker.  In general, users
should not look to this file for information regarding the status of
bugs.  Informal bug-related information that is intended for
developers will generally be found here.  This may include short term
issues that are in active development as well as long term and
on-going issues.

Recent Bugs
-----------

* Create menu.. create "part" boo hiss..

* xpush sometimes doesn't work, e.g. objects with empty trees,
  resulting in the db being left in a bad situation.

* wavelet isn't working correctly on a simple image decomposition &
  reconstruction.

* query_ray can't find nirt if not installed

* fbed is looking for /usr/lib/vfont/nonie.r.12

* mged doesn't check if html_dir does not exist when searching for
  docs/browser.

* permute then translate doesn't refresh the graphics window
    permute 4378
    translate menus
    p 0 0 0
    p 0 0 0

* constrained axis translation bindings on OS X don't work
    object/matrix edit
    shift-alt mouse (left/mid/right for x/y/z respectively) should work

* mged documentation doesn't open on OS X
   
* the findfont directive in gv postscript is reporting font not found

* concave arbs give correct wireframe but do not raytrace correctly.

* rtwizard/rtedge creates incorrect "fuzzy" edge overlay when creating
  a "Ghost Image with Insert and Lines" that includes a light source
  and object close to surface (e.g. moss.g; select plane, light, and
  cone for ghost; select cone for insert and lines.)

* rtwizard doesn't work with perspective

* mged's solid illuminate doesn't work when Lighting is turned on

* raytrace of -s64 and remote -F/dev/Xl crashes inside an empty memcpy

* g2asc exports attr lines but will not grok them on asc2g

* mged's matrix selection does not modify the correct matrix if there
  are multiply referenced non-unique paths (e.g. referencing the same
  object N times in a combination).

* facetize -t doesn't work (tnurb support)

* on os x, the -fast option results in an odd optimization/aliasing
  bug where rtip contents are lost in rt after returning from
  rt_gettrees().

* report of rtwizard hanging at 40% on Debian (from binary distro)

* make extrude crashes

* tra in console mode outputs a warning about mged_players

* mged primitive editor doesn't accept/apply values to disk for
  certain primitives (e.g. sph)

* photon map cache file doesn't work (seems to crash rt on use)

* enabling perspective mode horks shaded mode, also Z clipping
  shouldn't be required to get the shading.

* an underlay framebuffer does not underlay with shaded mode

* bu_malloc() function and company take an unsigned int argument and
  will overflow without notification (since it is unsigned) resulting
  in less memory allocated than one requested.

* rtweight chokes on a .density file that has less than 3 values per
  line (infinite loop).  also gives infinite areas when presented with
  an empty .density file.

* libfb and libdm have hardcoded XMAXSCREEN and YMAXSCREEN values that
  are easily being surpassed on certain systems..

* setting src/librt/db5_io.c's AVS_ADD off in db5_import_attributes
  causes bad things to happen and it really shouldn't.

* vrml exporter (and probably others) doesn't export primitives
  directly as one might expect like the ray-tracers, only regions.

* if you turn off compilation of tcl/itcl, btclsh/mged fail to find
  their scripts.

* sketches extruded with non-square AB vectors results in inner sketch
  components not getting scaled properly.

* rtcheck is ignoring fastgen tagged geometry since no multioverlap
  handler is set.

* bot-bldxf fails in db_walk_tree(), interface may have changed

* bwmod gives a divide by zero error whenever you use the "-d" option

* you can't run a make benchmark unless you're compiling in place


Older Bugs
----------

* several manpages are missing or out of date for various tools

* X11 framebuffer often fails to display on certain middle bit depth
  displays. (e.g. 15 or 16 bit depth)


Annoyances
----------

* matrix edits on objects in mged require you to select a primitive
  for a coordinate system reference.  this can be counterintuitive and
  confusing.

* there are frequently modality errors when entering edit mode as
  control and middle mouse rebind to model edit instead of view edit.
