============

Bugs should be reported to the bug tracker on the project website at
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=640802&group_id=105292

The bugs and issues listed in here may or may not be the same as or
related to the bugs reported to the bug tracker.  In general, users
should not look to this file for information regarding the status of
bugs.  Informal bug-related information that is intended for
developers will generally be found here.  This may include short term
issues that are in active development as well as long term and
on-going issues.

Recent Bugs
-----------

* primitive selection in mged is busted, dies with a an error in
  solid_illum (src/tclscripts/mged/illum.tcl) with _mged_ill returning
  a db_lookup failure on "-n".

* fast4-g skips lines while processing if there are DOS line endings

* pipe primitive has a BU_GETSTRUCT malloc getting called during
  raytracing that kills performance by more than an order of magnitude
  (especially when the light source is a pipe and there are a lot of
  shadow rays)

* bump shader seems to be busted.  only renders as flat by itself and
  stacked with phong it seems to ignore the uv settings.

* rtweight prints incorrect units when units are set to ft.  Appears
  to trace back to unit handling in view_end in viewweight.c.  This
  logic should be replaced using the proper libbu functions.

* the graphics window does not acquire keybinding focus in mged on
  ubuntu linux.  key events go to the command window even with the
  graphics window has focus.

* /dev/ogl framebuffer is not refreshing/updating on mac os x,
  resulting in the window remaining blank until you give expose events

* report of mged being locked up on startup taking full cpu, works
  fine with with -c with X dm.

* MGED File->Preferences->Fonts results in error "named font "button
  _font" doesn't exist on Linux.

* lingering default isn't working for at least one linux user

* rtwizard seems to be busted (again)

* mged tab-completion doesn't work if the object names have spaces

* OpenGL display manager doesn't refresh automatically when the
  context is invalidated (on Mac OS X) any more

* Open dialog in MGED seems rather busted for scrolling and selection
  (seems to be Mac OS X specific)

* turning on Framebuffer->Rectangle Area in mged disables the
  embedded framebuffer diplay on Mac OS X when you sweep a raytrace
  rectangle.  sweeping still works if you leave it at All.

* invalid shaders result in an "Unable to locate where BRL-CAD ... is
  installed" message that refers to being unable to find a
  /lib/libSHADER.so file.  Quite a bogus message and probably not
  something that should abort the ray-trace.

* rtedge seems to get stuck in a loop at the end of rendering, never
  terminates (unless you rtabort/kill the process); works with -P1

* nirt fails to report LOS and sometimes even hits on a BoT that is
  marked as unoriented or is inverted (even though it sometimes will
  report the segments, just without LOS)

* nirt/query_ray reports intersection messages in triplicate if the
  shot routines miss but still print out messages

* mged's plot tool (the gui one, not the 'plot' command) outputs a
  plot file that has an erase as the last command, causing empty plots

* interactive mouse edits in mged can go haywire on Mac OS X with
  snap-to-grid enabled

* overlap tool in mged encourages very inefficient CSG operations
  (e.g. a simple bolt with an entire hull armor subtracted)

* BoT values are always listed in mm when a point is selected instead
  of in current editing units.

* a character is (still) sometimes captured by the cursor box

* permute (in mged) requires apply or save before 'new' vertex values
  will function properly as keypoints.

* facedef then move face undoes the facedef in mged

* dsp primitive is going into what seems to be an unbounded memory
  allocation loop during prep, inside dsp_layers().

* crashes during photonmap raytrace of m35 where right node is invalid
  rt -o test.pix -V 1.0 -P4 -J0 -l7 -A0 ~/Desktop/m35.g all.g box.r sph.r

* libfb cannot utilize standard output/error "device" files without
  path trickery.  it recognizes the /dev/ prefix and presumes it's a
  libfb device instead of a filesystem device.

   OK: rt -F/./dev/stdout
  BAD: rt -F/dev/stdout

* libfb cannot open a file descriptor when piping/redirecting output.

   OK: rt -F/./dev/stdout moss.g all.g
  BAD: rt -F/./dev/stdout moss.g all.g > test.pix

* ray-tracers assume a seekable output stream.  libfb reports numerous
  fseek errors and outputs slightly corrupted pix data.

   OK: rt -o test.pix moss.g all.g && pix-png test.pix > test.png && rm -f test.pix
  BAD: rt -o /dev/stdout moss.g all.g | pix-png > test.png

* running any of the various mged commands (e.g. clicking the raytrace
  button many times quickly, or running rtarea on a large model) that
  output a lot of data will hang mged (idle cpu utilization).

* mged in console mode goes into an inf loop if you try to read from
  stdin using Tcl routines (e.g. read stdin, fgets stdin blah).

* mged in GUI mode rejects reads on stdin

* solids.sh regression test fails on Mac OS X with one pixel
  off-by-many on the edge of the middle ARB8 when using an optimized
  -O3 compile (-fno-unsafe-math-optimizations makes no difference)

* tessellation of some pipe in toyjeep.g fails (rather reliably) on
  some given bend

* tgc reports one hit errors though hit point has 0,0,0 direction
  implying that maybe the point was supposedly deleted.

* rtedge is not respecting the -c"set" options.  needs to give some
  indication that they were parsed too since it ignores unrecognized
  values apparently.

* fbhelp sends some of the output to stdout and some to stderr...

* debugbu 2 immediately reports a bu_vls_free() error.. apparently
  been a problem since 4.5 days.  this occurs because
  bu_memdebug_add() is not called unless memory checking is enabled
  via bu_debug.  so when bu_debug is set to 2 or 3, it ends up
  reporting errors during bu_free() for items that were allocated and
  were not yet being tracked.

* mged View menu says I and O are keybindings for zoom in/out -- they
  are apparently not.

* raytracers report the wrong amount of cumulative time (reports as
  0.0 seconds elapsed) on amd64 linux; most likely the same pthread
  accounting bug visited a couple years ago.

* Create menu.. create "part" boo hiss..

* wavelet isn't working correctly on a simple image decomposition &
  reconstruction.

* query_ray can't find nirt if not installed

* fbed is looking for /usr/lib/vfont/nonie.r.12

* mged doesn't check if html_dir does not exist when searching for
  docs/browser.

* permute then translate doesn't refresh the graphics window
    permute 4378
    translate menus
    p 0 0 0
    p 0 0 0

* constrained axis translation bindings on OS X don't work
    object/matrix edit
    shift-alt mouse (left/mid/right for x/y/z respectively) should work

* mged documentation doesn't open on OS X

* the findfont directive in gv postscript is reporting font not found

* concave arbs give correct wireframe but do not raytrace correctly.

* rtwizard/rtedge creates incorrect "fuzzy" edge overlay when creating
  a "Ghost Image with Insert and Lines" that includes a light source
  and object close to surface (e.g. moss.g; select plane, light, and
  cone for ghost; select cone for insert and lines.)

* rtwizard doesn't work with perspective

* mged's solid illuminate doesn't work when Lighting is turned on

* raytrace of -s64 and remote -F/dev/Xl crashes inside a memcpy during
  the first fb_write().  seems to only occur on an unbuffered render
  to a X24 framebuffer, incremental/buffered worked fine.  acts like
  stack corruption.

* g2asc exports attr lines but will not grok them on asc2g

* mged's matrix selection does not modify the correct matrix if there
  are multiply referenced non-unique paths (e.g. referencing the same
  object N times in a combination).

* facetize -t doesn't work (tnurb support)

* on os x, the -fast option results in an odd optimization/aliasing
  bug where rtip contents are lost in rt after returning from
  rt_gettrees().

* report of rtwizard hanging at 40% on Debian (from binary distro)

* make extrude crashes

* tra in console mode outputs a warning about mged_players

* mged primitive editor doesn't accept/apply values to disk for
  certain primitives (e.g. sph)

* photon map cache file doesn't work (seems to crash rt on use)

* enabling perspective mode horks shaded mode, also Z clipping
  shouldn't be required to get the shading.

* an underlay framebuffer does not underlay with shaded mode

* bu_malloc() function and company take an unsigned int argument and
  will overflow without notification (since it is unsigned) resulting
  in less memory allocated than one requested.

* rtweight chokes on a .density file that has less than 3 values per
  line (infinite loop).  also gives infinite areas when presented with
  an empty .density file.

* setting src/librt/db5_io.c's AVS_ADD off in db5_import_attributes
  causes bad things to happen and it really shouldn't.

* vrml exporter (and probably others) doesn't export primitives
  directly as one might expect like the ray-tracers, only regions.

* sketches extruded with non-square AB vectors results in inner sketch
  components not getting scaled properly.

* rtcheck is ignoring fastgen tagged geometry since no multioverlap
  handler is set.

* bot-bldxf fails in db_walk_tree(), interface may have changed

* you can't run a make benchmark unless you're compiling in place


Older Bugs
----------

* several manpages are missing or out of date for various tools

* X11 framebuffer often fails to display on certain middle bit depth
  displays. (e.g. 15 or 16 bit depth)

* mk_lcomb fails on large combinations due to mk_tree_pure() building
  a left-heavy tree and wdb_put_internal() then recursively performing
  lookup and put calls.


Annoyances
----------

* matrix edits on objects in mged require you to select a primitive
  for a coordinate system reference.  this can be counterintuitive and
  confusing.

* there are frequently modality errors when entering edit mode as
  control and middle mouse rebind to model edit instead of view edit.
