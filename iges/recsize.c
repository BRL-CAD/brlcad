/* Routine to determine record size of IGES file.
	According to the spec, the file should be
	80 characters per record.  The spec does not
	mention anything about CR or LF at the end of records,
	so this routine looks for LF's and returns the actual
	record length.
	Note: this will work for files with records that are
	80 characters long without any CR or LF at end of records,
	also for files with CR-LF at end of records, and for files
	with just LF at end of records.  It will not work for files
	with just CR at end of records (but I haven't seen such an animal
	yet) */
