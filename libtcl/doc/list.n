.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlist \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command returns a list comprised of all the \fIarg\fRs,
or an empty string if no \fIarg\fRs are specified.
Braces and backslashes get added as necessary, so that the \fBindex\fR command
may be used on the result to re-extract the original arguments, and also
so that \fBeval\fR may be used to execute the resulting list, with
\fIarg1\fR comprising the command's name and the other \fIarg\fRs comprising
its arguments.  \fBList\fR produces slightly different results than
\fBconcat\fR:  \fBconcat\fR removes one level of grouping before forming
the list, while \fBlist\fR works directly from the original arguments.
For example, the command
.CS
\fBlist a b {c d e} {f {g h}}\fR
.CE
will return
.CS
\fBa b {c d e} {f {g h}}\fR
.CE
while \fBconcat\fR with the same arguments will return
.CS
\fBa b c d e f {g h}\fR
.CE
