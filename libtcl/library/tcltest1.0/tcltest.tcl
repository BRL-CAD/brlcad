# tcltest.tcl --
#
#	This file contains support code for the Tcl test suite.  It 
#       defines the ::tcltest namespace and finds and defines the output
#       directory, constraints available, output and error channels, etc. used
#       by Tcl tests.  See the README file for more details.
#       
#       This design was based on the Tcl testing approach designed and
#       initially implemented by Mary Ann May-Pumphrey of Sun Microsystems.

# grep --
#
# Evaluate a given expression against each element of a list and return all

# the perl grep command where CURRENT_ELEMENT would be the name for the special
# variable $_.
#
# Examples of usage would be:
#   set subList [grep {CURRENT_ELEMENT == 1} $listOfNumbers]
#   set subList [grep {regexp {abc} CURRENT_ELEMENT} $listOfStrings]
#
# Use of the CURRENT_ELEMENT keyword is optional.  If it is left out, it is
# assumed to be the final argument to the expression provided.

# Example:
#   grep {regexp a} $someList   
#
