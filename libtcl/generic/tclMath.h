 *	This file is necessary because of Metrowerks CodeWarrior Pro 1
 *	on the Macintosh. With 8-byte doubles turned on, the definitions of
 *	sin, cos, acos, etc., are screwed up.  They are fine as long as
 *	they are used as function calls, but if the function pointers
 *	are passed around and used, they will crash hard on the 68K.
