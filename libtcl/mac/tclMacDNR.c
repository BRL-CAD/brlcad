 *	C++ style comments and will not compile under the "ANSI Strict"
 *	mode that the rest of Tcl compiles under.  Furthermore, the Apple
 *	license prohibits me from redistributing a corrected version of
 *	dnr.c.  This file uses a pragma to turn off the Strict ANSI option
 *	and then includes the dnr.c file.
