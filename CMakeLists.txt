# This file defines the toplevel CMake build logic for BRL-CAD.
# As best as is reasonably possible, proper ordering and
# separation of tests and settings should be maintained per the
# recommended standard layout.  The tests should be added to the
# labeled sections below so that they are organized in stages as
# follows:
#
#   Stage 0 - information on the package and toplevel CMake settings
#   Stage 1 - define top level options
#   Stage 2 - check programs
#   Stage 3 - check compiler characteristics
#   Stage 4 - check libraries
#   Stage 5 - check headers
#   Stage 6 - check types/structures
#   Stage 7 - check functions
#   Stage 8 - check system services
#   Stage 9 - output a summary
#
# The output summary should report key information about the final
# configuration of the build.  Comprehensive information is available
# in the CMake cache file in the build directory, so just hit the
# high points in the summary.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Searching the system for packages presents something of a dilemma -
# in most situations it is Very Bad for a BRL-CAD build to be using
# older versions of libraries in install directories as search results.
# Generally, the desired behavior is to ignore whatever libraries are
# in the install directories, and only use external library results if
# they are something already found on the system due to non-BRL-CAD
# installation (source compile, package managers, etc.).  Unfortunately,
# CMake's standard behavior is to add CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the search
# path once defined, resulting in (for us) the unexpected behavior of
# returning old installed libraries when CMake is re-run in a directory.
#
# To work around this, there are two possible approaches.  One,
# identified by Maik Beckmann, operates on CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH:
#
# http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2010-October/040292.html
#
# The other, pointed out by Michael Hertling, uses the
# CMake_[SYSTEM_]IGNORE_PATH variables.
#
# http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2011-May/044503.html
#
# BRL-CAD initially operated on CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH, but has
# switched to using the *_IGNORE_PATH variables.  This requires
# CMake 2.8.3 or later.
#
# The complication with ignoring install paths is if we are
# installing to a "legitimate" system search path - i.e. our
# CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX value is standard enough that it is a legitimate
# search target for find_package. In this case, we can't exclude
# accidental hits on our libraries without also excluding legitimate
# find_package results.  So the net results are:
#
# 1.  If you are planning to install to a system directory (typically
#     a bad idea but the settings are legal) clean out the old system
#     first or accept that the old libraries will be found and used.
#
# 2.  For more custom paths, the logic below will avoid the value
#     of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in find_package searches
#
# (Note:  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX must be checked in the case where someone
# sets it on the command line prior to CMake being run.  BRLCAD_PREFIX
# preserves the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX setting from the previous CMake run.
# CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX does not seem to be immediately set in this context
# when CMake is re-run unless specified explicitly on the command line.
# To ensure the previous (and internally set) CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX value
# is available, BRLCAD_PREFIX is used to store the value in the cache.)

# By default (as of version 2.8.2) CMake does not provide access to
# global lists of executable and library targets.  This is useful
# in a number of situations related to formulating custom rules and
# target dependency management.  To avoid the necessity of replacing
# add_library and add_executable calls with custom macros, override
# the function names and call the _add_* functions to access the CMake
# functionality previously available under the add_* functions. See
# http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2010-September/039388.html

# To allow a hypothetical parent build to disable this mechanism and
# replace it, we wrap the whole show in an IF conditional.  To avoid
# the distcheck setup, the parent file should define the variable
# BRLCAD_IS_SUBBUILD to ON.  Note that this also disables the
# liblib prefix check in add_library, making that the responsibility
# of the parent build as well, and disables the mechanism for ensuring
# that the timing code runs at the correct points during the build.

# We also need to provide bookkeeping logic here for the distribution
# verification or "distcheck" routines that will validate the state
# of the source tree against that expected and accounted for in the
# build files.  The global coverage needed for the purpose results in
# the add_library/add_executable command override mechanism having
# to serve two purposes at once; since we only override these functions
